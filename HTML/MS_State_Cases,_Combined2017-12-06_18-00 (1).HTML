</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for the capital murder of a child while engaged in the commission of felonious child abuse, the murder of his stepson, who was the child's father, and the murder of the stepson's wife. During his second trial, the jury convicted him on all three murder charges. He was sentenced to death for the capital murder of the child. The supreme court affirmed, stating that testimony admitted by the wife's sister involving an insurance scam with defendant was properly admitted pursuant to Miss. R. Evid. 403, 404(b), and 804(b)(5) because the declarant was unavailable and because the trial court analyzed the five requirements for admission of the hearsay. Those requirements were trustworthiness, materiality, probative value, interests of justice, and notice. Defendant's Confrontation Clause rights were not violated under U.S. Const. amend. VI or Miss. Const. art. III, &sect; 26 because he made no objection at trial that his right was violated. The trial court also determined that the declarant, the wife, was unavailable, and it made an on-the-record examination that the evidence possessed adequate indicia of reliability and particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee purchaser filed a complaint alleging that an implied easement by necessity existed across a plot of land owned by appellants, three adjoining owners, who filed a motion to dismiss, which was joined by third seller, alleging that the purchaser failed to serve them with process within 120 days as required by Miss. R. Civ. P. 4(h). The Chancery Court of Tishomingo County (Mississippi) denied the motion to dismiss. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The chancellor stated that the purchaser had shown good cause for not serving process on the two owners within the 120-day period of Rule 4(h). The purchaser filed his complaint on January 7, 2004. Rule 4(h) required service of a summons and complaint upon a defendant within 120 days after filing the complaint. Service of the summons on all the owners should have occurred by May 6, 2004. Two of the three owners were never served with process. Even at the time of the hearing on August 20, 2004, neither had ever been served with a summons. Furthermore, the purchaser did not move for an extension of time, nor did he assert good cause as to why service was not timely made. At the hearing, counsel for the purchaser alleged that the reason for not effecting proper service was because of ongoing settlement discussions. However, the two owners were not part of those discussions. The Supreme Court of Mississippi found that the chancellor erred in failing to dismiss the two owners pursuant to Rule 4(h) and 4(e) for failure to serve process as required and that the chancellor abused his discretion in failing to set out specific reasons as to findings of fact in his order or his bench opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. The case was remanded with instructions that (1) the chancellor dismiss the case without prejudice as to the two owners and (2) consider anew the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction filed by the other owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted, before the Neshoba County Circuit Court, Mississippi, of the sale of cocaine, in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139(a)(1) (Rev. 2001). Defendant timely appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a meeting with law enforcement agents, a confidential informant purchased rock cocaine from defendant at defendant's residence. At issue on appeal was whether defendant was denied an impartial jury drawn from a representative cross-section of his community. The State conceded that the black population was a distinctive group within the county. The State correctly pointed out, however, that the proper test was not how many black people actually served on the jury; rather, the proper test was whether the method used to draw the venire led to a fair representation of the black population within the county. The supreme court determined that defendant failed to establish a prima facie showing of a violation of the fair-cross section requirement. Moreover, defendant primarily relied on counsel's argument in his motion, and he failed to show systematic exclusion. Defendant also claimed on appeal that he was improperly denied a mistrial after the admission of certain testimony. The supreme court found that the trial judge did everything he could, short of granting a mistrial, to keep the jury from considering the improper testimony of the witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court affirmed the circuit court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a paternity action, the Newton County Chancery Court, Mississippi, adjudicated appellee, the father, as the subject child's natural father. Appellant, the mother, had objected to the father's petition to have the child's surname changed. She had filed a motion to amend the judgment, but she did not act on it. Almost three years later, at a final hearing on paternity, the chancery court held she had abandoned said motion. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order entered by the chancellor in November 2000 was a final determination as to paternity and the change of the child's surname. The order was &quot;temporary&quot; only as it related to custody, support, and visitation. The final hearing did not occur until July 2003. On appeal, the mother argued that she had a fundamental right, as a mother, to retain the birth name given to her child, and that the paternal presumption in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-9-9(1) constituted both a due process and equal protection violation. First, although other jurisdictions had established that a parent had a fundamental constitutional right in his/her child's name, the state supreme court had not recognized that same was fundamental. Secondly, she had made no challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 93-9-9(1) in her motion to alter or amend, and the father and the trial court were first apprised of her constitutional challenge when she appealed to the supreme court. Third, the Mississippi Attorney General had received no notice of her constitutional challenge until he received her appellate brief. Thus, the supreme court held the issue abandoned, and also procedurally barred per Miss. R. Civ. P. 24(d).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the chancery court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner city filed a complaint in the nature of a petition to ratify and confirm the extension of its boundaries. The senior status judge appointed to hear the case issued a decision that certain legislation was constitutional. The city later amended its complaint. The Second Judicial District of the Chancery Court of Jones County, Mississippi, granted the annexation as to the land as to one area only. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city argued that the annexation met with the indicium of reasonableness and that the chancellor erred in finding that the indicia weakly suggested annexation of a smaller portion of the area. The city argued that the chancellor was correct in his assertion that the city had experienced spillover growth; however, an exhibit demonstrated spillover in all areas of the proposed annexation area, and it was not limited to a certain area. Although the city's population had declined, the city only lost a small amount of people. The city was also 72.4 percent developed. The supreme court found that the chancellor did not issue an order as to his findings and ruling on the issue of whether H.B. 1730, Reg. Sess. (Miss. 1996) violated Miss. Const. &sect; 88. In addition, the supreme court had insufficient information based upon the chancellor's opinion to base its determination. Some of the indicia of reasonableness that the chancery court used was adequate; however, the 12 indicia overall were not detailed enough pursuant to its application to each parcel.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. III, &sect; 26.</SPAN></P>

The county argued that the circuit judge should have applied the Strickland standard. The court affirmed and held that the county did not present any evidence on any one of the central factual allegations in its complaint and did not try to show specific examples of when the public defenders' legal representation fell below the objective standard of professional reasonableness. It was well established that each county was an agency or subdivision of the State, created for administration and other public purposes. As to expert testimony, the circuit judge allowed opinion testimony as long as there was sufficient background testimony to render the opinion helpful, and her refusal to allow an expert to answer two &quot;ultimate issue&quot; questions was not abuse of discretion. Further, the circuit judge did not treat the testimony of various judges as expert opinion testimony on the issue of whether the public defenders were providing constitutionally adequate representation, so the admission thereof was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

The residents argued that a water or sewer district, being a statutory creation, could only exercise those powers expressly granted or necessarily implied by the legislature. The district did have authority under Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 19-5-173 &amp; -175 to enact an ordinance which would protect its water supply; this action was not preempted by the Mississippi Individual On-Site Wastewater Disposal System Law. Nevertheless, the chancellor erred in granting summary judgment. There was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the ordinance enacted by the district conflicted with rules and regulations adopted by the Mississippi Department of Health. A determination was required as to whether any of the Department of Health's policies were impacted by the ordinance. Summary judgment was also inappropriate as to the residents' takings argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed the judgment, and the matter was remanded for additional proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner claimed he was an unwilling participant in a robbery scheme which resulted in two brutal murders of the victim and his two-year-old son. Petitioner raised claims of error as to his psychiatric exam in the presence of a police officer; the State's disclosure of exculpatory evidence; his counsel's failure to call an expert witness as to which gun fired the fatal shot, to conduct adequate discovery and voir dire, and to request parole eligibility instructions; and the disproportionality and excessiveness of his sentence. The court held that petitioner waived many of the issues by failing to raise them at trial or on direct appeal and was, therefore, barred by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21(1) (Supp. 1994). The court rejected petitioner's claim that he was less culpable than the co-participant and that his sentence was disproportionate and excessive because under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-1-3 (Rev. 2000) they were equally culpable for the capital murders where they both conspired to rob and kill the victims, petitioner admitted he fired one shot at the father, and petitioner failed to support his claim of mental retardation that would entitle him to an Atkins hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied petitioner's request for post-conviction relief, holding that it found no error requiring vacation of the judgment of conviction and imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant church administration filed an interlocutory appeal of orders of the Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which directed defendant to produce requested discovery and denied defendant's motion to dismiss an action by plaintiffs, a mother and three children, for several claims that arose from the alleged sexual molestation of the children by defendant's priest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the parents learned of allegations of molestation and confronted church officials, the priest was allowed to remain in the parish and continued to abuse children. The court held that enforcing the duty to protect against sexual molestation of children would not excessively entangle the courts in religious matters. The level of authority by defendant over its priests belied any notion that defendant was immune from claims against it under the theory of vicarious liability. There is nothing remotely religious about such reprehensible conduct such as molestation. Plaintiffs' claim of negligent hiring, retention and supervision of the priest was simply a negligence claim. Thus the court found no merit to the assertion that the Free Exercise Clause deprived civil courts of jurisdiction over plaintiffs' complaint. The cloak of religion, which does not shield religious institutions from civil responsibility for fraud or breach of contract, surely could not serve to shield such institutions from civil responsibility for more abhorrent conduct such as sexual molestation of a child. Finally, limited privilege waivers did not serve to waive privilege generally under Miss. R. Evid. 503.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the circuit court's decision denying the motion to dismiss and vacated the discovery order, and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) sought review of an order entered by the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, (Mississippi), which reversed the order of the Board of Trustees of PERS Board. The Board had denied appellee claimant's request for disability benefits. The claimant then appealed to the circuit court and was granted relief. When PERS appealed, the claimant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant was a public school teacher who complained of neck pain and stopped working. Even though medical reports showed great progress and no blanket restrictions on working, the claimant did not return to work. The court concluded that the circuit court erred by reversing the PERS decision to deny the claimant disability benefits because the PERS decision was supported by substantial evidence, was not arbitrary and capricious, was made within the scope or power granted to PERS, and did not violate the claimant's constitutional rights. The court noted that the claimant did not meet her burden to prove to the PERS medical board that she was disabled because although she may have needed her surgery, she was clearly able but unwilling to return to her job as a teacher. The court rejected the claimant's cross-appeal, finding in part that a physician's report challenged by the claimant was not hearsay, even though the report was written by someone not present at the hearing. The court noted that PERS did not have the subpoena powers to compel the report's author to be present. The court determined that there was no denial of due process to the claimant in the PERS proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On direct appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the circuit court, and it rendered judgment reinstating the denial of disability benefits by the PERS Board of Trustees. The court affirmed on cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the two actions were consolidated. The court found that the district failed to follow the clear procedures outlined in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 51-29-39. Appellants all had an interest in the property, but not one of them were served. Furthermore, the only two individuals who had a present possessory interest in the property were not made parties to the petition. The court concluded that the trial court erred in holding that no notice was required to appellants. It also found that the failure to give notice and to join all interested parties was a denial of due process. Finally, the court determined that the trial court needed to determine on remand the amount of compensation to be awarded to appellants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1963, the city and power company entered into a service area agreement.

The court held: (1) the chancellor erred in his finding that the city lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of H.B. 997, but the error was harmless; (2) In granting partial summary judgment, the chancellor correctly interpreted and applied H. B. 997 as expressly clarifying the intended legislative interpretation to be given to the amendments to &sect;&sect; 77-3-13, -17 &amp; -21; (3) the chancellor appropriately granted partial summary judgment pending the city's petition to the MPSC for approval of its proposed purchase of the power company's service rights and distribution facilities within an annexed area in accordance with the 1963 Agreement; (4) the chancellor did not err in finding that H.B. 997 did not violate the Contracts Clause of the federal and state constitutions because the regulation of the state's public utilities fell within the legislature's authority, and inasmuch as the city failed to secure MPSC approval, its contractual rights had not vested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate alleged that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to pursue a Batson claim. However, the trial court found that some of the State's reasons for striking African-American jurors were a close call but accepted them and allowed the challenges to stand. Additionally, the supreme court found that the inmate did not show that a different outcome would have resulted had the Batson objections been sustained. Thus, the inmate's attorneys were not ineffective on that issue. Also, the inmate's attorneys were not ineffective because they (1) filed numerous pre-trial motions; (2) cross-examined nine out of 11 prosecution witnesses; (3) ultimately decided not to call a witness because he would have corroborated the State's witnesses; and (4) one of them met with him on numerous occasions and even discussed a plea offer from the State with him, which the inmate ultimately rejected. In addition, the accusation that trial counsel failed to properly investigate was merely an unfounded allegation. Further, in the capital murder case, the evidence was sufficient to find the inmate guilty of the underlying offense of robbery because he killed the victim and took her house and car keys.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Lawrence County Chancery Court, Mississippi, dismissed appellant guidance counselor's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the statutes authorizing appeals to the chancery court from school board decisions, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-9-101 to 37-9-113 (Rev. 2001), were unconstitutional. The counselor and appellee school district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The chancery could held sua sponte that the Education Employment Procedures Law, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-9-101 to 37-9-113, unconstitutionally conferred jurisdiction to the chancery court. Both parties argued that the chancellor incorrectly held that the statutes were unconstitutional. The appellate court found that in light of the fact that neither of the parties raised the constitutionality of Mississippi's Education Employment Procedures Law, the chancellor exceeded his powers in raising the issue sua sponte. Appeals of state board and agency decisions generally fell under the constitutional purview of &quot;matters in equity.&quot; Review of board and agency decisions (and, in particular, school board decisions) fell under the scope of those matters in equity which the Mississippi Constitution permitted chancery courts to hear. The chancellor erred in concluding otherwise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and remanded for the purpose of reviewing whether the decision not to renew the counselor's contract was supported by substantial evidence, was arbitrary and capricious, was beyond the power of the administrative agency to make, or was in violation of the counselor's statutory or constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Harrison County Circuit Court (Mississippi) of murder.

</DIV>

For two days defendant led the husband to believe that his wife was alive and well. Defendant was captured by the police when he attempted to pickup the ransom money. On appeal, the court found that (1) many of defendant's arguments had been rejected before in prior proceedings and were barred by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21; (2) the trial court did not err in allowing an officer's expert testimony as to blood spatters; (3) there was sufficient proof of aggravating circumstances to support defendant's death sentence under Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Lowndes Circuit Court (Mississippi) that convicted him of capital murder pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(2)(e) and of kidnapping his ex-girlfriend, and that sentenced him to death based on the finding that he killed his ex-girlfriend's brother during the commission of burglary, a felony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised numerous claims of error, including ineffective assistance of counsel, jury instruction errors, a defective indictment, improperly admitted evidence of other crimes and photographs, and the jury's consideration of an invalid aggravator. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for the underlying crime of burglary, where the evidence showed he broke into his girlfriend's home with the intent to kill her. Also the kidnapping conviction was supported by evidence that showed the girlfriend did no go with defendant voluntarily. The court found that the &quot;avoiding lawful arrest&quot; aggravating circumstance was properly submitted to the jury because the evidence showed that defendant killed the girlfriend's brother in an attempt to conceal his identity or to &quot;cover his tracks.&quot; The court found that the capital murder indictment sufficiently specified the underlying burglary felony and that defendant was not entitled to a manslaughter instruction. Also any error in the admission of prior bad act evidence was harmless and the photograph of the murder victim was not unduly gruesome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant participated in the beating death of several victims. The co-defendant committed suicide prior to trial. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death. In affirming, the court determined that the decision whether or not to conduct a sequestered voir dire was within the discretion of the trial court. The court rejected defendant's argument that the jury did not reflect a fair cross-section of the community under the Sixth Amendment since the jury was not required to mirror the community. Further, defendant's Batson challenge failed because the State gave race-neutral reasons for using its peremptory challenges. Defendant's statement was admissible, despite the fact that his religion was used by police, because it was only mentioned after defendant had partially confessed. Further, the evidence showed that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent. Even if the prosecution failed to disclose expert testimony under Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; County Ct. Prac. R. 9.04, the evidence of blunt force trauma was merely cumulative. Finally, the imposition of the death penalty under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101 (Rev. 2000) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) appealed from an order entered by the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, reversing the order of the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS Board) which denied appellee employee's claim for disability benefits. The employee then appealed to the circuit court and was granted relief. PERS appealed, and the employee cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was a teacher for over 27 years before she ended her career. The question was whether her claim met the statutory requirements for the receipt of disability benefits. The circuit court reversed the PERS Board's decision denying benefits, determining that it was not supported by substantial evidence. However, on appeal, the court held that the PERS Board's decision was supported by substantial evidence, was not arbitrary and capricious, was made within the PERS Board's scope or power, and did not violate the employee's constitutional rights. The employee failed to meet her burden of proving she was in fact disabled. Though she might have needed her surgery, she was clearly able but unwilling to return to her job. The record clearly supported the PERS Board's order, which took into consideration all of the medical evidence, which did not establish that the employee's ailments were disabling. She was capable of performing her work duties from a medical standpoint; therefore, she was not entitled to disability benefits from the State of Mississippi. The trial court impermissibly reweighed the evidence and substituted its judgment for that of the administrative agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the circuit court was reversed on direct appeal and judgment was rendered reinstating the denial of disability benefits by the PERS Board. The judgment was affirmed on cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court agreed. All claims for the wrongful death of a person had to be litigated in the same suit and in the same court. Because appellee engaged counsel and filed a wrongful death suit without participation of the personal representative or appellants, she did so as the representative of all statutory beneficiaries and must, within a reasonable time following the filing of the complaint, provide reasonable notice to all other wrongful death beneficiaries, to the personal representative of the decedent, if one has been appointed, and to each person who bore a relationship to the deceased specified in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-7-13. Because appellee's attorney filed the first suit on behalf of all wrongful death beneficiaries, all such beneficiaries should have received notice of the litigation. Because there was no conflict of interest between appellee and the estate, and as the estate, through appellee as administratrix, employed a law firm to represent the estate, that firm should have represented the estate also.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church appealed the trial court's ruling and argued that a levy of execution upon a chose of action was not authorized by Mississippi law. Further, the church argued to the trial court that a writ of execution based on a judgment lien may only be applied to the proceeds of a lawsuit and not the lawsuit itself. The appellate court affirmed the denial of the church's motion to quash the writs of execution. The appellate court held that a reasonable interpretation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-7-7 (Rev. 2004) was that a chose in action could be transferred to the same extent as other property and therefore treated the same as other property. The appellate court noted that the Legislature did not choose to limit &sect; 11-7-7. Accordingly, save any statutory exceptions, there was no limitation on the execution of a chose in action. Further, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 13-3-135 implicitly authorized that a chose in action could be sold under writ of execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a mayor and city board of aldermen (the City), sought reversal of the Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi) allowing appellee property owners to keep a tree house in their front yard, claiming that the tree house violated Clinton, Miss., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 401.05, which was in force at the time the owners began construction of the tree house.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">According to the owners, the City's building inspector and zoning official approved the project and indicated that no permit was required. The court noted that the ordinance, as it applied to front yards, prohibited &quot;accessory buildings&quot; and prohibited &quot;uses.&quot; However, the definition within the ordinance was of an &quot;accessory structure or use,&quot; which was defined as a detached structure. The City provided no notice to the public that it utilized the definition of &quot;accessory structure or use&quot; to define &quot;accessory building or use.&quot; The court held that the &sect; 401.05 of the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and that the application of the definition of &quot;use&quot; to &sect; 401.05 was unconstitutionally vague. Further, the doctrine of laches applied and also equitable estoppel, because the City sat by in silence while the owners invested thousands of dollars in reliance on the approval while the treehouse was being built over a five-year period. Finally, the court found that the City violated Clinton, Miss., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 2411.03, which stated, that only in case of a tie vote could an application be forwarded to the mayor and aldermen board without recommendation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action involved an insurance dispute between the insurer and insured, a school district, with the central issue bearing on coverage and the applicability of an exclusionary clause. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer and claims adjuster, and the court affirmed. Because the insured's failure to comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 201 et seq., in a manner that exposed it to liability for overtime compensation was neither a &quot;wrongful act&quot; nor a &quot;wrongful employment act&quot; within the meaning of the school board policy, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the insurer and claims adjuster. Further, Exclusion 12 of the school board policy specifically excluded claims brought against the insured regarding back wages, overtime, or future wages. The exclusion was clear and unambiguous and was therefore enforced according to its terms. A thorough review of the record revealed no evidence of bad faith by the insurer and claims adjuster in denying the insured's request for coverage. Therefore, the trial court's grant of summary judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

He also asserted the death penalty in his case constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence established that petitioner accosted a 79-year-old woman and later raped and murdered her. Petitioner asserted counsel failed to properly argue a motion for change of venue. However, counsel had submitted a motion and affidavits alleging defendant could not receive a fair trial in the county because defendant was black and the victim was white. On direct appeal, the instant court had found the motion was properly denied. As with several issues petitioner raised, the matter was barred from further review. The instant court also held: (1) petitioner failed to establish a prima facie case of systematic exclusion under the standard set out in Lanier and same prevented him from demonstrating that his trial counsel's performance was deficient under the first prong of the Strickland standard; (2) counsel did, in fact, present a case in mitigation for the jury to consider and he was given a mental assessment showing that he was not as mentally retarded, thus, counsel was not ineffective at the sentencing phase, and (3) the jury instructions given at the sentencing phase, in accordance with Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101(7), did not violate petitioner's Eighth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that there was no evidence to suggest that defendant was mentally retarded. The appellate court previously held that it was reasonable to conclude that there was sufficient evidence that the murder was committed in an effort to avoid lawful arrest. The issue was procedurally barred from further consideration on collateral review by the doctrine of res judicata. Defendant's allegations as to a motion for a change of venue, failure to secure a speedy trial, and demand for jury questionnaires were without merit. Defendant was not entitled to formal notice in the indictment of the aggravating circumstances to be employed by the prosecution, and an indictment for capital murder put defendant on notice that the statutory aggravating factors would be used against him. The appellate court previously considered and rejected the issue of police trespass and whether the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the lesser-included offense of manslaughter. Defendant's other issues were without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The DeSoto County Circuit Court (Mississippi) convicted defendant of possession of two or more precursor chemicals (pseudoephedrine and lithium), knowing that the precursor chemicals would be used to unlawfully manufacture a controlled substance (methamphetamine), pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-313(1)(a)(ii) (Supp. 2003). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The store where defendant purchased the material called the police. Defendant's argument that an ordinary person buying a box of decongestant would not know they were committing a crime failed. Under mens rea, defendant must have known or should have reasonably have known that the decongestant would be used in the manufacture of a controlled substance. Defendant claimed probable cause and/or reasonable suspicion did not exist because the first officer on the scene began following his truck before he was able to determine that defendant's appearance matched that of the description given. Probable cause was not needed to watch the truck because of defective brake lights, follow the vehicle after matching defendant's description with that given by a store employee, and make an investigatory stop. All that was needed for these activities was reasonable suspicion. Because defendant's truck violated Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-7-13(3), and a traffic violation had occurred, stopping the truck was reasonable. Because the investigatory stop was based on a reasonable suspicion, after the ephedrine was seen in plain view, the officers had probable cause to search the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the prisoner's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Although counsel failed to move for a change of venue, each of the impaneled jury members affirmatively stated that they could serve as fair and impartial jurors. The record also revealed overwhelming evidence of the prisoner's guilt. Because defense counsel acted in accord with the prisoner's specific instructions not to present mitigation evidence, their performance was not deficient. The prisoner's actions overwhelmingly showed that he evinced a reckless indifference to the victim's killing because he was an aggressor and willfully imposed great danger upon the victim. His involvement in the crime was sufficient to justify the death sentence. The proof in the record did not support the prisoner's claim of being mentally retarded as to require remand to the trial court for an Atkins hearing. The prisoner supported his claim with copies of school records and affidavits of family members, none of which were sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to manslaughter in the Pike County Circuit Court, Mississippi. Defendant was sentenced to 20 years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. He was also ordered to pay a $ 10,000 assessment into the crime victims' compensation fund. Defendant moved for post-conviction relief, asserting that his plea was involuntary, that his plea counsel was ineffective, and that his sentence was excessive. His motion was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based on a review of the plea colloquy, it was clear that defendant understood the consequences of his guilty plea and understood the maximum penalty. It was also clear that he was competent and that his plea was voluntarily and intelligently made. Furthermore, defendant had expressed satisfaction with his attorney's representation. Thus, defendant's arguments that his plea was involuntary and that he was denied effective assistance were rejected. However, under the general manslaughter penalty statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-25 (Rev. 2000), defendant could have been fined &quot;or&quot; he could have been sentenced to 20 years in the penitentiary, but not both. However, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-32(1) provided that offenses punishable by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for more than one year and for which no fine was provided elsewhere by statute, could be punishable by a fine not in excess of $ 10,000. Thus, while the fine provision of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-25 (Rev. 2000) was not applicable, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-32(1) was applicable and it allowed for the trial court's imposition of the subject fine. The $ 10,000 assessment to the crime victims' compensation fund was also proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was affirmed. However, as to the amount defendant was assessed for the crime victims' compensation fund, because there was a discrepancy between the amount reflected in the transcript and the subsequent sentencing order, the matter was remanded for the limited purpose of clarifying that amount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, mother and child, sued defendant medical center for injuries the child sustained during a medical procedure. The Hinds County Circuit Court, Mississippi, denied the medical center's summary judgment motion and held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11(4) (Rev. 2002) tolled the minor's claim. The medical center appealed and alleged the 2002 amendment to &sect; 11-46-11(4) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child was burned during a surgical procedure in 1995. The mother had retained an attorney by 1996, but no action was filed until January 2002 which was well past the one-year statute of limitations in the Mississippi Tort Claims Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11 (Rev. 2002). The mother claimed that the March 2002 amendment to &sect; 11-46-11(4) allowed the claim to be filed pursuant to the minor's savings clause. The appellate court noted that under Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 97, the legislature could not enact any legislation that would revive a claim that had previously been barred by a statute of limitations. Under the 2002 amendment to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11(4), the legislature held that any claim from April 1, 1993 on was subject to a savings clause that tolled the claim until the minor was 21. As the amendment revived the minor's claim that had been barred by the statute of limitations, the 2002 amendment to &sect; 11-46-11(4) was unconstitutional to the extent that it makes the savings clause applicable to all claims since April 1, 1993. The state supreme court did hold that the 2000 amendment to &sect; 11-46-11(4), that enacted a savings clause in April 2000 was valid and enforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The denial of the medical center's summary judgment was reversed, and judgment was rendered in favor of the medical center. Plaintiffs' complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant judge appealed a decision by the Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance that ordered that the judge be publicly reprimanded, and that his temporary suspension be rescinded and he be reinstated to office. The judge was also ordered to pay the costs of the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judge was a county court judge and was appointed to office in August 2001 and later elected to a full term. The judge admitted that between October 2001 and January 2002, he filed on behalf of clients, five complaints in chancery courts, one complaint in circuit court, and two petitions in bankruptcy court. The commission filed a complaint against the judge in January 2003 and alleged the judge had continued to practice law after his appointment to the bench, thereby violating Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 9-1-25 and 9-9-9, as well as Miss. Code Jud. Conduct Canons 1, 2A, 2B, 3A and 4G. The judge claimed that he had relied on the language of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 9-9-9, and claimed the term &quot;pending cases&quot; was not limited to cases pending in court. The state supreme court agreed that the term &quot;pending cases&quot; was somewhat ambiguous, but that filing new actions in no way constituted concluding cases actually pending. However, the court also noted that as the judge did not wilfully abuse the privilege of filing new complaints while in office, the court adopted the commission's recommendation that the judge be publicly reprimanded and that he be reinstated after his temporary suspension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance recommended that appellee judge be sanctioned for extra-judicial public statements of his views on the rights of gays and lesbians. The issue was whether the judge's right to send a letter to the editor of his local weekly newspaper and to make statements over a telephone to a reporter from a radio network were protected by U.S. Const. amend. I and Miss. Const. art. III, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court pointed out that the letter pre-dated Miss. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 4(A)(1) and could not have been subject to it. Only Miss. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 2(A) could apply to the letter. Gay rights was a political/public issue, and, in the absence of a compelling state interest, no sanction could have been imposed. The court also concluded that the judge's statements were protected religious speech. Canon 2(A) constituted a prior restraint on the judge's right to publicly state his political and religious views, and the Commission had not met its burden of showing a compelling governmental interest. Because the court was convinced that the statements made by the judge constituted religious and political/public issue speech specially protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, and because the court was further persuaded that in some cases, including the case sub judice, forced concealment of views on political/public issues served to further no compelling governmental, public, or judicial interest, the court was compelled to reject the recommendation of the Commission. The court held that, under the particular facts of the case, sanctions were constitutionally impermissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the Commission's complaint and the case with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought leave to file a petition for post-conviction relief from a judgment of the Chickasaw County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of capital murder for kidnapping and murder and sentenced him to death. Defendant claimed that he was entitled to relief based on cumulative errors, and his indictment was unconstitutional because it failed to specify the aggravating factors used to sentence him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that he was entitled to relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the withholding of exculpatory evidence, his mental retardation, improper sentencing instructions, and the indictment failed to state the aggravating circumstances. The court found that there was substantial evidence to support the sentence based on the aggravating factors, including the fact that the murder was committed during the course of a kidnapping, and defendant was a habitual offender. The court rejected defendant's claims of ineffective counsel, finding he failed to show how his counsel's performance and strategy deprived him of a fair trial, and many of the issues were procedurally barred under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21 (2000) as they were or should have been raised on direct appeal. The court rejected defendant's claim that the aggravating factors elevating the charge to a capital offense must have been included in the indictment. The United States Supreme Court had not found that state capital defendants had a constitutional right to have all aggravating circumstances listed in their indictments. The court noted that the indictment did include the aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief, as well as a supplement/amendment to that petition. Defendant had been convicted of capital murder during the commission of a burglary, and he was sentenced to death. The conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant admitted that he was at the scene of the crime and that he killed the victim. After his conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal, he sought post-conviction relief. The court allowed defendant to supplement his petition, which asserted six additional grounds for relief beyond the initial six from the original petition. The court initially determined that issues relating to suppression of his confession had been previously litigated and were barred by res judicata and by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21(3). His counsel was not ineffective in failing to present mitigating evidence, as such was pursuant to defendant's explicit instructions that he preferred the death penalty over life imprisonment. Defense counsel's performance with respect to a change of venue, testing of DNA samples, and a continuance was not deficient. Defendant's sentence was neither disproportionate nor unconstitutional, and the jury's verdict was proper. The aggravating factors were supportive of the jury's verdict, the death sentence was to be carried out upon exhaustion of appeals, regardless of other sentences, and cumulative errors did not require reversal due to cumulative prejudicial effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the petition.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The trial court did not err by denying strikes for cause on the jurors. The prospective jurors all stated that they could follow the law and weigh the evidence and mitigating and aggravating factors before making a determination of whether defendant should receive the death penalty. The record was full of questions from the trial court, the State, and the defense concerning the death penalty. The four jurors in question also appeared in the trial judge's chambers and were questioned more extensively by the trial court, prosecution and defense. The record reflected that the defense individually questioned each of the four jurors in chambers. The trial judge placed no restrictions on the attorneys' questions in chambers. Lastly, none of the jurors ever sat on the final impaneled jury, and thus, never even voted on the issue of defendant's guilt or whether he should receive a death or life sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant made a statement to police that he and co-defendant discussed robbing the victim. Later, at the victim's home, they struck her in the head outside her home, defendant held her down so that he could get money out of her pockets, and then they searched her house for more money. They left with about $ 200 and a pistol. The appellate court found that defendant had not made a prima facie showing that he was mentally retarded; therefore, the State was not prohibited by the Eighth Amendment from executing him. Additionally, the appellate court found that defense counsel did not render ineffective assistance during either the punishment or guilt phase of defendant's trial. Furthermore, the jury instructions were appropriate, as they were in accordance with Mississippi law and they fairly and adequately instructed the jury. In addition, the evidence included the testimony of the witnesses who saw defendant and co-defendant together throughout the evening, the blood evidence, the items found at co-defendant's home, and defendant's confession. Thus, reasonable, fair-minded jurors could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of robbery and capital murder.</SPAN></P>

He currently filed a petition for post-conviction relief in the supreme court and the supreme court denied the petition. The inmate argued that he was denied due process pursuant to Miss.

The supreme court stated that the issue was procedurally barred from being raised for the first time in his petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21(1). However, his contention was also without merit because the record indicated that the inmate affirmed the juror's presence after fully exploring her abilities to read, write, and comprehend English. He was also not denied any constitutional or fundamental rights by the admission of the testimony of the victim's children because their testimony corroborated portions of the victim's husband's testimony.

The court had previously remanded the post-conviction proceedings to the trial court for the appointment of qualified counsel to represent the inmate, and counsel filed the documents at issue presently before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. He raised various issues in his application for post-conviction relief. The court found most the issues to be without merit. In addition, the court noted that several of the inmate's issues had been raised on direct appeal and had been found to be without merit, and thus those issues were procedurally barred under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21(2). The court rejected the inmate's numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found no error in the attorneys' failure to object to the inmate being shackled at trial because no juror had stated that the shacking affected the conviction. The attorneys were not required to object to sentencing instructions that were proper, nor were the attorneys ineffective for failing to object to the exclusion of certain jurors, given that they did not meet the qualifications of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 13-5-1 (Rev. 2002). The court did find, however, that it could not, given recent case law, constitutionally deny the inmate an opportunity to present the issue of his possible mental retardation to the trial court. Thus, the inmate's motion for relief was granted to this extent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the inmate leave to proceed in the trial court on the sole issue of his alleged mental retardation. All other claims in his petition for post-conviction relief were denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant murdered his ex-wife, her two parents, and his three-year-old daughter. He was indicted on four counts of capital murder. Count one was for the willful murder of his daughter while engaged in the commission of the crime of felonious abuse and/or battery of the child, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-5-39 (Rev. 2000). The remaining counts were the willful murder while engaged in the commission of the crime of robbery. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. The supreme court affirmed, stating that the trial court did not err in denying his motion to sever count one of the indictment, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-7-1 (Rev. 2000). The killings occurred within a few hours and were all part of the common scheme to rob his ex-father-in-law and eliminate any witnesses. Additionally, the murders were interwoven, and all of the murders occurred at the same place and closely in time. Further, defendant testified at trial that he killed his child because she could identify him. Although the State struck substantially more women than men, the fact that the selected jury incorporated a proportionally larger percentage of women than were in the venire contradicted his claim of gender discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Governor approved two sections of a bill that addressed funding for prisons. The Governor vetoed the third section of the bill. Consequently, the prison filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the Mississippi Department of Corrections and the Governor from closing its facility. The trial court found that the partial veto violated Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 73. The trial court held that the bill was a valid law in its entirety. On appeal, the court found that the third section of the bill was but a condition of the first two sections, which appropriated the funds by the Mississippi Legislature. The language of the bill made the third section reliant upon the first two sections. The Governor's veto could not inhibit the legislative intent of the bill, nor could his veto create new legislation. The court held that the Governor's partial veto of the bill was an unconstitutional veto of a condition of an appropriation bill as written and was a nullity. The trial court properly found that the veto was a nullity and that the bill became law in its entirety in the form passed by the Mississippi Legislature.</SPAN></P>

After the sentence was affirmed on review, the inmate filed a petition for leave to file for post-conviction relief. In denying the application, the court determined that the inmate was unable to show that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant failed to show that another expert would have disputed the finding of the State's expert. Further, defense counsel objected to the admission of photographs and the admission of a pathologist's testimony. In addition, the inmate failed to show how other medical records would have persuaded a jury to exercise leniency during sentencing. The court noted that many of the inmate's claims were procedurally barred from collateral review under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21(3) because they had been previously litigated. Finally, the court determined that the State was not required to list the aggravating factors in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On writ of certiorari, plaintiff, a former state employee, sought review of a decision from the Court of Appeals (Mississippi), which reversed the trial court's judgment in the employee's favor in a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against defendants, state agencies and individual state employees, for retaliatory termination arising from the exercise of his First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, right to speak out on matters of public concern.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee, who worked at a state hospital, wrote a letter critical of abusive practices and sent it to a state official who was the superior of the hospital's director. The employee's immediate supervisor was highly critical of the employee for having gone over the heads of his immediate superiors. Four days later, the employee was fired. Because he was a probationary employee, his administrative appeal was dismissed. The employee failed to appeal the dismissal order and instead brought suit, alleging retaliation for the exercise of his freedom of speech and wrongful termination. A jury found in his favor, but the court of appeals ruled that the grievance procedure was his exclusive remedy. The court reversed the appellate decision, holding that a retaliatory discharge claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 could be brought against state officials in their personal or individual capacities. The complaint sufficiently identified, as required by Miss. R. Civ. P. 9(a), the individuals against whom &sect; 1983 relief was sought. Qualified immunity did not apply because the employee's speech was on a matter of public concern. Substantial evidence supported the verdict in the employee's favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the federal civil rights judgment against the director individually but reversed and rendered as to all other defendants. The court affirmed the state law judgment against the agencies but reversed and rendered as to the director and his superior. The court affirmed the award of fees and costs, except as to the director's superior, and found no error in the trial court's refusal to submit the issue of punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim, an elderly woman, was beaten and fatally shot during a robbery committed by defendant, who was 17 years old, and his brother. The court found no error in the trial court's decision to strike a juror who was ambivalent as to whether she could impose the death penalty, while refusing to strike a juror who had attended church with the victim's sister. Disqualification of an illiterate juror under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 13-5-1 did not violate defendant's right to an impartial jury. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the alleged murder weapon into evidence and permitted a forensic expert to testify that the victim was shot with the same type of weapon. Photographs of the body were also relevant to establishing the type of weapon. Intent did not have to be proven under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(2)(e) because the murder occurred during a robbery. Sufficient evidence supported a finding of aggravating circumstances under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101(5). A death sentence for a minor was not cruel or unusual punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Despite the approval from the Gaming Commission, the Secretary of State denied the public trust tidelands lease and stated that the site did not satisfy the geographical requirements of the Mississippi Gaming Control Act of 1990, Miss.

On appeal, the court determined that the crucial issue was whether the Secretary of State had the final decision-making authority concerning a proposed public trust tidelands lease. The court held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 29-1-107(2) (2000) unequivocally afforded the Secretary of State the discretion to enter into a lease of the public tidelands and that the Secretary of State had the responsibility of preserving the public trust tidelands for the people of the State of Mississippi. The court affirmed the chancery court's judgment, finding that the Secretary of State's decision to deny the lease to the owners was made within the discretion granted to him.

Nevertheless, the supreme court determined that there was no independent fundamental right of access to purchase sexual devices. Other courts had compared the purchase of sexual devices to the right of access to contraceptives. The supreme court, however, concluded that society's interest in protecting the right to control conception was of greater magnitude than the interest in protecting the right to purchase sexual devices. The vendors next argued that the prohibition on the advertisement, sale, and distribution of sexual devices violated the constitutional right to free speech. The vendors did not question the state's constitutional power to regulate businesses that sell and/or distribute sexual devices. The supreme court determined that the prohibition on the sale and/or distribution of sexual devices constituted only an incidental restriction on the vendors alleged right to freedom of speech that was no greater than was essential to the furtherance of the State's governmental interests.</SPAN></P>

The Rankin County Circuit Court (Mississippi) granted summary judgment to the district under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (MTCA), Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-46-1 et seq., finding that the employee had not acted within the course and scope of his employment. The victim appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee, who worked as a security patrol officer with the district, arrested appellant for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol; during the course of the arrest, he hugged and kissed her without her consent. She argued that, as the employee's acts, though improper, were not criminal, the trial court erred by dismissing her claims against the district. The supreme court did not reach this argument, because it found that the employee's tortious acts were not done to further any purpose of his employer. As the employee had not been acting within the scope of his employment with the district when he hugged and kissed appellant, her claims against the district were barred by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-7. Appellant's failure to raise the issue of the constitutionality of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-13 (2002) of the MTCA before the trial court and to notify the Mississippi Attorney General of this pursuant to Miss. R. Civ. P. 24(d) resulted in a procedural bar on this issue.</SPAN></P>

He was also convicted of the rape and kidnapping of the victim's female companion. The supreme court previously affirmed defendant's convictions and he filed a motion for leave to proceed in the trial court with a petition for post-conviction relief. The court denied the motion, stating that the exclusion of the inmate's videotape showing remorse for his actions was proper because his current argument was barred by res judicata. Further, his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel was without merit because he offered no evidence that supported his claim that his trial counsel should have investigated more thoroughly or in certain areas. His death sentence was not disproportionate because the jury found that defendant intended the victim's death and contemplated that lethal force would be used. Ample evidence also showed that defendant actively planned and participated in the robbery and murder. His indictment was not unconstitutional for failure to include and specify the aggravating factors because there was no constitutional right to have the factors listed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city sought to annex certain property under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-1-27 (Rev. 2000). In order to annex the property in question, the city also had to annex a right-of-way in order to make it both adjacent and contiguous to the city limits. It filed a petition seeking approval of the annexation in the chancery court. However, without hearing any evidence regarding the annexation's reasonableness, a chancellor stated that the annexation could not have proceeded. After the petition was dismissed, the city sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the chancellor had the duty to determine the reasonableness of the city's proposal under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-1-33 (2001). The chancellor was required to conduct a full hearing allowing for evidence and testimony and utilizing the indicia of reasonableness factors to determine if the proposed annexation was allowed. The court noted that the annexation statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-1-27 (Rev. 2000), was not unconstitutionally vague because the reasonableness test was not included in the statute's language. Because a hearing was not conducted, a reversal of the case was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision of the chancery court was reversed. The case was remanded with instructions to proceed on the merits with a full hearing to determine whether the proposed annexation was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-35 (Rev. 2006), the trial court committed reversible error in giving a castle-doctrine jury instruction favoring the victim because a castle-doctrine instruction had never been given in regard to the victim being granted the mandatory rebuttable presumption in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-15(3) (Rev. 2014) that a person was entitled to use whatever force was necessary to meet or repel an attack from another person, and such an instruction was patently inappropriate as the statute clearly indicated that the rebuttable presumption was granted to a defendant, not the victim; and a reasonable juror could have interpreted the challenged instruction to create a presumption that lessened the State's burden of proof and required rebuttal evidence from defendant to overcome the presumption.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-The trial court's denial of defendant's request for a parole recommendation was not an appealable order. Therefore, the appellate court did not address the merits of the claim; [2]-Although defendant argued that his thirteen-and-a-half-year sentence for transfer of a controlled substance was illegal because it exceeded the new statutory maximum of eight years as set by recent amendments to the sentencing scheme found in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139(b)(1) (Supp. 2015), at the time of defendant's crime and sentencing, the statute provided for a penalty of up to thirty years for transfer of the controlled substance. Thus, defendant's thirteen-and-a-half-year sentence was well within the thirty years permitted by law and was not illegal.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 63-3-619 because an officer was able to articulate an objective basis for the stop by stating that defendant's vehicle was following another vehicle more closely than was reasonable and prudent; [4]-The tailgaiting statute was not unconstitutionally vague because gave notice of the prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">ISSUE: Whether defendant's guilty plea was involuntary because he was affirmatively misinformed by his counsel that he would be eligible for parole on two enhanced counts. HOLDINGS: [1]-To the extent defendant claimed that he would not be paroled on an interstate removal of a child charge, his claims were without merit. However, defendant's other two counts each carried an enhanced penalty so that he was not eligible for parole on those two sentences under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-3(1)(f) (Supp. 2014); [1]-Although affiants did not claim to have been present when counsel made representations to defendant, they alleged that counsel made the same representations to them. This was sufficient corroboration to create a fact issue to be resolved through an evidentiary hearing as to whether defendant was affirmatively misinformed of his eligibility for parole on the two enhanced counts.</SPAN></P>

Even if it were assumed that the police pursuit was unreasonable, it could not be said to be a superseding cause because it was not an independent intervening agency, but instead was a natural and foreseeable response to defendant's flight; [3]-Defendant was not entitled to a lesser-included offense instruction.</SPAN></P>

R. Evid. 803(4) was not applicable because the rule relates only to statements made to health-care providers by individuals seeking medical treatment, and the statements made by the family members were hearsay statements alleging what the physicians allegedly said about the patient's condition.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed. He offered no evidence that the firearm could not be readily converted to expel a projectile, and &sect; 97-37-5(1) did not require the State to prove that it was operable at the time of his arrest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court should have allowed defense counsel to cross-examine the witness regarding any favorable treatment she could have received with regard to the alleged prostitution.

The PCR court properly rejected his claim that his conviction of both charges violated the double jeopardy ban. As a conviction of PFCF required proof of a prior felony, while a conviction of CCW required proof the weapon was concealed, each offense had an element not present in the other; therefore, there was no double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by the Tate County Circuit Court, Mississippi, of burglary of a building other than a dwelling and grand larceny. The trial court found that he was a habitual offender and sentenced him to an effective term of 17 years with no possibility of parole, probation, or a reduction of his sentence. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During his interrogation, defendant asked for a public defender who had previously represented him. Counsel was located and joined defendant. The court found that under no circumstances should defendant have been prompted to sign a form waiving his Miranda right to counsel when he had already requested counsel and the requested lawyer was present in the room with him. Further, defendant had every reason to believe that counsel was acting as his attorney during the interrogation. Defendant's fragile mental condition also required the presence of a lawyer. Defendant did not voluntarily, knowingly, or intelligently waive his right to counsel. Thus, defendant's constitutional rights were violated during the interrogation, and the trial court committed reversible error by admitting a videotape of the interrogation into evidence. The court also found reversible error in the trial court's failure to address defendant's receipt of constitutionally defective assistance of counsel during his interrogation. As admission of the videotape into evidence forced defendant to give up his right to remain silent and testify in his own defense, his Fifth Amendment rights were again violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of selling cocaine. The DeSoto County Circuit Court, Mississippi, sentenced him to 60 years in confinement as a habitual offender under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-81 and as a subsequent offender under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-147. Defendant sought review, challenging the denial of his motion for a mistrial, the admission of a videotape into evidence, the chain of custody of the cocaine, and his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought a mistrial, claiming that the State, when conducting voir dire, improperly commented on his right to remain silent and not to testify. The court found no abuse of discretion in the denial of his motion as the prosecutor simply remarked that the defense was not required to put on any witnesses and did not speak to defendant's failure to testify. Defendant argued that the State failed to lay a sufficient evidentiary foundation to enter a videotape of the drug sale into evidence under Miss. R. Evid. 901(b)(1). The court concluded that the videotape was properly authenticated by two police officers who testified that the videotape accurately depicted the transaction as it occurred. Defendant presented no evidence or reasonable inference to support his claim that there was a break in the custody of the cocaine. Thus, he failed to overcome the presumption of regularity and the cocaine was properly admitted into evidence. The court concluded defendant's sentence complied with &sect;&sect; 99-19-81 and 41-29-147. Given the gravity of the instant offense and the nature of his prior offenses, his sentence did not give rise to an inference of gross disproportionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Certain real property was sold by tax sale to a bank. The bank sold the property to appellee purchaser. The purchaser filed an action to quiet title against appellant city. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The city claimed that the property had reverted to it by operation of law and that the tax sale was void. The Chancery Court of Hinds County, Mississippi, entered summary judgment for the purchaser. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city conveyed the property to a community development corporation (CDC) by quitclaim deed that contained a reverter clause as required by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-17-1(3)(a) (Rev. 2001 &amp; Supp. 2003). The CDC failed to pay property taxes. The city claimed that the CDC did not receive proper notice of the expiration of the right of redemption under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-43-1 (Rev. 2006). Thus, the tax sale was void. The court found that the city had standing to assert such a claim. However, the city's argument that its reversionary interest was sufficient to require notice of the expiration of the right of redemption under &sect; 27-43-1 was dispositive of the appeal. The court construed &sect; 27-43-1's reference to &quot;record owner&quot; to include a holder of a reversionary interest. As the reverter language was on the face of the quitclaim deed to the CDC, the city's reversionary interest in the property was reasonably ascertainable, and it was entitled to receive statutory notice of the expiration of the redemption period from the chancery court clerk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed summary judgment for the purchaser and rendered summary judgment for the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a decision from appellee Mississippi State Tax Commission, which assessed a fee against it as a commercial solid waste disposal site. The Hinds County Chancery Court, Mississippi, ruled that the taxpayer could not proceed with its appeal as an indigent party and was required to post the proper bond. The chancery court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After filing its appeal with the chancery court, the taxpayer filed a motion for supersedeas that requested the chancery court enter an order allowing it to proceed without posting a bond as required and to prevent any collection proceedings against it during the pendency of the case. The taxpayer attached a pauper's affidavit that asserted it did not have the money to pay the required bond or assessment. The court found that the language of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-7-7 (Rev. 2005) was clear. To appeal to the chancery court, the taxpayer was required to post a bond or pay the amount of the tax under protest. By doing neither, the chancery court did not err in dismissing the case. The taxpayer was not entitled to proceed in forma pauperis on an appeal from the Commission to the chancery court. The taxpayer argued that &sect; 27-7-7 violated its due process rights. However, that matter was not before the chancery court nor did it notify the Attorney General of its constitutional challenge as required by Miss. R. Civ. P. 24(d) and Miss. R. App. P. 44(a), which resulted in a procedural bar to the court's review of that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate filed a fifth request for postconviction relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for postconviction relief, because his indictment failed to state the essential elements of the crime of murder. While the issue was not raised within the three-year limitations period in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2) or fall within any of the recognized exceptions, the issue was reviewable because it infringed upon the inmate's right to due process, which right was not waivable and was excepted from the procedural bars of the Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act. As for the merits of the claim, the appellate court concluded that the indictment was legally sufficient. While defendant claimed that the indictment should have included the phrase &quot;not in necessary self-defense,&quot; the indictment's inclusion of the word &quot;unlawfully&quot; rendered the indictment legally sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate challenged a judgment of the Forrest County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which denied his motion to mandate parole eligibility on his life sentence pursuant to the Mississippi Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals held that the trial court lacked the jurisdiction necessary to consider the inmate's motion under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-5-803(2) (Rev. 2004). The inmate did not exhaust his administrative remedies. The trial court erroneously treated the inmate's motion as if it were a motion for post-conviction relief. However, the inmate's request did not complain about the validity of any of his convictions, of the sentences received, or that he was unlawfully incarcerated, which were some of the grounds for relief permitted under a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to the Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(1)(a) - (i) (Supp. 2008). The inmate's motion simply argued that the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) had incorrectly classified him as &quot;parole ineligible.&quot; A motion for post-conviction relief was not the correct procedural vehicle for such an argument. The MDOC had determined that the inmate was ineligible for parole consideration by the parole board. The record was completely bare as to any proof that the inmate ever exhausted his administrative remedies or even voiced his grievance through the MDOC's administrative-review procedure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals reversed the judgment and dismissed the inmate's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

TRIAL COURT DISPOSITION: CONVICTED OF FELONY EXPLOITATION OF A VULNERABLE ADULT AND SENTENCED TO FOUR YEARS IN THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, WITH FOUR YEARS SUSPENDED, AND TO PAY $ 4,120 IN RESTITUTION AND A $ 250 FINE.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of exploitation of a vulnerable adult by the Circuit Court of Clay County, Mississippi. The trial court gave her a 4-year suspended sentence, ordered her to pay a fine and court costs, and to pay restitution. Defendant filed a motion for a directed verdict, or, in the alternative, a motion for a new trial, which was denied. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused in the indictment of using $ 4,120 of her mother's money without her mother's consent at the time her mother was a vulnerable adult. However, the jury instruction stated that she could be found guilty if she exploited her mother by using her resources with or without her mother's consent. The court found that defendant was correct that the jury instruction failed to follow the language of the indictment, but it did follow the definition of exploitation set out in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-47-5(i) (2009). The testimony implied that defendant used the money for her son's benefit with her mother's consent. However, the statute made it clear that any improper use of a vulnerable adult's resources for another's advantage was exploitation. Consent was a non-issue as the State did not have to prove consent. Defendant argued that the &sect; 43-47-5(i) was unconstitutional vague as there was no explanation of the terms &quot;illegal&quot; or &quot;improper,&quot; which made it impossible to determine if a financial transaction was improper. The court found that under the language of the statute, her actions constituted exploitation. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate filed suit against appellee State, seeking an interpretation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 47-7-3 and 47-7-5 (Supp. 2009) and claiming that they were unconstitutional. He moved for a preliminary injunction, alleging that the Mississippi State Parole Board violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights by arbitrarily denying him parole. He challenged a judgment of the Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which dismissed his complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals held that the inmate's concerns failed to state a constitutional claim sufficient for the trial court to assert jurisdiction. Because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the inmate's claims, it did not err by dismissing his complaint. The Parole Board was in compliance with Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-5, which provided that the Parole Board had to be composed of five members. The trial court did not err by denying the inmate's motion for a preliminary injunction. Nothing in the record supported the inmate's claim that the Parole Board arbitrarily denied him parole in violation of any Fourteenth Amendment right. The Parole Board denied the inmate's parole based upon the serious nature of the offense, the number of offenses committed, the inmate's police record, community opposition, and insufficient time served. The reasons stated by the Parole Board for denying the inmate's parole were areas that the Parole Board had authority to consider under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-17 (Rev. 2004). Therefore, those categories could not be viewed as arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of possession of a dirk knife by a convicted felon in violation of Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that &sect; 97-37-5 was unconstitutionally vague as it provided insufficient notice of the contemplated conduct it prohibited. The court disagreed, finding that it specifically prohibited felons from possessing dirk knives. Thus, defendant failed to overcome the statute's presumption of validity. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion JNOV because the State offered insufficient evidence to prove that the knife he was in possession of was a dirk knife. The court observed that the legislature had never defined the term &quot;dirk knife.&quot; In examining the traditional and modern views of the definition of a dirk knife from other jurisdictions, the court concluded that to qualify as a dirk knife for purposes of &sect; 97-37-5, a weapon had to have a blade with at least one sharpened edge that tapered to a point and had to be designed for use primarily as a stabbing weapon. The court concluded that the evidence failed to show that the knife in defendant's possession at the time of his arrest was a dirk knife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued the circuit court erred in addressing his petitions to show cause and clarify his sentence under the Mississippi Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act. The court of appeals held that the inmate's petitions to clarify and show cause had to be handled initially under administrative-review procedures, rather than in the courts, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-5-803 (Rev. 2004). Since there was no indication in the record that the inmate exhausted his administrative remedies on those claims, the court of appeals are without jurisdiction to consider them. The inmate argued that his parole was unlawfully revoked. The inmate's due-process rights were not violated when his parole was revoked. Upon receiving a certified copy of the order of the court of appeals, the parole board had authority pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. 47-7-27 to immediately revoke the inmate's parole on his earlier conviction. A preliminary revocation hearing and a parole-revocation hearing were held. The parole board then sent the inmate a letter, which provided notice of its decision to revoke his parole and afforded an opportunity to present evidence on his behalf.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Approximately 13 years after his conviction for the sale of crack cocaine, defendant filed a petition to show cause complaining that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly construed his petition as one for post-conviction relief or a claim based upon a deprivation of his civil rights. Defendant argued that the Mississippi Legislature had failed to adequately fund the public defender's office. He asserted that if the trial court found that he demonstrated error due to funding an resource deficiencies, reversal of his conviction was required unless the State demonstrated that the error was harmless. However, defendant's petition was clearly one for post-conviction relief pusuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(1). Because his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, defendant was obligated under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-7 (Supp. 2009) to receive leave from the Mississippi Supreme Court before he filed his petition for post-conviction relief. Having failed to do so, the petition was procedurally barred. Further, defendant improperly filed his petition in the wrong circuit and the petition was untimely pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2) (2007).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In Jones County Circuit Court (Mississippi), appellant was indicted for possession of 11.59 grams of cocaine with the intent to distribute pursuant to Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The assignments of error included: the circuit court and defense counsel failed to advise him of his right to appeal his sentence; the sentence imposed constituted an unconstitutional, illegal sentence; he was denied effective assistance of counsel; and his guilty plea was not voluntarily and intelligently entered. Appellant's arguments failed. The circuit court erred in determining  it lacked jurisdiction to review appellant's motion for postconviction relief. Even if appellant's counsel failed to advise him of his right to appeal his sentence, appellant did not allege that he would have appealed his illegally lenient sentence. Any such claim would have been viewed with skepticism, as it was not in appellant's interest to appeal the sentence until four months later when his intensive supervision program status was revoked. The circuit judge carefully questioned appellant about his ability to understand the charges against him, the repercussions of his guilty plea, and his willingness to enter into the plea arrangement. The circuit court found appellant's decision was freely, voluntarily, and intelligently made and accepted his plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the circuit court denying the motion for postconviction relief was affirmed. All costs of the appeal were assessed to the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pro se appellant state inmate sought judicial review of the decision by the Tate County Circuit Court (Mississippi) to his dismiss his petition for post-conviction relief. The inmate asserted five claims of error. The inmate pled guilty to three counts of selling morphine and was sentenced to nineteen years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections with ten years suspended and nine years to serve.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the inmate alleged that his trial court was ineffective for failing to address the issues of jurisdiction, the inmate's mental condition, severance, and other issues, the inmate offered no evidence that his counsel was ineffective. He also took issue with the trial court's accepting his guilty plea. He contended that there was no evidence that he had committed the crime of the sale of morphine; therefore, no factual basis existed for his guilty pleas. However, the inmate stated under oath that he was not coerced into entering his guilty pleas and that he understood what he was pleading to. The inmate contended that his constitutional rights had been violated, resulting in his guilty pleas. He argued that he was innocent and that in light of his mental condition, but he offered no medical evidence that he was incompetent to stand trial. The inmate took issue with the trial court's refusal to grant him an evidentiary hearing, but he offered no proof of error by the trial court on that issue. That issue was procedurally barred since he had not complied with Miss. R. App. P. 28(a)(6). Defendant's sentence was not excessive. The sentence was within the jurisdictional limits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pro se appellant inmate appealed the decision by the Marshall County Circuit Court (Mississippi) denying his second petition for post-conviction relief (PCR). He had pled guilty to violating Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(1)(a) (Rev. 2001). He asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, his life sentence was excessive and unconstitutional, and other procedural errors, not raised before the trial court, merited reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The only such exception that the inmate alleged allowed him to file a successive writ was the existence of an intervening decision. With regard solely to his proposed unconstitutional sentence, he argued that the Apprendi decision and the Blakely decision satisfied the intervening-decision exception. His argument was essentially that his sentence of life was unconstitutional because the trial court and not a jury decided his punishment. However, neither decision provided any support for his claim. Since the trial court imposed a sentence within the statutory limitations provided by the Mississippi Legislature, the inmate's sentence was appropriate, and there was no error. In addition to the procedural bar against a successive writ, the inmate's current petition, had it been his first plea for review, would nonetheless still be barred by the three-year statute of limitations in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2) (Supp. 2009). He had pled guilty on March 1, 2001. His current petition for PCR was filed on October 1, 2008, well past the time limit granted to file for relief under the Mississippi Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Rankin County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of aggravated assault on law enforcement officers (Counts I and II), possession of a stolen firearm (Count III), and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon (Count IV). He was sentenced to 30 years for Counts I and II, 5 years for Count III, and 3 years for Count IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his convictions and sentence and the appellate court reversed in part. Defendant was erroneously sentenced under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-37-37(2) (Supp. 2009), which was not in effect at the time his crime was committed. He should have been sentenced pursuant to section 97-37-37(1) (Supp. 2009), which became effective on July 1, 2004. Section 97-37-37(1) required a sentence enhancement of five years for each count of aggravated assault because defendant used a firearm during the commission of the felonies. The sentence enhancement under Counts I and II was vacated, and the case was remanded. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed. The heading of defendant's indictment stated that he was being charged with aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer and the counts stated the statute under which he was charged; thus, it was clear from the indictment that defendant injured the two police officers with a deadly weapon. His conviction under Count III was proper because an informant testified that he gave defendant a pistol in exchange for crack cocaine and that defendant knew that the pistol was stolen.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sentence enhancement under Counts I and II was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing pursuant to the law in effect at the time of defendant's crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of possession of marijuana; however, a mistrial was declared on a possession of cocaine charge as the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Subsequently, appellant was convicted by a jury in the Newton County Circuit Court (Mississippi) on a count of felony possession of cocaine and sentenced to eight years. It was from the second conviction that appellant raised four issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant argued that: the circuit court erred in sentencing her to the maximum allowable sentence; the circuit court erred in refusing to give a jury instruction which allegedly articulated appellant's theory of the case; the circuit court erred in admitting evidence of other crimes; and the search of the truck appellant was driving was unreasonable under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The arguments failed. Although appellant claimed she was a first-time offender, she was previously charged three times for driving under the influence and she was addicted to marijuana and alcohol. As the marijuana and the cocaine were in the same container within appellant's purse, the discovery of the marijuana led to the deputy's discovery of the cocaine at issue in the second trial. Further, appellant's admission that the marijuana was hers demonstrated that it was more likely that the cocaine was also hers. The checkpoint was set up in daylight, on a straight thoroughfare, and there was a definitive plan established by the officers for checking vehicles. Any minor deviation from the departmental policy was reasonable under the circumstances and did not violate appellant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate sought judicial review of an order by the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County (Mississippi) dismissing his motion for post-conviction relief (PCR). The inmate requested that his right to file a meaningful PCR motion be reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate did not argue that the circuit court was in error in dismissing that motion, and he did not request time to file an out-of-time appeal from the motion's denial. Instead, he requested that he be allowed to file another PCR motion. It was his argument that his attorney's ineffective representation deprived him of the chance to file a meaningful PCR motion. The PCR motion that was filed and dismissed was lacking any affidavits or evidence in support of its claims. Therefore, the circuit court properly dismissed the motion. The circuit court did not err in refusing to set aside the dismissal of his PCR motion. None of the exceptions for filing a successive PCR motion applied to the inmate. One of the inmate's main arguments was that his fundamental constitutional rights were implicated because of his trial counsel's ineffective representation. That claim would not be addressed since the inmate had an out-of-time direct appeal before the present court raising some of the same issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Lowndes County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of felony child abuse in violation of Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for felony child abuse, but the appellate court affirmed. There was no question that defendant's attorney was engaged in the practice of law during his representation of defendant and the attorney's recent status change to inactive was harmless as it related to the jury verdict. Defendant failed to show prejudice because the attorney had been an inactive member for less than one month, which was clearly an insufficient period of time to claim that the attorney's continuing education was lacking. Additionally, defendant did not prove that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant failed to prove that the outcome of his trial was prejudiced by comments made by counsel, especially in light of the overwhelming weight of evidence against defendant, including defendant's own statement that he spanked and bit the child, coupled with eyewitness and medical testimony regarding the severity of the child's injuries. Medical testimony at trial further unequivocally proved that the victim's severe bruising was a temporary disfigurement of a bodily organ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a case brought under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (MTCA), appellant, the natural mother and adult next friend of a minor, sought judicial review of the decision by the Jones County Circuit Court (Mississippi) dismissing her medical negligence claim against defendant hospital without prejudice because she had not given the hospital 90 days' notice of the claim before filing the complaint. The mother alleged two claims on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that the MTCA violated (1) the Equal Protection Clause of the Seventh and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and (2) the anti-trust, unfair competition, and price fixing provisions of the Sherman Anti-trust Act. Neither of the mother's arguments were presented to the circuit court. Therefore, the appellate court could not address them on appeal. Although, in her motion to amend the complaint, the mother stated that she wished to raise the constitutionality of the MTCA, there was no valid complaint to amend. She also had not provided the required notice under Miss. R. Civ. P. 24(d) to the Mississippi Attorney General that she was going to challenge the constitutionality of the MTCA. It was clear that she resorted to those novel claims on appeal because there was no error on the part of the circuit court. While the mother had given the hospital notice as required by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11(1), she filed suit after only 85 days later, and the 90-day requirement in &sect; 11-46-11(1) was a hard-edged, mandatory rule which the courts strictly enforced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court's denial of defendant's amended motion for a new trial on August 2, 2007, determined the starting date for the purposes of determining whether the appeal was untimely filed. While the appeal was untimely, the appellate court would suspend the rules and review her out-of-time appeal on the merits. Defendant unsuccessfully argued that she should not have been charged as a habitual offender as the sentences for her two previous convictions were served concurrently. Her two prior felonies were separate incidents, which occurred at different times, and each carried a sentence of at least one year. The fact that she was only incarcerated for one year while serving her concurrent sentences did not afford her relief from habitual offender status under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-81 (Rev. 2000). Defendant argued unsuccessfully that her sentence was unconstitutional as it exceeded the maximum sentence allowed by law. As she was a habitual offender, the circuit court was required under &sect; 99-19-81 to impose the maximum sentence for grand larceny, which was ten years and a fine of $ 10,000. Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-17-41 (Supp. 2003).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a Pontotoc County Circuit Court (Mississippi) jury of possession of cocaine, in an amount greater than.10 gram but less than 2 grams, and sentenced as a habitual offender to life in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections without eligibility for parole or probation. Defendant appealed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant neither alleged jurisdictional defect in the indictment, nor did she identify any actual prejudice she suffered as a result of any non-jurisdictional defect, so her claim could not be raised for the first time in her appeal. Although the State subjected three witnesses to improper questioning, the circuit court properly instructed the jury to disregard the evidence; further, defense counsel made no request for a mistrial, indicating he did not believe the questioning resulted in irreparable prejudice. The admission of the codefendant's guilty plea did not constitute plain error. There was no error in the introduction of the evidence of cocaine in the house and no prejudice to defendant from the introduction of this evidence. The disparity in the codefendant's and defendant's sentencing, which was based on the State's amendment to the indictment, did not violate defendant's constitutional right to trial by jury. Defendant's sentence conformed to the requirements of the habitual offender statute and the circuit court considered defendant's sentence in light of the facts and her previous criminal history. Accordingly, she did not receive a grossly disproportionate sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant's conviction of selling, transferring, or delivering cocaine within 1,500 feet of a church in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-142(1) (Rev. 2005) was not the overwhelming weight of the evidence because there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury's finding that the sale took place within 1,500 feet of Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, the jury's verdict was proof that it believed a sale of crack cocaine took place, and the jury acted well within its province, and the record clearly established that the substance that was bought from defendant was placed in an evidence bag, taken to the Mississippi Crime Laboratory for testing, and determined to be crack cocaine. Defendant's trial attorney was not ineffective for failing to object to the court's jury instruction because the instruction fairly announced the law applicable to the facts presented.

He argued that no statute authorized a life sentence without parole, and his sentence violated his right against ex post facto punishment under Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 16 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death for capital murder. His case was remanded for a determination of whether or not he was mentally retarded for purposes of Atkins, a United States Supreme Court case holding that the execution of mentally retarded individuals violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It was determined that defendant was mentally retarded. The State requested that defendant be resentenced to life without parole. Defendant sought to be resentenced to life with the possibility of parole. The court of appeals held that the circuit court correctly applied &sect; 99-19-107 in resentencing defendant. Because defendant's death penalty was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Atkins, the application of &sect; 99-19-107 was appropriate. The statute clearly stated that no one whose death penalty was ruled unconstitutional could receive life with parole. The application of the statute in no way constituted an ex post facto punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of one count of the possession of child pornography and he was sentenced to 15 years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. The appellate court affirmed, stating that the probable cause for the search warrant was not rendered stale simply because an investigator first discovered the allegations 9 or 10 months after the alleged incident occurred. That was especially true in the context of allegations by small children. Because the images were stored on a computer, the probable cause for the investigator's search warrant was not rendered stale by the passage of time. Defendant's attorney presented no proof as to how he could have been better prepared to defend defendant if counsel would have had additional time to prepare for trial. Thus, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's second motion for a continuance. There was also no evidence that any of the computer viruses or other programs that defendant's computer expert described actually transferred any of the images of child pornography.</SPAN></P>

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 04/17/2008. TRIAL JUDGE: HON. ROBERT WALTER BAILEY. TRIAL COURT DISPOSITION: CONVICTED OF POSSESSION OF COCAINE (2.37 GRAMS) AND SENTENCED AS A HABITUAL OFFENDER TO LIFE IN THE CUSTODY OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS WITHOUT ELIGIBILITY FOR PROBATION, PAROLE, EARNED TIME, GOOD-TIME CREDIT, REDUCTION OR SUSPENSION.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in absentia of possession of approximately 2.37 grams of cocaine, in violation of Mississippi Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-83 (Rev. 2007), and the Lauderdale County Circuit Court (Mississippi) enhanced his sentence under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-147 (Rev. 2005) to a term of life imprisonment because he was a habitual offender. Defendant appealed, asserting two claims on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that: (1) his life sentence was disproportionate to the crime and constituted cruel and unusual punishment, and (2) the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial or, alternatively, for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Although life imprisonment was a rather severe sentence, the trial court had complete discretion in sentencing as long as it did not exceed the maximum as defined by statute. Because the conviction was defendant's second drug offense, he was subject to twice the maximum sentence or 60 years. As to the denial of his motion for a new trial, the jury heard testimony from two officers that a bag of cocaine was found in the back seat of the vehicle and that defendant was the only passenger in the back seat. Both officers testified that defendant exhibited suspicious behavior before the stop and behaved in a nervous-like manner during the stop, unlike the other persons in the vehicle. Also, a crack pipe and a small amount of cocaine were found on defendant's person during the pat-down search. Sufficient evidence supported the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate alleged that the convictions and sentences resulting from the multi-count indictment were illegal, and that his claim fell within one of the statutory exceptions to the three-year statute of limitations for filing a PCR motion under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5 (Rev. 2007). The circuit court denied the inmate's PCR motion, finding that it was time-barred and did not fall within any of the exceptions in &sect; 99-39-5. The court agreed. The inmate was mistaken regarding his contention that it was illegal for the State to charge more than one count in a single indictment. The inmate was also mistaken in his contention that the fondling charge merged into the sexual battery charge. It was true that the indictment charged that the fondling occurred over a period of time that included the specific date of the sexual battery, but that fact did not mandate that the fondling charge merged into the sexual battery charge. Sexual battery and fondling are separate crimes. Sexual battery requires penetration; fondling does not. Thus, the inmate was neither improperly indicted nor improperly sentenced, and nothing contained in his PCR motion moved it beyond the procedural bar of &sect; 99-39-5.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury of felony DUI as a habitual offender pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-81 (2007). The Lauderdale County Circuit Court (Mississippi) sentenced him to five years of imprisonment. Defendant appealed, raising five issued, which were recast as (1) whether the circuit court erred in failing to grant his pretrial motion to suppress evidence, and (2) whether he was denied due process during his trial proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's core argument was that the police chief had no authority to stop or arrest him, because he never committed any offense in the chief's jurisdiction. He further argued that his arrest occurred when the pursuit to make the arrest began and that he had not committed any felony at that time. Defendant was arrested after he arrived at his home and got out of his car. At that time, he had committed the crime of felony DUI, as well as the crime of driving with a suspended license. When the police chief began his pursuit, it was not a pursuit for the purpose of making an arrest. Rather, it was a pursuit to give a courtesy warning. Defendant's arrest was legal. Most of defendant's due process claims were subsumed in the larger issue of whether evidence of his DUI should have been suppressed because of his alleged illegal arrest. As to the other issues, they were without merit. There was no reversible error in the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself from hearing posttrial motions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of uttering a forgery in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-21-59. The Adam County Circuit Court, MS, accepted defendant's plea. Defendant timely filed a motion for postconviction relief, which the circuit court denied. Defendant timely appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that the circuit court imposed upon him an unconstitutional and disproportionate sentence. Defendant alleged that the circuit court improperly and unfairly considered other pending charges of uttering that he faced in other jurisdictions when it sentenced him. However, the case law held that in sentencing, the trial court had broad discretion in the things it was able to consider and may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited as to the kind of information it may consider, or the source from which it may come. In the instant case, the circuit court appeared to largely rely on the fact that defendant engaged in a &quot;malicious scheme&quot; to defraud merchants by using a computer program to create counterfeit checks. Thus, the instant court could not find that the circuit court abused its discretion in considering the pending charges against defendant when it sentenced defendant within the statutory limits provided in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-21-33. Because defendant's sentence fell within the statutory limits proscribed pursuant to &sect; 97-21-33, defendant's sentence did not lead this court to an inference of gross disproportionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the indictment was defective and the trial court erred by allowing it to be amended on the day of trial, the trial court erred by allowing the jury to observe him in restraints, there was no on the record findings concerning the state's peremptory challenges, prosecutorial misconduct, improper jury instructions and the trial court erred in denying his post-verdict motions. The appellate court found that defendant's indictment included the relevant language from Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-79. Furthermore, the evidence clearly showed that these crimes were based on the same act or transaction. Defendant's due process rights were not violated by amending the indictment to correct the spelling of a victim's last name. It was apparent that defendant's attorney did not think the jury had seen the leg restraints and defendant failed to request a mistrial or any further action. Since defendant offered no rebuttal, the trial court based its decision on the reasons for the peremptory challenge given by the state and found these reasons to be race-neutral.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of the sale of cocaine and she was sentenced to 25 years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, with five years suspended, and five years of post-release supervision. The appellate court affirmed, stating that the denial of her motion for a change of venue was proper under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-15-35 (Rev. 2007) because none of the venire persons indicated to the trial judge that they would have difficulty in granting defendant a fair trial. Based on the questions asked by the trial judge and the lack of any affirmative responses thereto, an impartial was impaneled. The denial of the motion to quash the jury panel was proper under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 13-5-2 (Rev. 2002) because a single venire wherein a distinctive group was underrepresented did not constitute systematic exclusion of that group from the jury-selection process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner appealed a judgment of the Pike County Circuit Court (Mississippi) that denied his motion for postconviction relief following his convictions, based upon guilty pleas, of sexual abuse of a vulnerable adult who lived in a nursing home, one count of sexual battery, two burglary-related counts, and two counts of voyeurism, which stemmed from him peeping into nursing homes and spying upon the residents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, petitioner argued that convicting him of both sexual abuse of a vulnerable adult and sexual battery violated double jeopardy concerns and that the circuit court erred in banishing him from the state after he served his prison terms. On review, the court held that the crime of sexual abuse of a vulnerable adult under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-47-19 (Supp. 2008) did not encompass the crime of sexual battery under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-95 (Rev. 2006), and a conviction of both offenses did not implicate double jeopardy concerns because the crimes required additional and different elements of proof; specifically, the former offense did not require proof of penetration, while the latter offense did require this proof. Additionally, abuse of a vulnerable adult required proof that defendant willfully inflicted physical pain or injury upon a vulnerable adult, while sexual battery had no such requirement. Regarding petitioner's sentence, the court held that, although it appeared from the record that petitioner's banishment from Mississippi was part of an agreed upon sentencing recommendation, the practice of dumping criminals has been held improper on public policy grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment denying the petition for post-conviction relief was modified to strike the banishment provision. As modified, the circuit court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The CONs were revoked after there was no substantial progress made on two projects. The chancery court found that the MSDH had the authority to revoke the CONs and that its decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The hospital sought review. In affirming, the appellate court noted that, even though the Mississippi Legislature had authorized the CONs, this did not mean that the MSDH did not have the power to revoke them. The language in Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 47-1-191, 41-7-195 indicated that the Legislature did not intend for the CONs to exist in perpetuity. Further, nothing in &sect; 41-7-195(4) indicated that the Legislature intended to limit the revocation power of the MSDH to only those CONs that were not authorized by statute. Next, even though a hearing officer made a misstatement regarding deference, the hearing officer still fulfilled her obligation to weigh the evidence. The hospital experienced no prejudice based on an attorney general's opinion. Finally, the decision to revoke the CONs was not arbitrary or capricious since the hospital had not done anything that qualified as a commencement of construction or a good faith effort to obligate an approved expenditure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Oktibbeha County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of obtaining merchandise valued at $ 100 or more under false pretenses in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-19-55 (Rev. 2000), and which sentenced him as a habitual offender, under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-83 (Rev. 2000) to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole or probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant wrote a bad check to a liquor store. On appeal, the court determined that the testimony of a bank employee that defendant received regular monthly account statements, that defendant's account was closed due to returned checks, and that a few days after the closure defendant would have received an account closure notification was legally sufficient to establish that defendant knew of his negative balance and of the account's closure prior to his writing the bad check. In addition, introduction into evidence of bank statements properly fell under Miss. R. Evid. 404(b) exceptions of knowledge and intent, and under Miss. R. Evid. 403, the evidence was not overly prejudicial as the bank record did not include any information regarding other indictments, it was accompanied by a limiting instruction and the prosecutor did not emphasize any other bounced checks. Finally, the court found that life imprisonment was not constitutionally disproportionate for defendant's conviction as a habitual offender under &sect; 99-19-83 because defendant's criminal history showed that he had an inability to conform his behavior to the requirements that society expected of him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee city filed a complaint for injunctive relief asking a county court to order appellant property owner to remove offending vehicles from his property. The case was transferred to the Chancery Court of Rankin County, Mississippi, which entered a judgment finding the property owner to be in violation of the city's ordinances and granting an injunction in favor of the city. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A number of inoperable motor vehicles, in various states of repair, were located on the property owner's property, which had been recently annexed. The city notified the property owner via certified letter that he was in violation of city zoning ordinances by parking inoperable and unlicensed motor vehicles on his residential property and not in his driveway. The property owner maintained that he used several of the vehicles as storage for his farming equipment and supplies. On appeal, the property owner cited no authority indicating that he should be allowed to maintain a nuisance following rezoning or annexation as he would be allowed to continue a nonconforming use of his land. Moreover, the chancellor allowed the property owner to keep any of the vehicles that were usable in the farming operation. The appellate court found no violation of the property owner's right to continue his nonconforming use of the land. The property owner next argued that Brandon, Miss., Code of Ordinances &sect; 34-21 was unconstitutionally vague; however, the appellate court found that the ordinance provided a reasonable person an ordinary opportunity to understand the prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

Decisions regarding the maintenance and repair of highways and the placement of traffic control devices were discretionary matters entrusted to public officials. Because their decisions involved discretionary functions and not ministerial adherence to established policy or protocol, their discretionary acts were subject to immunity under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-9(1)(d). Further, where any of the immunities enumerated in Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Winston County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of possession of less than 0.10 gram of cocaine in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139(c)(1)(A) (Rev. 2005), and which sentenced him to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole based on his status as a habitual offender under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-83 (Rev. 2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence against him was insufficient to convict him and that his sentence was cruel and unusual. According to defendant, because the amount of cocaine was so insignificant that it could not bee seen with the naked eye and thus, the State failed to show knowledge. A forensic examiner testified that the cocaine testified that she found cocaine in defendant's shirt pocket and in one of pocket of his pants, and that it was visible with the naked eye. The court found that a reasonable fact-finder could infer that defendant possessed the cocaine found in his pockets because it was found in the clothes defendant was wearing when he was arrested. The jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant was wearing his own clothes. Thus, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to convict him. The court determined that defendant's life sentence without parole was mandatory under the circumstances and did not arise solely from his conviction of possession of cocaine but based on his status as a habitual offender. Finally, defendant's claim was procedurally barred because he did not address all three factors of the proportionality analysis.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the circuit court erred in dismissing her motion and that she was not procedurally barred from raising the issue of involuntary plea based on new evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that the trial court did not err in dismissing the motion because none of the arguments proposed by defendant as grounds for relief fell within the purview of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(1) (Rev. 2007). Defendant acknowledged that she freely and voluntarily entered a guilty plea to both charges and that she understood the maximum penalty allowed. In addition, the issues of new evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel were procedurally barred from review by the court because they were being raised for the first time in the appeal. Furthermore, defendant's plea would nullify any belief that new evidence would prove that she was wrongfully accused, charged, and sentenced. Finally, considering the dialogue between defendant and the trial judge in her plea colloquy, the court was satisfied that defendant received adequate legal service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a medical malpractice action, appellant, the executrix of a decedent's estate, challenged a judgment of the Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi) that granted the motion to dismiss of appellee health care providers, arguing that the circuit court erred in dismissing her lawsuit based upon her failure to a certificate of consultation as required by Mississippi Code Annotated section 11-1-58(1)(a) (Supp. 2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The executrix commenced a medical malpractice action but failed to file a certificate of consultation stating that her attorney had consulted with a qualified medical expert and concluded that there was a reasonable basis for the action. Based upon the absence of the certificate, the health care providers moved to dismiss. Although the executrix filed a certificate of consultation, the circuit court granted the motion, finding that the certificate was insufficient in failing to set forth that the consultation occurred before the lawsuit was filed. The executrix filed a motion to reconsider, attaching affidavits establishing that the consultation occurred before the lawsuit was filed. The circuit court denied the motion. On review, the court concluded that the circuit court erred in granting the motion to dismiss. Only the statute supreme court had the authority to promulgate rules of procedure; the statute was an unconstitutional procedural statute. A complaint, otherwise properly filed in accordance with the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure, could not be dismissed and need not be amended simply because a plaintiff failed to attach a certificate.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court found that it was barred from relitigating its prior determination that the zoning decision was not arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory or beyond the zoning board's legal authority.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Bolivar County Circuit Court (Mississippi) that convicted him of attempted burglary of an automobile, arguing that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the defense of abandonment, that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and that the imposition of a life sentence was excessive under the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant approached a parked vehicle, rubbed dew off of the vehicle's window, and looked inside. He then went to a second vehicle and broke its window. When the car's alarm sounded, defendant ran to the vehicle in which his accomplice was waiting, and the accomplice drove the pair away. On review of defendant's conviction of attempted burglary of an automobile, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the defense of abandonment. The abandonment instruction was not supported by the evidence because the evidence suggested that the burglary would have been completed if defendant had not been interrupted by the car alarm. Further, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because a police investigator testified that he saw defendant approach a vehicle and look inside before moving onto a second vehicle, looking inside, and breaking its window. In addition, where defendant had previously been convicted of robbery and two charges of burglary, the trial court properly sentenced defendant as a habitual offender under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-83 (Rev. 2007).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for nearly striking two officers during a police chase. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by allowing the State to amend the indictments as the amendments eliminated the language alleging any overt act by defendant's attempt to cause bodily harm to the officers, and therefore, because the amendments resulted in substantially defective indictments, defendant's convictions were reversed. The court held that the trial court also erred by refusing to give a lesser non-included offense jury instruction of reckless driving under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-3-1201 (Rev. 2004) because, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to defendant and based on defendant's testimony, the jury could have found that, rather than attempting to hit one officer with his car, he was merely attempting to avoid running into another officer's vehicle, and that defendant went into another officer's lane to allow more room for a car that had pulled over to the right side of the road and that he did not attempt to hit the officer's car or run him off the road.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Warren County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of the possession of cocaine, more then 10 grams, but less than 30 grams, in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139(c)(1)(D) (Rev. 2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed after he was convicted of the possession of cocaine, more than 10 grams, but less than 30 grams. The appellate court affirmed, stating that he was not denied his right to a speedy trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 26. He was aware of the possibility that charges would be brought against him as a result of his arrest and he did not seek any resolution of the charges until after he was served with the indictment in June 2006. Additionally, there was no actual prejudice to defendant as a result of the delay between arrest and trial. The State did not lack jurisdiction to prosecute the charge against defendant even though he was arrested on property owned by the United States because the State was free to enforce its criminal and civil laws on federal land as long as those laws did not conflict with federal law. Thus, the State had jurisdiction to arrest defendant and bring him to trial. Though defendant's sentence might have seemed harsh in light of the sentences received by others convicted of drug possession, his sentence fit within the statutory maximum under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-81 (Rev. 2007).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant prisoner appealed a judgment of the Lamar County Circuit Court, Mississippi, which dismissed his motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In October 2004, the prisoner pleaded guilty to the crime of sale and transfer of cocaine. He was sentenced to 15 years in the custody of the Department of Corrections with seven years to serve and eight years suspended. At the time the prisoner committed his crime, offenders convicted of sale or transfer of a controlled substance were eligible to be placed in trusty status and to accumulate trusty-earned time pursuant to former Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-5-138.1 (Rev. 2001). However, prior to the time he was convicted and sentenced, the statute was amended to exclude offenders convicted of sale or transfer of a controlled substance from eligibility for the earned-time allowance. The effective date of the amendment was April 28, 2004. The instant court concluded that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing the prisoner's motion. An evidentiary hearing was necessary to decide whether application of the amended statute in this case constituted an ex post facto violation. In order to show an ex post facto violation, the prisoner would have to demonstrate that application of the amended statute to him created a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment for his crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Lowndes County Circuit Court, Mississippi, convicted defendant of two counts of the sale of cocaine and sentenced him to serve twenty years on Count I and fourteen years on Count II, to run consecutively, the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the circuit court erred in refusing to sever Counts I and II of his indictment; in refusing to grant a continuance and to grant one of his peremptory challenges during jury selection; in refusing to grant a mistrial; and his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The appellate court found that the circuit court did not err in refusing to sever Counts I and II of the indictment as they were separated by only one day, the alleged crimes were the same, and they involved substantially the same facts and witnesses. Manifest injustice did not result from the denial of defendant's motion for a continuance. The State made a sufficient prima facie showing that race was a possible criteria in the defense counsel's exercise of peremptory challenges. The reasons proffered by the defense attorney were not merely pretextual under Batson. Where the prosecutor mistakenly asked an improper question, the circuit judge took appropriate remedial steps, and defendant's motion for mistrial was properly denied. Defendant offered no support for his argument that consecutive sentences for drug offenses within the statutory limits were grossly disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After pleading guilty to being an habitual offender for the sale of cocaine, appellant movant received a 30-year sentence. The movant's sentence was suspended, provided that he comply with several conditions. The movant did not comply, and his suspended sentence was revoked. The Forrest County Circuit Court, Mississippi, dismissed the movant's request for post-conviction relief. Aggrieved, the movant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court ordered the movant to leave Hattiesburg as a condition of the suspended sentence. On appeal, the movant asserted the following: (1) the circuit court erred by imposing the conditions of the suspended sentence without first placing him on probation under the supervision of the Mississippi Department of Corrections; (2) the banishment was unenforceable and illegal; (3) the 30-year banishment was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-33(1) (Rev. 2004) did not prohibit felons from receiving suspension and then being placed on probation. The conditions placed on the movant's suspended sentence did not equate to the movant being placed on probation. Further, the movant was not entitled to any relief because he suffered no injury or prejudice from receiving a lawful, yet lenient, sentence. As to whether the movant received ineffective assistance of counsel, the movant had acknowledged during his guilty plea proceeding that he was satisfied with the advice he received and the help his attorney had provided. Also, even if the movant's claim of deficient performance were supported by evidence, the movant failed to present any evidence that the movant was prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the Attala County Circuit Court (Mississippi) found defendant guilty of two counts of trafficking in stolen firearms under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-37-35(3)(c) (Rev. 2006), but acquitted him on all three counts of burglary. He was sentenced to serve two concurrent 30-year sentences. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-37-35(3)(c) (Rev. 2006) was unconstitutional, but his constitutional attacks on Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-37-35 were procedurally barred because the issues he presented were not previously raised before the trial court. In addition, defendant's conviction was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence because the accomplice's testimony was reasonable, consistent, and substantially uncontradicted. Furthermore, the jury received a cautionary instruction relating to the manner in which the accomplice testimony should be viewed. Additionally, the accomplice's testimony that defendant knew the firearms were stolen was corroborated because defendant told the investigators that he had nothing to do with the burglaries and only pointed out places where guns were sold. Moreover, one of the buyers testified that defendant sold the guns to him. Also, under the Eighth Amendment, defendant's 30-year sentence for each offense was not unconstitutionally disproportionate to his crime as it was within the statutory guidelines, was below the potential life sentence he could have received, and was not grossly disproportionate to the crime he committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In addressing appellant inmate's various filings, the Marshall County Circuit Court (Mississippi) treated them as a motion for post-conviction relief and denied relief to appellant. On appeal, he claimed that his motions were not post-conviction motions and instead, they were complaints under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his filings, appellant alleged that he was housed in inhuman conditions, e.g., the windows of the facility would not open, there were no air conditioners installed, and the facility lacked a fire sprinkler system, thereby creating a fire hazard. His allegations did not fall under any of the grounds for post-conviction relief enumerated in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(1). Therefore, he was not entitled to any relief under the post-conviction statute. Because the circuit court treated the filings as a motion for post-conviction relief, it was proper to deny relief. Appellant's attempt to assert a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was without merit because he never filed any such complaint or any corresponding summons; he only filed various motions and documents. Under Miss. R. Civ. P. 3(a), a party had to file a complaint to institute an action. Whether appellant properly asserted grounds sufficient to warrant relief under &sect; 1983 was irrelevant because he did not file a complaint asserting those grounds. Moreover, appellant filed his motion against the State and the State could not be sued under &sect; 1983 in state court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted in the Lee County Circuit Court of four counts of embezzlement and sentenced to a total of ten years each in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections and an $ 11,000 fine. Defendants were also ordered to pay restitution. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by failing to grant a continuance to allow defendants' attorney to prepare for trial after he took the case a few days before trial was set to begin. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendants presented no concrete facts to demonstrate any prejudice against them. Although the attorney had a limited amount of time to interview witnesses and review the admittedly large amount of documents in the case, defendants presented no evidence that the lack of time had any impact on their case. They pointed to no particular witness whose questioning might have made a difference, nor did they indicate that there was anything in the documents that could have been discovered had the attorney had more time to review the case. In the absence of any showing of prejudice, defendants failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant them a last-minute continuance, especially in light of the fact that five continuances had already been granted to the defense over the course of almost a year and a half. Therefore, the trial court properly denied defendants' motion for a continuance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate entered a guilty plea to one count of simple assault on an officer. A suspended sentence imposed was revoked. The trial court dismissed an application for post-conviction relief, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the inmate failed to establish that he received ineffective assistance of counsel under the Strickland test. In addition, the inmate failed to include a sworn affidavit to support his claim or explain why it was not include with his post-conviction motion, as required by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-9(1) (2007). Next, there was a factual basis for the plea given the inmate's admission. An evidentiary hearing was not required under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-11(2) (Rev. 2000). There was no indication that the inmate's mental capabilities were at issue; he failed to demonstrate that the was incapable of making a rational defense. Moreover, the inmate was able to answer all question and testify during the plea hearing. There was no error in finding a violation of the terms of supervision, the inmate was not entitled to an attorney at the revocation proceeding, and the sentence was not cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the Grenada County Circuit Court (Mississippi) found defendant guilty of murder under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(1) (Rev. 2006). The trial court sentenced him to life in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant admitted he was the only adult at home with the victim that day. Also, the evidence of the bloody T-shirt, the bloody piece of the crutch and stopper, and the numerous circular injuries on the victim's body from another piece of the crutch strongly suggested that defendant beat the victim severely with a crutch. In addition, the evidence showed that the crutch broke into pieces, and that defendant disposed of the pieces, but that he overlooked the two pieces found by the police. Additionally, defendant's actions of beating and strangling the victim were willful acts likely to cause death or serious bodily injury and evinced a reckless indifference to the danger to human life from which malice could be inferred. Furthermore, defendant's expressions of unfamiliarity with the basics of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while possessing certification in CPR and first aid training were inconsistent with his innocence of murder. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of murder. Also, under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-21 (Rev. 2006), defendant was convicted of only murder and was properly sentenced to life imprisonment, not to life without the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the Chicksaw County Circuit Court (Mississippi) found defendant not guilty of capital murder under Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motions for a directed verdict or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because there was evidence of (1) three confessions made by defendant in the presence of three different individuals; (2) a strained relationship between defendant and the victim; (3) defendant's dislike for her job as a live-in-caretaker and the victim; and (4) the victim's autopsy showed he did not die of natural causes because he was alive when the fire started. Thus, there was sufficient proof presented at trial to establish the essential elements of murder. In addition, regarding defendant's motion for a new trial, her argument centered around her contention that there was no evidence that she caused the fire, thereby causing the victim's death; however, because of the many inconsistencies in the various statements of what happened the night of the fire, not to mention defendant's confessions, allowing the verdict to stand did not sanction an unconscionable injustice. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a new trial. Finally, the trial court did not err in accepting a verdict of guilty of murder.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. After signing a &quot;waiver of rights&quot; form read to him by officers, defendant described the events leading up to the victim's death. During the suppression hearing, defendant testified that the officer promised him treatment as a youthful offender if he told the truth about what happened to the victim. However, officers all testified that defendant gave his confession voluntarily, and he was not promised anything for his truthfulness. After questions arose about defendant's limited learning capacity, all three again testified that defendant did not seem to have any problems understanding his rights, and he signed the waiver of rights form willingly after his rights were read to him. At the hearing, defendant was able to read aloud for the trial court each right listed on the waiver. Although he claimed to not remember where he lived, or any of his teachers' names, defendant acknowledged initialing the waiver in front of the officers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a passenger in a car. As the car approached a safety checkpoint conducted by the Mississippi Highway Patrol, the driver accelerated and sped away. Officers gave chase and noticed defendant throwing bags out of the open passenger side of the vehicle. An officer retrieved a bag containing 450.6 grams of marijuana, which had been thrown out of the moving car by defendant. Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell as a habitual offender. He was sentenced to 60 years in prison. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict or a new trial. The court could not say that the verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Further, the sentence was not grossly disproportionate to the crime with which defendant was charged. Defendant was aware of his own criminal history and chose to proceed to trial. He was apprised of the perilous situation he faced if he was found guilty at trial. Finally, the trial court did not err in allowing the State to amend the indictment after the verdict but prior to sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The evidence included the murder weapon, the eyewitness testimony, the testimony of police, and the conclusions of the coroner and the doctor who performed the autopsy. Due to the direct testimony of the eyewitness, there was no need to give a circumstantial evidence instruction. The State did not introduce evidence of prior bad acts under Miss. R. Evid. 404(b). There was probable cause to arrest defendant for the crime. The appellate court was unable to review alleged errors relating to jury instructions due to a failure to comply with Miss. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Rankin County Chancery Court, Mississippi, convicted appellant inmate of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. The circuit court sentenced the inmate to twenty-five years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. The appellate court affirmed the circuit court. The inmate's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&nbsp;1983 complaint in the Hinds County Chancery Court was dismissed. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court noted that to the extent that the inmate sought his freedom through a collateral attack on his conviction, his complaint had to be viewed as an action under the Post-Conviciton Collateral Relief Act, Miss.

To the extent that the inmate sought damages against state entities, officials, and employees, his complaint had to be viewed as an action under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;11-46-1 (Rev. 2002). Because the appellate court affirmed the inmate's conviction on direct appeal, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;99-39-7 mandated that he obtain permission from the supreme court to seek post-conviction relief from the trial court. He failed to do so. The chancery court lacked jurisdiction to entertain his collateral attacks and the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to entertain his appeal. Those governmental entities and employees were immune from the inmate's lawsuit as he was incarcerated when he filed his complaint. The inmate could not sue the various officials based on the constitutionality of his arrest under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&nbsp;1983 as his conviction had not been invalidated. The inmate's appeal was frivolous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of sale of cocaine under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139(b)(1) and was sentenced to serve 30 years' imprisonment with 15 years suspended.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Concluding that defendant's allegations of error contained no merit, the court held that: (1) defendant's allegation that he was subject to an excessive sentence was founded on his mistaken belief that he should have been sentenced for mere possession of cocaine under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139(c); (2) Miss. Code Ann.&sect; 41-29-139 was not unconstitutionally ambiguous because a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that one could be subject to up to 30 years' imprisonment for the sale of cocaine; (3) none of various alleged flaws in the indictment rendered it defective because some of these flaws, such as failure to include a sworn affidavit by the foreman of the grand jury, were waived by the guilty plea, while others, such as failure to contain the amount of cocaine sold, were not legal defects; (4) defendant's allegation that he was threatened with 20 years' imprisonment, a punishment below the maximum, if he did not enter a plea of guilty did not make the guilty plea involuntary; and (5) because the sentence was within the statutory maximum for the sale of cocaine and the indictment was not defective, defendant could not demonstrate that his counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

For many years, defendants used an insurer to provide funeral insurance for their customers. The insurer terminated its relationship with defendants; however, many of defendants' clients continued to send their payments to defendants. On appeal, defendants alleged, inter alia, that: (1) they were denied effective representation; (2.) they were never addressed as to a conflict of interest; (3) the trial court erred in not declaring a mistrial. The appellate court rejected the contentions. The fact that new counsel only a few days before trial did not entitle defendants to a continuance. As to the alleged conflict of interest, there was no actual conflict of interest present. There were three distinct incidents about alleged prosecutorial misconduct; however, the issue was without merit. The trial court did err, however, in sentencing the defendants when Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-23-19 proscribed the same conduct but provided more lenient punishment. The trial court also erred in ordering defendants to pay restitution to the policyholders because the policyholders who benefitted from the restitution lost nothing as a result of the misconduct.</SPAN></P>

His later motion for PCR relief was dismissed, and this appeal followed. In affirming the dismissal of the PCR motion, the appellate court decided to consider the case, even though it was untimely under Miss. R. App. P. 4(a). Next, although the portion of the sentence relating to house arrest was illegal under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-5-1003 (Rev. 2004) due to the inmate's prior record, there was no reversible error since the inmate received the benefitted from such. Moreover, the inmate did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel because he was correctly advised of the maximum sentence under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-21-33 (Supp. 2003). Even though the issue was not raised by the inmate, the appellate court found that an illegal sentence was imposed in excess of the 10-year maximum. Therefore, the case was remanded for resentencing for a term not longer than 10 years.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, another witness testified that he observed defendant and the victim argue and saw a &quot;hand motion&quot; from defendant during the argument. Afterwards, the victim stated that defendant had cut him. Defendant was sentenced to 15 years, with 10 to serve and 5 years of post-release supervision. The appellate court affirmed that sentence, stating that it was not grossly disproportionate to the crime committed. The sentence was well within the statutory guidelines set forth in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-7(2) (Rev. 2006) and the trial court noted that aggravated assault was a serious crime. The trial court also considered the fact that defendant had a relatively clean record, with no prior felony convictions, and that defendant had been consistently employed.</SPAN></P>

The record showed that the inmate was informed of the consequences of the plea by the trial court. Even if his attorney suggested that he might receive a sentence of 8 to 12 years, this prediction did not render the plea involuntary. Moreover, the sentence imposed was not disproportionate since it was within the statutory limitations in Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-29-313, 41-29-147 (Rev. 2005). By pleading guilty, the inmate waived his claims relating to calling witnesses during his suppression hearing and the right to a speedy trial.

Although defendant argued that the statute was ambiguous because he believed Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139(b) conflicted with &sect;&nbsp;41-29-139(c), he was convicted under the subsection that criminalized the sale of a controlled substance, while &sect; 41-29-139(c) proscribed possession of a controlled substance. They were two different provisions dealing with two different situations. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague as a person of ordinary intelligence would understand by reading Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;41-29-139(b) that he could face significant prison time for selling cocaine. The sale of controlled substances did not infringe on any of defendant's constitutionally protected rights. The issues concerning the alleged defects in the indictment were without merit.

He was also ordered to pay a fine and court costs and he was disbarred. The appellate court affirmed, stating that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The presence of direct evidence meant that his case was not a circumstantial evidence case. And, it was in the context of the issuance of search warrants that a confidential informant must be proven reliable. Defendant's client did not supply information to obtain a search warrant. Instead, the client cooperated with authorities during the equivalent of a sting operation. The judge in the trial did not need to recuse himself because nothing in the judge's response gave rise to overcome the presumption of impartiality. Defendant only speculated that the judge could not have been impartial. The denial of defendant's motion for a change of venue was rightfully denied because the impaneled jury members all stated that they would serve as fair and impartial jurors. The denial of an accomplice instruction was proper because the client was not an accomplice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer suspected that defendant was intoxicated after observing his driving. When the officer tried to pull the vehicle over by use of his siren and blue lights, defendant sped off at a high rate of speed. Defendant traveled over the center line and forced two other vehicles to pull off the highway. Defendant was found guilty, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the indictment included every essential element of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-9-72(2) (Rev. 2006). The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that he should have been charged with a misdemeanor instead under &sect; 97-9-72(1). The indictment successfully alleged that, after defendant was signalled to stop, he continued to operate his motor vehicle with a reckless disregard for the safety of others. Next, the indictment did not have to allege that defendant was guilty of an underlying crime because the crime of fleeing a law officer in a motor vehicle was not predicated on another. Finally, defendant's argument that &sect; 97-9-72(2) was void for vagueness was not considered since it was raised for the first time on review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate entered a guilty plea to a second degree burglary charge. A subsequent &quot;notice of post-conviction relief&quot; was denied, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court held there was no procedure for filing a &quot;notice&quot; for post-conviction relief; the filing clearly stated that the document was a motion. Next, the trial court was not required to return the filing to the inmate under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-9(4) (Supp. 2006). The motion did not contain a concise statement of the statement or grounds upon which the motion was based, as required by Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;99-39-9(1)(c) (Supp. 2006), nor did it state a claim upon which relief could have been granted under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(1) (Supp. 2006). The determination of whether to return the motion to the inmate was left to the trial court since it did not comply with the statutory requirements. Further, the inmate was not prejudiced by the forfeiture of earned time under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-5-138 (Supp. 2006) because he was unable to earn such as a habitual offender. Finally, there was no evidence that the judge in the case should have recused himself based on a comment about the proceeding being a &quot;sham.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1995, defendant entered guilty pleas to several different drug and weapon charges. He was sentenced as a habitual offender pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-81 (Rev. 2000), based on four prior felony convictions. More than nine years later, in 2004, defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief, asserting that the habitual offender statute under which he was sentenced was unconstitutional because it did not require a jury trial to determine whether an offender met the eligibility requirements for enhanced punishment. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court found defendant's argument unavailing, as his assertions were based on a misperception of the law. Defendant had no entitlement to a jury trial on the issue of whether or not he qualified for enhanced punishment under the habitual offender statute. Defendant failed to prove that an intervening decision of the United States Supreme Court or the Mississippi Supreme Court excepted the procedural time bar of his claim pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2) (Supp. 2006).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant and cross-appellee lessee, a corporation, challenged a judgment of the Jefferson County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which entered an order finding the lessee comparatively liable, together with defendant general contractor and a subcontractor, for personal injuries to the lessee's employees and patrons. Appellee and cross-appellant lessor appealed on the amount of damages awarded for injury to his property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessee ran a store. Pursuant to the lease, the lessee was to have renovations made in a workmanlike manner. The lessee contracted with a general contractor for the work, and the general contractor contracted with a subcontractor for removal of a wall. The roof partially collapsed during the removal of the wall, injuring some of the lessee's employees and patrons. The lessee settled the personal injury claims. Subsequently, the lessor sued the lessee for breach of contract and the general contractor for negligence. The trial court apportioned liability, finding the lessee 50 percent at fault, the general contractor 30 percent at fault, and the subcontractor 20 percent at fault under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 85-5-7 (Supp. 2006). In reversing, the court held that the trial court had improperly found that the lessee negligently performed its duties as architect because the contract was silent as to the duties of an architect and, absent a delineation of such duties, no duty to warn could be imputed to the lessee. The court held that the trial court's damages calculation was sustainable but that it might also be proper to further evaluate the damage award, if appropriate, on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
