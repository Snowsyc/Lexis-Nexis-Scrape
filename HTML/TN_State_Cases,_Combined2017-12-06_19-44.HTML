Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-108, to validate the search warrant in defendant's case was an ex post facto violation under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. HOLDINGS: [1]-The ERRA was not an ex post facto statute as applied in defendant's case. As a result, defendant's motion to suppress the evidence against him, under Tenn. R. Crim. P. 41, was not well-taken because the error in the date written on the search warrant in the case was a good faith or technical mistake and the trial court properly ruled that, pursuant to the ERRA, the evidence was not to be suppressed; [2]-The evidence supported defendant's convictions for first degree premeditated murder, attempted first degree premeditated murder, and aggravated assault and the jury's rejection of defendant's self-defense claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant employer appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) that denied its motions to dismiss the case based on the statute of repose in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-26-116(a)(3) (2012), and to amend its answer to add the statute as an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff husband took his wife, who was 36 weeks pregnant, to the hospital after she vomited what appeared to be blood. When the resident obstetrician on call determined that the baby needed to be delivered by cesarean section, defendant nurse anesthetist was called away, and defendant owner/president declined to go to the hospital. Consequently, an anesthesiologist who did not work in obstetrics and was employed by defendant second employer, provided anesthesia for the surgery. Almost immediately after the first anesthetic drugs were administered to the wife, she began having respiratory distress and eventually died. The husband alleged that the employer was vicariously liable for the negligent acts of the nurse anesthetist and its owner/president. The state supreme court held that the running of &sect; 29-26-116(a)(3) did not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. The statute of repose was an affirmative defense under Rule 8.03. Therefore, as the employer did not raise the statute of repose as an affirmative defense at any time before trial, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying its motions.</SPAN></P>

The state's highest court had subject matter jurisdiction to include an assessment of costs in the order of enforcement, and was not divested of subject matter jurisdiction due to pending appeals. Attorneys in disciplinary proceedings were not entitled to the same due process rights afforded criminal defendants. Tennessee's disciplinary processes satisfied due process.

The panel had authority to adjudicate the attorney's petition, even though its members had not taken an oath under Tenn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, a passenger and his wife, filed an action against defendants, a bus owner, a bus manufacturer, and a bus window manufacturer. They challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Tennessee), which held that Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) 205 and 208, 49 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 571.205 and 571.208, preempted their claims based on the lack of passenger seatbelts on a bus and the material used in the window glass of the bus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court held that plaintiffs' claims were not preempted by federal law. FMVSS 208 did not preempt plaintiffs' claim based on defendants' failure to provide passenger seatbelts. The history of seatbelt regulation under FMVSS 208, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) explanation of its objectives, and its views on the preemptive effect of the regulation compelled the conclusion that FMVSS 208 did not preempt plaintiffs' claim premised on the lack of passenger seatbelts. FMVSS 205 did not preempt that portion of plaintiffs' claim based upon the use of tempered glass side windows. There was no indication that the primary concern raised by defendants, the increased risk of impact neck injuries associated with laminated glass, motivated NHTSA's decision to give manufacturers the option of installing side windows made of tempered glass rather than requiring laminated glass. The bus did not have passenger seatbelts. Thus, the concern that laminated glass could be more dangerous for belted passengers did not apply, and plaintiffs' claim did not stand as an obstacle to the regulatory objective of reducing injuries caused by impact with glazing surfaces.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the court of appeals to decide the remaining issues raised.</SPAN></P>

The trial court informed defendant of his right to present mitigation evidence and questioned him to determine whether he understood his rights and the importance of presenting mitigation evidence. The trial court called defendant to make a special appearance to testify about his decision to waive mitigation evidence. The trial court confirmed that defendant and counsel discussed the importance of mitigating evidence. The trial court also asked defendant to define mitigating circumstances and describe how he envisioned the jury would factor that evidence into its decision. Finally, the trial court considered defendant's explanation for waiving the evidence. When defendant announced his desire to offer non-mental health mitigation evidence, the trial court again discussed with him the specific parameters of the evidence he wished to present.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant prisoner sought post-conviction relief after the deadline contained in the Post-Conviction Procedure Act of 1995, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(a) (2012), had passed because his former attorney provided him the wrong deadline date and failed to give the prisoner his legal files until after the deadline passed. He challenged a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee), which affirmed the dismissal of his petition as untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court held that the statute of limitations was tolled. The prisoner was effectively abandoned by his appellate attorney after his petition for writ of certiorari was filed in the United States Supreme Court. That abandonment impeded the prisoner's otherwise diligent efforts to file a timely post-conviction petition. He was pursuing his rights diligently. Nothing in the record indicated that the prisoner was aware that the United States Supreme Court had denied his petition for certiorari until he received a misleading letter from his appellate lawyer five months after the fact. That letter also belatedly alerted the prisoner to the possibility of post-conviction relief. The prisoner did not already possess the files he needed, and the files his lawyer held contained critical information for his post-conviction petition. The lawyer's unreasonable delay in sending the prisoner his files, exacerbated by the lawyer's erroneous deadline and the delay in notifying the prisoner that his direct appeals were exhausted and that the attorney-client relationship had ended, constituted an objective factor, an impediment that could not be fairly attributed to the prisoner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court reversed the decision of the court of criminal appeals and remanded the case to the trial court to proceed with the prisoner's petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The state's highest court held that a motion to reopen was the proper vehicle for bringing the inmate's claims. The inmate's motion was filed within one year of Coleman for Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-117(a)(1) purposes. However, Coleman did not establish a new retroactive rule for proving an intellectual disability in Tennessee under the Eighth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. Coleman concerned the interpretation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-203 (2010), and held that the courts could consider factors other than raw test scores in determining intellectual disability. To qualify as actually innocent under &sect; 40-30-117(a)(2), the inmate had to show actual innocence of the underlying crimes. There was no separate offense in Tennessee for capital murder, and the inmate had pled guilty to first degree murder. The death penalty was a sentencing consideration, rather than an independent offense. To reopen post-conviction proceedings under &sect; 40-30-117(a)(2) (2006), the inmate had to present scientific evidence that he was actually innocent of the offense. The claim that the inmate was ineligible for the death penalty did not qualify as an actual innocence claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant waited in her truck while her son and an accomplice burglarized the victim's home. The trial court applied the enhancement factor of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-114(10)--that defendant committed a crime when the risk to human life was high, as the homeowner could have arrived at any time and placed the perpetrators at risk. The intermediate appellate court reduced the sentences on grounds the trial court improperly applied this enhancement factor. The high court held that under the 2005 amendments to the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989, even if a trial court improperly applied an enhancement factor, it did not abuse its discretion if it did not increase the sentence beyond the minimum on the basis of that factor. It adopted an abuse of discretion standard of review, granting a presumption of reasonableness to within-range sentencing decisions that reflected a proper application of the purposes and principles of the Act. Though the trial court relied on an erroneous enhancement factor, the sentence it imposed was supported by the reasons it articulated in the record, including the need for deterrence; thus, the sentence should not have been reduced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The high court reversed the intermediate appellate court's sentence modification and reinstated the sentence the trial court imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State challenged a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee), which affirmed the trial court's order sustaining defendant's motion to suppress cocaine a police officer observed in his vehicle. The officer stopped defendant for a traffic violation and observed the cocaine when he ordered defendant out of his vehicle to sign the citation pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-207 (2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court held that the trial court erroneously ruled that the officer had concluded the stop by handing defendant his driver's license before removing him from the car. The officer was entitled to remove defendant from the vehicle for a short period of time after making the traffic stop. The officer described the stop of defendant as &quot;normal.&quot; Nothing in the record indicated that the stop lasted more than five minutes. The officer, who was the only witness at the hearing, testified that he had not returned the driver's license before asking defendant to step outside the vehicle, and upon further inquiry, the trial court confirmed the sequence of events as related by the officer. Neither the original order of suppression nor the order denying the State's motion to reconsider questioned the officer's credibility. The traffic stop had not been completed at the time defendant was asked to step out of his vehicle. The balance of the competing interests favored the safety of the officer over the minimal intrusion to an individual directed to step outside of his vehicle after a valid traffic stop. That rationale applied under the Fourth Amendment and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court reversed the order of suppression and remanded the case to the trial court for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An alleged candidate sued defendants, the heads of the branches of state government and an appellate court judge (collectively, the State), challenging the judge's appointment and an impending retention election. The trial court dismissed the case. The candidate appealed to the Tennessee Court of Appeals. He also requested the high court to review the case under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The alleged candidate contended that the Tennessee Plan, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 17-4-101 through 17-4-119 (2009), which provided for the selection and evaluation of state appellate judges, was unconstitutional. He argued that the economic interests of the members of the high court in their respective offices required their disqualification under Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11. The high court held that although the principle of stare decisis appeared to govern the circumstances, and the State made a persuasive argument that res judicata barred the candidate's claims, under former Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 10, Canon 3(E), the high court's participation in the appeal had to be measured against an objective standard for recusal. Under Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7, members of the high court had a protected interest in maintaining their salaries during the course of their terms. As there was an appearance of the members' economic interest in their own compensation, and as the legislature, pursuant to Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11, had authorized both the Governor and chief justice to designate temporary judges, recusal was appropriate under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The members of the high court recused themselves and certified to the Governor the need for the appointment of a special supreme court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After a will was admitted to probate, the Bureau of TennCare filed a claim against the estate, seeking reimbursement for services provided through the TennCare program. The personal representative filed an exception to the claim. The probate court upheld the claim, but the circuit court reversed. The Court of Appeals, Middle Section (Tennessee) held that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction, and vacated the judgment. The estate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The decedent left behind a small estate consisting of some personal property and a house. TennCare sought to recover a sum for nursing home and long-term care services. The circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 30-2-609(b)(2) because the decision did not involve the final settlement of the estate by the personal representative. Instead, the estate was only entitled to appeal to the court of appeals under with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 30-2-315(b). While the court of appeals correctly found that the estate appealed the probate court's decision to the wrong court, it should not have summarily dismissed TennCare's appeal. It should have vacated the circuit court's judgment and remanded the case to the circuit court with directions to transfer the case to the court of appeals in accordance with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-4-108(a)(2). Once the case was properly before it, the court of appeals could then have addressed the substantive issues raised by the parties. On the merits, under both 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396p and Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A child of one of the victims had accused defendant of molesting her; he told three witnesses he killed the victims. He obtained a.22 rifle shortly before the murders; fragments from the bodies were consistent with a.22 bullet. The high court held the trial court erred in admitting evidence of defendant's sexual abuse the child to show motive; because of the inherent unreliability of a witness's recollections of the child's allegations of sexual abuse, defendant's commission of that crime was not proven by clear and convincing evidence. After an officer improperly referred to defendant's refusal to submit to a polygraph, the trial court erred in not providing curative instructions. The prosecutor made improper comments in the opening statement, during the guilt phase of the trial testimony, and in the closing arguments of the guilt and penalty phases. As evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming, the errors did not warrant reversal of the convictions. But because of the improper striking of jurors, the prejudicial error in the admission of evidence, and the improper comments by the prosecution, the verdicts imposing death sentences for each murder could not stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the trial court of two counts of first degree murder, in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202 (1997). Defendant was sentenced to death for each offense as the jury found the aggravating circumstance under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(6) (1997 &amp; Supp. 1999). The Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The victims, husband and wife, were shot to death as they slept in their home. The murders took place days after the minor daughter of one of the victims reported to authorities that she had been sexually abused by defendant, her stepfather. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretionary authority by refusing to change the venue of the trial. However, the court erred by improperly striking jurors, by admitting evidence of a prior claim of child sex abuse, and by allowing references to defendant's refusal to submit to a polygraph examination. Further, several instances of prosecutorial misconduct occurred during the opening statement and during the final arguments of both the guilt and penalty phases of the trial. Because, however, defendant admitted to at least three witnesses that he committed the murders and the evidence of guilt was otherwise overwhelming, the errors had no effect on the verdicts rendered at the conclusion of the guilt phase of the trial. Nevertheless, because certain of the inadmissible evidence was particularly inflammatory and the prosecution made several inappropriate comments, the sentences of death had to be set aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The intermediate appellate court was affirmed in part as to the guilty verdicts for the first degree murders and reversed in part as to the imposition of the death sentences for the murders. The cause was remanded to the trial court for new sentencing hearings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant employer filed an action to reconsider appellee employee's benefits. The employee filed a motion to dismiss, contending that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-6-241(d)(1)(B)(iv) (2008) did not permit an employer to file a reconsideration action. The employer challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which granted the motion to dismiss and found that &sect; 50-6-241 did not violate Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The employee was injured while working for the employer. His workers' compensation claim was settled. As a part of his settlement, he retained a right of reconsideration pursuant to &sect; 50-6-241(d)(1). The employer contended that &sect; 50-6-241 permitted filing of a reconsideration action by an employer and that the statute was unconstitutional. The supreme court held that the trial court correctly held that &sect; 50-6-241(d)(1)(B)(iv) did not permit an employer to file a reconsideration action. The language of &sect; 50-6-241(d)(1)(B)(iv) unambiguously authorized only an employee to file a petition for reconsideration of a prior workers' compensation award or settlement. Because the rights and remedies afforded to both employees and employers by the workers' compensation statutes were adequate substitutes to common-law tort remedies and procedures, &sect; 50-6-241 did not violate the Opens Courts Clause in Tenn. Const, art. I, &sect; 17. It was undoubtedly rational to permit the employee alone to determine whether or not it was in his or her interest to litigate in pursuit of a potential remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner appealed a judgment of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals that affirmed the denial of his motion for post-conviction relief following his two convictions of first-degree felony murder and the imposition of the death penalty, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After reviewing the facts of the case and applying Strickland and its progeny, the court held that defendant was denied the right to a fair trial because of counsel's errors. The failure of defense counsel to adequately investigate and support a motion for the recusal of the presiding trial judge resulted in prejudice to defendant, and defendant was denied the right to a fair trial before an impartial tribunal. The potential injury to the judicial process due to the appearance of impropriety and unfair lack of impartiality by a judge imposing a death sentence was too great to allow the sentence of death to stand. The judge's former role as the prosecutor of defendant on other criminal charges at the same time as his trial for murder, multiple and regular instances of communication between the judge and other prosecutors regarding defendant's criminal cases, and the judge's acquisition of defendant's statement regarding his involvement in the murders compelled a conclusion that Strickland prejudice had been established by, among other things, operation of the denial of due process and the specter of potential unfairness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellee employee filed a retaliatory discharge action against appellant employer under the Tennessee Public Protection Act, Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The employee's amended complaint alleged that she was terminated by the employer for her complaints regarding, and her unwillingness to implement, participate in or remain silent about, discriminatory and illegal policies that the employer's management requested staff members to implement. The supreme court declined to adopt the new Twombly/Iqbal plausibility pleading standard and followed the notice pleading regime. Construing the complaint liberally, presuming all factual allegations to be true and giving the employee the benefit of all reasonable inferences, it was not apparent from the face of the amended complaint that the employee could have proven no set of facts in support of the claim that would have entitled her to relief. The amended complaint specifically referred to the statute upon which the employee was relying to state her claim, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-1-304, and thus comported with Tenn. R. Civ. P. 8.05(1). The amended complaint, while not a model of pleading, provided the employer with sufficient notice of the claims alleged and sufficiently pleaded a legal cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The Court of the Judiciary found that the judge violated Tenn. Sup. Ct.

The supreme court found that &sect; 39-13-203(a)(1) did not require that raw scores on I.Q. tests be accepted at their face value and that the courts could consider competent expert testimony showing that a test score did not accurately reflect a person's functional I.Q. or that the raw I.Q. test score was artificially inflated or deflated.

The jury was presented with the judgment of conviction for that crime. The State also presented evidence that defendant murdered the victim in the instant case during a robbery. The State submitted photographic and testimonial evidence describing the nature and circumstances of the crime, which allowed the jury to assess the weight to be given the proffered aggravating circumstances. In mitigation, the defense presented defendant's personal history, which outlined his abandonment by his birth parents and separation from his siblings at a young age. The jury also heard evidence concerning defendant's almost spotless record while incarcerated. The jury also heard from an expert who opined that defendant had the capacity to do well in the prison environment. The State rebutted that evidence by describing defendant's escape from prison and his prior theft and robbery convictions, both of which were committed after his escape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An attorney filed a motion requesting the court set aside an order directing the Clerk of the Appellate Courts to decline to accept any of his further filings in the case and to rescind its order enforcing the suspension of his license to practice law for 30 days. The attorney also requested that all the members of the Supreme Court of Tennessee, at Nashville recuse themselves due to prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">For nearly two decades, the attorney filed a series of lawsuits in the federal and state courts challenging the financing of elections by officials running for local, state, and federal office. When those actions met with no success, the attorney began challenging the authority of the state appellate courts to hear and decide his claims, alleging the judges were not validly elected. When those challenges failed, he accused the judges who rejected his claims of engaging in unethical and criminal misconduct. The supreme court first concluded that there was no reasonable ground for disqualification of any of the members of the court; among other things, no reasonable person familiar with the practice of law could conclude that the members of the court had any personal interest in the attorney's law license. In addition, the election of a judge was not an adequate basis for disqualification. While supreme court declined to set aside the order directing the Clerk to decline further filings from the attorney, the papers filed prior that order were not effected. Finally, the supreme court concluded that the issue of the attorney's suspension was not in a posture that permitted review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Clerk was directed to accept and file a specified motion filed by the attorney. The attorney's motion for recusal was denied. The attorney was ordered to provide the Clerk with certified copies of the papers he and the Board of Professional Responsibility filed upon seeking judicial review and, within 45 days, file a brief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of aggravated child abuse, in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-15-402 (Supp. 2002), and felony murder by aggravated child abuse, in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202(a)(2) (Supp. 1998). Defendant appealed. The Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee) reversed the conviction for aggravated child abuse, but upheld the felony murder conviction. Both the State and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The General Assembly chose to provide two separate courses of conduct, aggravated child abuse and aggravated child neglect, upon which the felony murder could have been predicated. Under the doctrine of in loco parentis, defendant's failure to seek medical assistance for the victim's injuries may have supported convictions for aggravated child neglect and felony murder by aggravated child neglect, but the State was precluded from charging him with those particular crimes by the terms of an extradition agreement and the doctrine of specialty. Nonetheless, the proof showed that defendant knowingly treated the child in such a manner as to inflict injury, either as principal or as one criminally responsible for the conduct of another. The evidence, even though entirely circumstantial, was sufficient to support the jury's finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of each of the offenses charged. The autopsy report, photographs of the injuries, and defendant's flight from Louisiana and hiding out for three years were especially probative. Further, the trial court's charge to the jury was adequate, and its refusal to supplement the pattern instruction did not constitute reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the conviction for felony murder. It reversed the court of criminal appeals' judgment with regard to the charge of aggravated child abuse, and reinstated defendant's conviction. The sentences imposed by the trial court of life and twenty-two years, respectively, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Department's assessment of excise tax on the taxpayer's capital gains from the stock transaction and reorganization between the taxpayer and its holding company was permissible pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-2004 (Supp. 2000) and the United States Constitution. The earnings at issue were from a one-time, extraordinary transaction. The capital gains did not qualify as business earnings under the transactional test because the earnings did not arise from transactions or activity in the regular course of the taxpayer's ice cream business. However, the capital gains were business earnings pursuant to the functional test provided in &sect; 67-4-2004(1) because the taxpayer's acquisition and sale of the stock contributed materially to the production of business earnings arising from the sale of ice cream. Additionally, the tax assessment was constitutional pursuant to the unitary business principle. The taxpayer and the Department both filed motions for summary judgment. There was no genuine issue of material fact. Accordingly, summary judgment should have been entered in favor of the Department, and not in favor of the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An appeal was permitted of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Tennessee) that plaintiff LaFollette City Council member had standing as a taxpayer, rather than in his official capacity, to seek a declaratory judgment under the Tennessee Open Meetings Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-44-101 to -111 (2002), but reversed an award of attorney fees to him in his action against defendants that included the City of LaFollette and three other Council members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After the trial court temporarily halted budget amendments to support city employee pay raises agreed to in a meeting about which the member filed suit under the Open Meetings Act, the Council met again to approve the pay raises following correct procedure. The trial court then dismissed the member's claim as moot but awarded him fees and costs. On review of the Court of Appeals decision, the court held that the member had standing and was a prevailing party but was not entitled to recover attorney's fees in addition to costs. He failed to demonstrate standing as a taxpayer because there was no indication that he had demanded remedial measures prior to filing suit. However, a threshold showing of an Open Meetings Act violation was sufficient to confer standing to any citizen and lack of public notice in this case was not refuted. While the trial court did not address whether the Act had been violated, its temporary order based on a finding of a violation of the City Charter resulted in a change of the status quo and the member thus was a prevailing party entitled under the American Rule and Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) to costs but not attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the cause to the trial court for entry of an order granting the member costs included in the bill of costs prepared by clerk and discretionary costs.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reduced defendant's attempted first-degree murder sentence and affirmed.

The trial court did not err in denying defendant's right to represent himself because he was using his request to represent himself as a means to challenge the ruling regarding his lead counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of premeditated murder, felony murder, two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of aggravated rape, and two counts of aggravated kidnapping. The trial court merged the premeditated murder and felony murder convictions into a single conviction for which the jury imposed a sentence of death. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his death sentence was disproportionate under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-206. The supreme court disagreed. Defendant and his accomplice hid in the thrift store where the victim was working alone as a clerk and, after raping and robbing her, defendant cut her throat and killed her without provocation or justification. The victim offered no resistance to the offenses committed against her and was obviously helpless in the face of her assailants. Defendant was forty-five years of age at the time of the murder and had a prior criminal history of violent crimes, include convictions for rape and murder. Defendant had an unstable childhood, was of relatively low intelligence, and exhibited brain damage and dysfunction as a result of which he had an abnormally low ability to inhibit aggressive or violent urges. After being approached by law enforcement officers defendant was cooperative and confessed to the crime; however, he did not offer any information regarding his involvement in the murder during the more than five years between the time of the murder and the time of the meeting. The sentence of death was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In plaintiff patient's medical malpractice action defendant surgeon, the trial court granted the surgeon's motion in limine and prohibited the patient from making any reference or suggestion during the trial to any specific sum for any element of non-economic damages or the ultimate monetary worth of the action. The Court of Appeals of Tennessee affirmed. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, the court held that the plain language of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-26-117 (2000) prohibited the patient from disclosing the amount of damages requested in her pleading, but did not preclude her from arguing or suggesting monetary amounts for non-economic damages to jurors at trial, and therefore the trial court erred by granting the surgeon's motion in limine. The court further held that &sect; 29-26-117 and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-9-304 (2009) were not in conflict, and that the statutory scheme allowed a plaintiff to argue or suggest a monetary value to be placed on non-economic damages such as pain and suffering and to make an argument concerning the ultimate monetary worth of his or her action, but precluded either party from disclosing the amount of the ad damnum clause in the plaintiff's complaint. Had the legislature intended to repeal &sect; 20-9-304 in medical malpractice cases, it could have done so as it did with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-9-302 but it did not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant sought review of the appellate court's affirmation of his convictions and sentences for first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and leaving the scene of an accident, but the supreme court further affirmed. The death sentences were not imposed arbitrarily, the evidence supported the jury's finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, and the sentences were not excessive or disproportionate. Although the trial court twice applied Tenn. R. Evid. 615 in a strict manner and prevented defendant from offering his parents' mitigation testimony at sentencing, the jury was still presented with the &quot;essence&quot; of the excluded testimony. While the jury should have been given the opportunity to hear that proof directly from the parents, the jury's verdicts of death would have been the same even had that testimony been allowed. The death sentences were proper because the jury applied multiple aggravating circumstances as to each victim and the jury knew that it was responsible for deciding whether or not to impose the death penalty on defendant for each of the murders he committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff mother brought a wrongful death action against the Tennessee Department of Children's Services (Department) for the death of her son after he was removed from her care and placed in the care of her aunt. The Tennessee Court of Appeals, Eastern Section affirmed the Tennessee Claims Commission's decision that it lacked jurisdiction for the claim pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-307(a)(1)(E) (1999 &amp; Supp. 2009). The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The deceased child and his two brothers were removed from their mother's care because of her cocaine use and, at the mother's request and after an investigation, the Department recommended to the juvenile court that custody of the children be awarded to the mother's aunt. Less than a month later, a case worker investigated the aunt's home at the mother's request and found no basis to remove the children. Ten days later, the five-year-old boy died from extensive injuries allegedly inflicted by the aunt's 19-year-old daughter. The Claims Commission properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the claim because the child was not in the care, custody, and control of the State. When the department closed a case, it no longer retained custody of a minor who was placed with a family member by juvenile court order and had no duty to supervise the home environment of such a placement. The jurisdiction of the Claims Commission was limited to the causes specifically enumerated in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-307(a)(1)(E) (1999 &amp; Supp. 2009).</SPAN></P>

While the trial court was considering the matter on remand, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a contrary decision in United Haulers Ass'n v. Oneida-Herkimer Sold Waste Mgmt. Auth., 550 U.S. 330 (2007). However, the trial court declined to follow the U.S. Supreme Court's intervening decision. The court of appeals relied on the law of the case doctrine and equitable principles when it affirmed. However, the Tennessee's courts were not free to disregard applicable intervening changes in federal constitutional law announced by the U.S. Supreme Court while the case was pending on remand. Accordingly, the United Haulers decision was an intervening change in controlling law for the purposes of the application of the law of the case doctrine. The lower courts' reliance on equitable principles to avoid applying the United Haulers decision was impermissible. Applying the United Haulers decision, the trial court's original order was correct.</SPAN></P>

At the time the injury-producing events occurred, Med was a private charitable institution; five months later, GTLA was amended to transform Med into a governmental entity.

The court granted the plaintiffs' application to appeal, and the plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of legislation extending the coverage of the GTLA to Med on the ground that the legislation had been enacted after the plaintiffs had sustained their injuries. The appellate court agreed and reversed the judgment, having determined that applying the substantive amendment to the GTLA enacted after the injury-producing events occurred to the plaintiffs' damage claims violated the prohibition against retrospective laws in Tenn.

The Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee) affirmed. Defendant was granted permission to appeal to consider the propriety of jury instructions relative to recently stolen property and the sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence to convict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The day following a night burglary in which cash, a computer, car keys, and a car were taken from a residence, the defendant had the car keys in his possession and was driving the car on which he obtained a new title and a loan. The defendant alleged that he bought the car from a woman on the street. The supreme court held that the trial court's jury instructions properly permitted an inference that the defendant committed the burglary, There was a rational connection between the possession and the burglary. The defendant did not request special instructions or supplemental charges. The circumstantial evidence was consistent with the logical inference that the defendant was involved in the theft, either as a knowing receiver of the stolen goods or as the burglar. The trial judge properly denied an acquittal on the burglary charge and that the jury acted within its prerogative in finding the defendant guilty of burglary and rejecting his claim that he purchased the car. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction and the trial court properly permitted jury questions of witnesses pursuant to Tenn. R. Crim. P. 24.1(c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff consumers filed a class action against defendant energy companies pursuant to the Tennessee Trade Practices Act (TTPA), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-25-101 et seq. (2001). The trial court granted the companies' motion, finding that the claims were barred by field preemption and the filed rate doctrine. The consumers appealed. The Court of Appeals, Western Section Chancery Court for Fayette County (Tennessee) reversed. The companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The consumers alleged that the companies engaged in various anticompetitive practices, including making false statements about natural gas transactions and engaging in wash trades and churning. However, the consumers' claims under the TTPA were preempted by the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 717 et seq. (2009), and subsequent federal law. Broad filed preemption was a cardinal feature of natural gas regulation. Field preemption continued to reach transactions that had been deregulated by the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3301 et seq. (2009). The field of preemption not only precluded direct price controls and ratable taking requirements, but extended to many regulations with an indirect bearing on prices. Although plausible arguments were made that in light of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-60, 103 Stat. 157, the consumers' claims were not preempted, the state courts were bound to follow the path set out by the U.S. Supreme Court. As a result, the consumers failed to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted. Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed their complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant property owner filed an application for an extraordinary appeal, after the Court of Appeals (Tennessee) declined.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The city filed a condemnation action but then voluntarily dismissed the complaint to allow time to obtain a certificate of public purpose and necessity as required by Tenn.

The city's answer contained a counterclaim to condemn the property, and the city filed a motion to set aside the voluntary dismissal. After the court granted the owner's application, the city formally abandoned its condemnation efforts and asked that the court dismiss the appeal based on mootness. The court held that the appeal should not be dismissed for mootness and that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss the city's condemnation action because it had been filed before the city obtained the certificate of public purpose and necessity under &sect; 13-16-207(f). The city did not show that the issues had become moot as a result of the voluntary abandonment. Regardless of if the legal issues raised by the owner were moot, the case met the requirements for invoking the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the trial court's orders and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The appellate court reversed defendant's convictions after finding that the evidence was insufficient. The appellate court held that the term willfully in the criminal penalties section of the Tennessee Securities Act of 1980 required that defendant not only had to act deliberately, but also had to be aware that his conduct was prohibited by law. Upon review, the court did not agree. The court held that &sect; 48-2-109 did not require the State of prove that defendant knew his acts were illegal in order to establish a willful violation of Tennessee securities laws. The term willfully in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 48-2-123(a) (1995 and Supp. 2001) required only that defendant acted deliberately and was fully aware of his conduct. Because defendant was aware he was selling securities and knew that he was not registered as a broker-dealer or agent, defendant's convictions should have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The owners agreed to let the company use their property to place equipment and construction materials on their land in exchange for compensation. The company buried old tires, spilled oil and caused blasting damage to their house and vehicles. At trial, the parties stipulated that the company was liable for breach of contract in the amount of $ 5,355.50. A jury then determined that the company was strictly liable for harm caused by its blasting activities in the amount of $ 9,510, and that burying debris on the property constituted a nuisance for which the company was liable for $ 3,305. The jury also returned an award of $ 2 million in punitive damages which the trial court modified to $ 1 million. The appellate court reversed the punitive damages award on the grounds that the trial court improperly considered Tennessee's environmental laws in approving the award. The supreme court found that the evidence supported the jury's award of punitive damages and that the trial court properly considered Tennessee's environmental statutes in approving that award. However, the award was excessive and violated the company's due process rights. As such, the court would modify the award.</SPAN></P>

Under the totality of the circumstances, the police officer's decision to search defendant's residence was not unreasonable. There was no proof that the officer acted for any reason other than the furtherance of legitimate law enforcement concerns. Defendant had been convicted of drug offenses in two states. The officer had information from an informant that she was involved in selling crack cocaine. He verified defendant's parole status and the warrantless search condition before he searched her residence. Neither the search of defendant's vehicle nor that of her residence was unreasonably lengthy. That the total time of defendant's detention might have been at most two hours and included a short trip by defendant in her own vehicle did not so prolong the detention as to make the search unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, dismissed appellee pipeline company's suit for declaratory judgment, challenging the constitutionality of specified portions of the state tax code and seeking an injunction as to the enforcement of those provisions. The Tennessee Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. Appellant State petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State argued that the court of appeals erred by holding that the chancery court had jurisdiction to hear the constitutional challenge without the company first submitting the claim to the Board of Equalization and holding that declaratory judgment was an available remedy against state officers in tax cases. The supreme court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-5-1327 (2006) did not preclude the company's suit for declaratory judgment and was not a barrier to a constitutional challenge to the facial validity of the statute.&nbsp;Section 4-5-225 did not preclude the chancery court from considering a constitutional challenge to the facial validity of a statute even when the agency had not considered a declaratory order. The chancery court improperly dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The company's argument of inherent bias was without merit. The chancery court could issue declaratory and injunctive relief against the State officers in their individual capacity, so long as the judgment was tailored to prevent the implementation of unconstitutional legislation and did not reach the state, its treasury, funds, or property, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-13-102.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In two separate cases, defendants were convicted of multiple offenses and were ultimately given consecutive sentences. The Court of Criminal Appeals Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) affirmed, and defendants appealed, arguing that the trial court's imposition of consecutive sentences violated the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Apprendi and its progeny.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Prior to ordering consecutive sentences, the trial court in each of the cases at hand found the defendant to be a &quot;dangerous offender&quot; for purposes of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-115(b)(4). Under the Apprendi rule, other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum had to be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In rejecting defendants' challenge to their sentences on the basis of the Apprendi rule, the supreme court reasoned that: (1) the principles underlying Apprendi did not apply to consecutive sentences because a judge's decision on how two separate sentences for two distinct crimes should be served was different from the jury's determination of whether the elements of a crime, necessary for a particular sentence, were committed; and (2) the findings supporting defendants' &quot;dangerous offender&quot; status were the types of factors that assisted a judge in determining the manner in which a defendant should serve sentences for multiple offenses, but were not the functional equivalents of elements a jury would consider in determining whether a defendant committed a greater or lesser crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The eighty-two year old victim reported that an unknown assailant raped her in her home. The victim did not testify at trial. Defendant was convicted of aggravated rape. On appeal, he challenged the admission of evidence and the violation of his confrontation rights. The Supreme Court of Tennessee concluded that the State failed to establish a proper chain of custody for the admission into evidence of the victim's pantyhose. The error was not harmless, because the only tangible evidence linking defendant to the victim was the DNA analysis derived from the semen found on the pantyhose. The victim's statements describing the assault to the police officers and her statements to the sexual assault nurse examiner were testimonial and admitted in violation of defendant's right of confrontation. The collection of defendant's blood sample for DNA testing while he was incarcerated for an unrelated offense did not violate his constitutional rights. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion for recusal, based on the mere existence of a friendship between the judge and the assistant district attorney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of theft, aggravated robbery, and premeditated murder and was sentenced to death. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court found that the death sentence was not disproportionate and not arbitrary. Defendant, an estranged boyfriend, murdered an ex-girlfriend, whose testimony had sent him to prison for rape. While he was in prison, he had confided to other inmates his intentions to harm the victim. The threats defendant had made suggested that the murder was a premeditated act of vengeance. That the murder took place shortly after his release from prison buttressed that inference. The proof established that on the night of the murder, defendant sought out the victim at her place of employment, murdered her, and disposed of her body. While the means of her death was not entirely clear, the bloody crime scene indicated that there was a violent struggle. The body was never recovered. Defendant, having a prior criminal record for violent crimes, was convicted on overwhelmingly persuasive circumstantial evidence. Based on the testimony of two prison inmates, he had planned the murder as an act of revenge. He approached the victim at a time when she was most vulnerable - alone and working after midnight at a hotel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant, a juvenile, was adjudicated delinquent for the acts of simple possession or casual exchange of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia after his motion to suppress evidence was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress his statements because he was in custody. The supreme court disagreed. The deputy testified that when she and the vice-principal found defendant prior to searching his truck, she told him about another student and that they were &quot;going out to the vehicle to search the vehicle because of the other student's apparently intoxicated condition.&quot; She said that she did not &quot;tell him&quot; to accompany them, but rather &quot;advised him&quot; of their discovery and &quot;requested that he go with us since it was his vehicle.&quot; The court of appeals looked at the totality of the circumstances, including the language and substance of the request, the fact that the questioning took place in the parking lot and while walking between the school and the parking lot, and that defendant was not confined to the principal's office for questioning. However, with respect to the evidence seized, the parties failed to present sufficient evidence for the trial court to conclude whether the deputy's duties allowed her to conduct a search based upon reasonable suspicion or whether the search should have been based upon probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants challenged a decision from the Davidson County Criminal Court (Tennessee), which convicted them of conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery, facilitation of felony murder, facilitation of especially aggravated robbery, and facilitation of aggravated robbery and imposed the maximum sentence. After the decision was affirmed, the case was heard by the United States Supreme Court, which remanded the case for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After defendants were convicted of various crimes, the maximum sentences were imposed by the trial court. It relied on several aggravating factors under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-114(1), (2), (9) (Supp. 2001). The convictions and sentences were affirmed. However, the United States Supreme Court remanded the case for reconsideration. In vacating the sentences, the Tennessee Supreme Court determined that the trial court was not allowed to impose the maximum sentence without finding aggravating factors. However, the judicial imposition of enhancement factors &sect; 40-35-114(2) and (9) deprived defendants of their Sixth Amendment right to have a jury determine whether those enhancement factors applied. Defense counsel had not waived the right to assert this error; there was no basis for relief under Apprendi until after Blakely was decided. Because the trial court's error adversely affected defendants' unwaived rights to a jury trial, and because the record on appeal did allow a determination of the proper sentences to be imposed, substantial justice required the Tennessee Supreme Court to vacate the sentences. Finally, all of the elements of plain error were established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The sentences were vacated, and the case was remanded for resentencing. In all other respects, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A police officer stopped defendant's vehicle for speeding, frisked him and placed him in the back of his patrol car, and after defendant consented, searched his vehicle and discovered 300 grams of cocaine hidden in the fender. On appeal of the trial court's decision granting defendant's motion to suppress, the court held that even though the initial stop of defendant's vehicle was constitutionally permissible, as he was speeding, the officer's frisking defendant and placing him in the patrol car was not, and therefore the motion was properly granted. The officer had no suspicion that defendant was armed or dangerous, and he did not check the validity of defendant's driver's license or vehicle registration before frisking him or placing him in the patrol car. The record established that the officer placed defendant in the patrol car primarily to determine whether he became more nervous, and the officer's record showed that he conducted &quot;frisks and sits&quot; in other instances regardless of the weather or the time of day.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court determined that, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 32-3-103 (2001), the heir was not &quot;born&quot; subsequent to the execution of the will. The legislature expressed no intent to attach such a liberal construction to the word &quot;born.&quot; The heir had been disinherited by implication. If the testator intended to omit the child from the will, the pretermitted heir statute was inapplicable, regardless of whether the child was legitimate, born out of wedlock, or adopted. Because the decedent, if fully aware of his relationship to the heir, made no effort to adopt or formally to legitimate her after the execution of his will, disinheritance by implication was established. The heir could not prevail on constitutional grounds as the expansive definition of &quot;born&quot; that existed for an adopted child who sought to qualify as a pretermitted heir did not constitute a denial of equal protection. The legitimation issue had to be remanded to the trial court to permit the heir to present her claim pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 31-2-105, the parent-child relationship statute, to demonstrate a relationship to the decedent for purposes of establishing intestate succession rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment of the court of appeals was affirmed where the heir did not qualify as a pretermitted heir; the claim for legitimation was remanded to the chancery court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court excluded the testimony from the victim's father on two grounds: (1) that the testimony was inadmissible hearsay; and (2) that the testimony was inadmissible extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement. The statements had little probative value to implicate another in the crime or to rebut the victim's testimony that oral penetration occurred. In fact, it could be argued that the excluded statements tended to support the prosecution as much they tended to support the defense. Although the statements appeared reliable, they had little probative value to implicate another in the crime or rebut the victim's testimony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff neighbors sued defendants, shooting range owners, leaseholders, a mayor, and a county, alleging that a property reclassification violated a county zoning resolution and Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In 1992, residential property was reclassified to allow a shooting range.

Code Ann. &sect; 13-7-105 applied because (1) the request was presented to a planning commission rather than a board of zoning appeals, and (2) the request to allow a for-profit shooting range on property zoned as residential for single family dwellings substantially affected the use of the land. The ordinance was void ab initio and the statute of limitations was no defense because (1) the county legislative body had no jurisdiction to act on the proposed zoning amendment since the alteration was so substantial that there should have been a resubmission of the proposed amendment to the planning commission, and (2) the record did not establish the requisite public or private reliance for an exception to the application of the void ab initio doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in allowing the State to cross-examine him regarding the circumstances of the crimes. The supreme court agreed. Defendant's statements were simply his attempt at expressing remorse to the victims' families and friends about the crimes that he had already admitted committing. It was troubling that the trial court called the parties to the bench and sua sponte announced that defendant opened the door for the cross-examination. At that time, the State had not yet raised the issue and might never have raised the issue. By finding that defendant's statements of remorse opened the door to full cross-examination on the circumstances of the crimes, the trial court violated defendant's right to avoid self-incrimination. While defendant had already admitted his culpability for the crimes charged by pleading guilty, he still had the constitutional right not to be a witness against himself. While the evidence already before the jury gave them a fairly clear picture of what happened during the attack, hearing such details from third parties did not have nearly the same impact as hearing detailed, graphic descriptions from defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff, the Governor of Tennessee, filed a complaint in the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) against defendant, the Tennessee Judicial Selection Commission, alleging, inter alia, that a second panel submitted by the Commission was not valid under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-4-112(a) as it contained the name of a rejected nominee from the first panel. The court found for the governor, the Commission and intervenors, two judges, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Commission argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in its determination of the appropriate remedy by ordering the Commission to certify and submit to the governor a second panel of nominees, which panel could not include the names of prior nominees. The supreme court agreed. The trial court's remedy unduly restricted the Commission's authority under the Tennessee Plan because the Tennessee Plan left the basic operating procedures to Commission's discretion. Because an ineligible nominee was included on the second panel certified to the Governor, the statutory requirement that the Commission certify &quot;the names of three persons,&quot; Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-4-109(e), was never satisfied; under those circumstances, the panel was void ab initio, and the Commission must reinstitute the selection process for all three nominees to be included on the second panel. Even if the panel was not void ab initio, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-4-109(e), in order to make an informed judgment as to which applicants were the three persons &quot;best qualified and available,&quot; the Commission necessarily must compare each applicant with all of the other applicants who sought to fill the judicial vacancy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">From separate trials, defendant one was found guilty of sexual exploitation of a minor, while defendant two was indicted on the same charge. Both defendants challenged the constitutionality of former Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-1003 (2003). The Tennessee Court of Criminal appeals held that the statute was not unconstitutional, but dismissed 10 of defendant one's 11 convictions as multiplicitous. Both defendant's sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On review, defendants again asserted that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The State contended the appellate court erred by ruling that 10 of defendant one's 11 convictions were multiplicitous. The supreme court found that former Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-1003(b) (2003), which permitted the trier of fact to infer that the image was of a minor, did not alter the requirement that the image be of &quot;a minor.&quot; Thus, this subsection, a permissive inference, was not unconstitutionally overbroad. Further, the statute did not impermissibly shift the burden to defendants to prove that the image did not depict a minor. And because the possession contemplated by the statute had to be &quot;knowing,&quot; a person who inadvertently stumbled upon child pornography would not be guilty of a crime under the terms of the statute. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Finally, the supreme court disagreed with the State's contention and agreed with the appellate court's finding that because the State presented no evidence concerning which pictures came from which website or when defendant one accessed each picture, the evidence established only one crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants, a county, its election commission, and the state administrator of elections, challenged a decision from the Knox County Chancery Court, which entered judgment in favor of plaintiff county commissioners by determining that a county charter and an amendment to such pertaining to term limitations were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The commissioners contended that the county did not properly adopt an alternative form of government. According to them, the term-limit provision amending the charter did not affect their ability to run for office. The chancery court found that the charter and the amendment were invalid, and this appeal followed. In partially reversing, the supreme court held that the charter was not valid because it did not provide for the constitutional county offices or otherwise assign their duties under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5-1-203(b), 5-1-202. Therefore, the charter established a de facto form of government. Under this equitable doctrine, the county government had a valid existence. Moreover, its elected officials, as de facto officers, exercised the traditional duties of their offices. As such, the term limits amendment under Knox County, Tenn., County Charter art. VIII, &sect; 8.17, enacted under the de facto charter, was upheld as a component of the governmental unit. The amendment applied to all elected officials, except for those protected by statute or the state constitution. Under Tenn. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, the county commissioners were subject to term limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The portion of the decision invalidating the charter was affirmed, but the invalidation of the terms limit amendment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

One of defendant's experts admitted that defendant had a previous history of malingering, he had rationally discussed many facets of his case with his attorneys, and he understood the roles of the prosecutor, the judge, and the defense attorneys. Moreover, the trial court applied the correct legal standard: whether defendant had the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants, an employer and its insurer, appealed a decision of the General Sessions Court of Warren County (Tennessee), which denied defendants' motion challenging its subject matter jurisdiction and ultimately found plaintiff claimant to be 88.2% disabled because of a workers' compensation injury pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Law, Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court granted review to determine whether Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-15-5004(c), granting jurisdiction over workers' compensation cases to the General Sessions Court for Warren County, violated Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8. On review, the court upheld the trial court's jurisdiction and the disability award. Even though the Workers' Compensation law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-6-101 et seq., applied uniformly throughout the state and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-6-225(a)(1) conferred jurisdiction of such claims to circuit, criminal, and chancery courts, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-15-5004(c) did not violate Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 98 because there was a rational basis for the classification. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2-506(31)(A), a single judge sat as the chancellor, circuit court judge, and criminal court judge for two counties, and granting the general sessions court jurisdiction over workers' compensation cases more reasonably allocated the caseload among the available judges. The court also found that the evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's findings of disability under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant employers appealed a decision of the Chancery Court Campbell County (Tennessee), which held that the mandatory benefit review conference in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 50-6-203(a), 50-6-225(a)(1), and 50-6-239(b) violated due process under the Tennessee and U.S. Constitutions; the Separation of Powers doctrine of Tenn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The claimants filed separate actions challenging the constitutionality of provisions of the Workers' Compensation Reform Act of 2004. The trial judge concluded that the benefit review conference deprived injured workers of their rights to a trial by judge or an individual otherwise learned in the law. The court reversed and held that the claimants failed to establish that the conference was inconsistent with basic notions of fairness or fair process. Because injured workers were free to file suit and have their rights judicially determined upon exhausting the benefit review process, they were not deprived of their right to be heard by a judge. Nor did the benefit review conference violate substantive due process. The claimants did not show the deprivation of any particular constitutional right, much less a fundamental one. Further, the court was not persuaded that requiring parties to participate in a benefit review conference prior to seeking redress in the courts was an &quot;arbitrary, or conscience shocking&quot; exercise of the legislature's authority to craft the workers' compensation system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A trial court determined that appellant biological father was the legal father of a child. On appeal, the Court of Appeals Juvenile Court for Coffee County (Tennessee) reversed, and held that the biological mother's husband was the child's legal father under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-2-304(a). The biological father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The mother engaged in an extramarital affair with the biological father and became pregnant. The mother and her husband remained married after she revealed her affair and the husband held the child out to the world as his child despite DNA tests to the contrary. The biological father subsequently petitioned to establish his parentage, custody, visitation, and child support; the mother and her husband petitioned to terminate the biological father's parental rights. The appellate court held that the husband was the child's legal father based on the best interests of the child. On appeal, the court reversed. Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-2-302, 24-7-112, the biological father was the legal father of the child, absent the termination of his rights. A best-interests analysis was relevant if an only if termination was appropriate. The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the evidence did not support the arguments of the mother and her husband that the biological father willfully failed to visit or support the child. The evidence showed that the mother actively concealed the child's parentage and that the mother declined the biological father's offer of support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment reversing the trial court's decision that the father was the child's legal father was reversed, and the child support order was modified. The case was remanded to the juvenile court for a calculation of child support and retroactive child support consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court held that &sect; 40-35-321 was constitutional as applied to the first defendant, and therefore the trial court did not err by denying his motion to suppress, because the blood draw and its subsequent analysis were reasonable under all of the circumstances, which included the facts that: (1) the gravity of the public concern served by the searches was significant, given that DNA more accurately identified those who committed and were convicted of felonies; (2) &sect; 40-35-321 clearly and unambiguously specified who was subject to the searches; (3) no measure of individualized suspicion was necessary because the searches were not aimed at recovering incriminating evidence of contemporaneous criminal conduct; and (4) the convicted felons subject to search had a significantly reduced expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, organizations, citizens, and three members of the Tennessee House of Representatives, filed a complaint in the Davidson County Chancery Court, Tennessee, against defendants, state officials, seeking to enjoin the Secretary of State from including the Marriage Amendment to Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs argued that Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3 provided a mandatory sequential process that could only be satisfied by literal compliance, and that the failure to publish the Marriage Amendment six months prior to the 2004 election constituted a deviation from the constitutional mandates and precluded it from appearing on the November 7, 2006 ballot. The supreme court found that plaintiffs failed to establish a distinct, concrete injury in fact resulting from the alleged untimely publication of the Marriage Amendment. Plaintiffs failed to establish that the alleged untimely publication impaired their right to vote in the 2004 election or precluded them from supporting candidates in the 2004 election who opposed the Marriage Amendment. Plaintiffs' sexual orientation and interest in same gender marriage were not relevant to their claim that the Marriage Amendment was not published in accordance with art. XI, &sect; 3. The legislator plaintiffs failed to establish that the effectiveness of their vote or any of their other legislative powers was impeded by the alleged untimely publication.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner inmate sought post-conviction relief under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-101 et seq., from his murder convictions and death sentences. He appealed an order of the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) setting forth a procedure for determining competency to proceed at the post-conviction level and adopting the Nix standard for mental incompetence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The inmate was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death. He sought post-conviction relief, and his counsel claimed that he was incompetent. The trial court's order set forth a procedure for determining the inmate's competency and granted him an interlocutory appeal under Tenn. R. App. P. 9. On appeal, the court held that the civil standard for mental incompetence adopted in State v. Nix, applied to a competency determination during post-conviction proceedings. To trigger a hearing on competency, the inmate had to make a prima facie showing of incompetence by submission of affidavits, depositions, medical reports, or other credible evidence. The inmate bore the burden of proving that he was incompetent by clear and convincing evidence. A finding of incompetence required neither a stay of the post-conviction proceedings nor abeyance of individual issues; the trial court should appoint, if necessary, a &quot;next friend&quot; or guardian ad litem to pursue the action on behalf of the inmate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order was modified such that rather than a bifurcated procedure that would hold factual claims that required a petitioner's input in abeyance pending his return to competency, a next friend or guardian ad litem would be appointed to pursue the action on the petitioner's behalf. As modified, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Although there was only one victim, defendant committed separate and distinct acts; his act of murder, which he committed by employing another to commit the murder for remuneration or the promise of remuneration, was separate and distinct from defendant's entering into an agreement with his accomplice to have his wife killed. In addition, defendant's agreement with his accomplice to have his wife killed was separate and distinct from the act satisfying the aggravating circumstance of Tenn.

On appeal, the court held that the prosecutors' knowing use of his confession, which contained many facts known to be false, did not violate defendant's due process rights because due process merely required the trial court to find that defendant confessed voluntarily and that the confession was minimally corroborated. Once the two conditions were satisfied, the truth or falsity of the confession was a determination for the jury. The trial court found that defendant's confession was voluntary, and defendant did not challenge that finding on appeal. The confession was sufficiently corroborated by numerous witnesses. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the State prosecuted defendant and his accomplice using inconsistent theories, facts, and arguments in violation of his due process rights because defendant's &quot;lone perpetrator&quot; characterization of his accomplice's prosecution was false. The core theory of the two prosecutions was consistent, namely that the accomplice shot the victims and robbed the store while defendant served as a lookout.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Circuit Court for Shelby County, Tennessee, found that it was without jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief in favor of appellant adult-oriented businesses on a declaratory judgment challenging the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-51-1402 and seeking an injunction against appellee city to prevent its enforcement. The court of appeals found that the trial court erred in ruling on the constitutional claims. The businesses appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The city argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to issue a temporary injunction enjoining enforcement of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-51-1402. The supreme court noted that when the businesses sought an injunction against the enforcement of the statute, they were requesting that the circuit court, acting as a court of equity, enjoin enforcement of a criminal statute. The general rule that courts of equity lacked jurisdiction to enjoin enforcement of a criminal statute that was alleged to be unconstitutional equally applied to the circuit court. The supreme court refused to presume that the State would harass the businesses and their employee by continuing to prosecute them under the statute if it was found to be invalid or inapplicable during the first prosecution brought to trial. The businesses did not present evidence demonstrating that absent the injunction, the value of their property would be destroyed or it would deteriorate. The trial court did not order consolidation or provide notice to the parties of its intent to consolidate the hearings as required by Tenn. R. Civ. P. 65.04(7). The trial court erred in addressing the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-51-1402.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment of the court of appeals was affirmed and the case remanded to the trial court for a hearing on the merits with regard to the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Tennessee Court of Appeals, Western Section, awarded plaintiffs, members of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners, summary judgment on their declaratory judgment action against defendants, County of Shelby, the Shelby County Election Commission, and Shelby County Election Commissioners, that term limits was unauthorized under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The members argued that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-210(4) did not authorize the imposition of term limits upon members of a county legislative body. The members argued that Tenn. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 prohibited limiting the number of terms a county legislative official may serve. The supreme court found that there was nothing in the language of the constitution to prevent a county from placing a limit on the number of terms that may be served. The term limits were a qualification for holding office within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-210(4). It followed that Shelby County, Tenn., Charter &sect; 2.03(G) was authorized by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-210(4). If the delegates had wanted to prohibit term limits as the members contended, they could have easily added language to that effect. The members did not establish that &sect; 5-1-210(4) was constitutionally defective. The constitution specifically authorized legislation creating different forms of local government, and the General Assembly had very broad powers and discretion in this regard. Defendants' request for an order delaying the election was denied.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-307(b) (2005), barring a federal or state cause of action arising from the same act or omission as the claim before the Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner professor filed a lawsuit against respondent university alleging a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e, based on gender and national origin discrimination. She also alleged a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The university claimed that the professor's claim for breach of contract filed with the Commission barred her suit in district court, even though the Commission dismissed it without prejudice. The Tennessee Supreme Court determined that, pursuant to Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 23, it may answer certified questions consistent with the inherent power of the supreme court and with the responsibility to protect the sovereignty of the state. Because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-307(b) provided that the &quot;filing&quot; of a claim operated as a waiver, the fact that the professor's claim was later voluntarily dismissed was irrelevant; the waiver became operational at the time of filing. The supreme court declined to answer additional questions posed by the professor as they were outside the scope of the question certified to the supreme court by the district court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant not only agreed to speak with an officer, but he also signed an advice and waiver of rights form. Furthermore, defendant reviewed the statement and initialed and signed the beginning and end of each page. On two separate occasions defendant elected to forgo the assistance of counsel and instead chose to speak directly to law enforcement officials concerning his role in the murder. Defendant actually requested a second interview with the detectives to clarify his previous statement.

On appeal, the supreme court affirmed, stating that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction and the fact that the murder was committed during the perpetration of a rape. By his own admission, defendant lured the victim into the woods and did not intend for her to leave the woods alive. Once in the woods, the victim was stabbed 16 times and left to die. A jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant's admission to having sex with the victim was his way of explaining any DNA that might have been found on the victim, thereby linking defendant to her rape. His death sentence was appropriate because the proof was sufficient to support the existence of serious physical abuse in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(5). In addition to being stabbed 16 times, the victim suffered defensive wounds to her wrist and three of the wounds, those to the neck, were each sufficient to cause her death.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee) that affirmed his conviction of first-degree premeditated murder, two counts of first-degree felony murder, especially aggravated kidnapping, rape of a child, and two counts of criminal impersonation in connection with the 1996 abduction, rape, and murder of a nine-year-old girl.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant challenged the denial of his motion to suppress and the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions for first-degree murder, kidnapping, and rape, and to support the aggravating circumstances. The court held that defendant's rights were not violated by the admission of the statements, which were obtained from defendant after he failed a polygraph examination and his status became custodial, because defendant was advised of his Miranda rights and made a knowing and voluntary waiver of those rights earlier in the day and the 5 hours between defendant's waiver of his Miranda rights and his subsequent custodial interrogation did not constitute a significant time lapse. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's first-degree murder conviction where there was no evidence to support his claim that he accidentally ran over the victim because her body showed no signs of trauma and there was no evidence to support his claim that her brother sexually assaulted her. The court also found that defendant's sentence was not arbitrary and that the evidence supported the jury's findings with respect to the four aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant had not requested an instruction on facilitation of second degree murder, and none was given. The trial court denied his motion for a new trial in which he had not raised the omission of the instruction on the lesser-included offense of facilitation of second degree murder. The Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee) reversed his conviction for second degree murder. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State asserted that the court of criminal appeals erred in finding Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-18-110(c)&nbsp;unconstitutional because the statute did not preclude lesser-included offense instructions; it merely established reasonable procedures for invoking the right to those instructions. The State urged the Supreme Court of Tennessee to assume that defendant had waived the right to an instruction on facilitation for tactical reasons, a decision which would have bound him. The supreme court concluded that &sect;&nbsp;40-18-110(c) rendered the omission of the instruction on lesser-included offenses subject to the general rule that issues concerning instructions were considered waived in the absence of objection or a written request, unless they contained plain error. The failure to instruct on lesser-included offenses in the instant case did not constitute plain error. At trial, defendant failed to request a lesser-included offense instruction on facilitation of second degree murder and failed to show that he had not waived that issue for tactical reasons. Therefore, the trial court's failure to instruct on facilitation of second degree murder did not rise to the level of plain error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment of the court of criminal appeals was reversed and defendant's conviction for second degree murder was reinstated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner inmate appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Tennessee), which affirmed the trial court's holding that Tennessee's lethal injection protocol was not cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution or Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The inmate filed an action under the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act (UAPA) challenging respondent department of corrections' lethal injection protocol. The court affirmed and held that there was overwhelming evidence that lethal injection was consistent with contemporary standards of decency and that Tennessee's protocol was consistent with the majority of lethal injection protocols used by other states and the federal government. There was testimony that although injection of two of the drugs would alone cause extreme pain, a dosage of a third would cause nearly immediate unconsciousness and that the inmate would feel no pain prior to death. Also, the inmate failed to cite authority or otherwise make a persuasive argument that the adoption of the lethal injection protocol violated procedural due process. The court also held that respondent's disciplinary procedures were not &quot;rules&quot; as defined by the UAPA because they fit squarely into the exceptions under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-102(10)(A), (G). Also the protocol did not violate the Nonlivestock Animal Humane Death Act, and the protocol fell outside the licensing statute applicable to healthcare providers.</SPAN></P>

The trial and appellate courts found in favor of the mother, and the supreme court affirmed on separate grounds, stating that the mother was the children's legal mother with all the rights and responsibilities of parenthood. The court stated that Tennessee's parentage and related statutes did not provide for or control the circumstances of the case. Those statutes simply did not apply to all conceivable parentage determinations. Although giving birth was conspicuously absent from Tennessee's parentage statutes, there was no indication that the General Assembly sought to exclude it as a basis for legal maternity, or even sought to decide questions of maternity at all, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-2-302, 36-2-305, 36-1-102 (2001). Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff New York company appealed the judgment from the Court of Appeals (Tennessee), which on review from defendant companies' successful motion to dismiss plaintiff's Tennessee Trade Practices Act (TTPA), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-25-101 et seq. (2001), claim and their unsuccessful motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim, modified the judgment to hold that the TTPA was not applicable to indirect purchasers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff was an end-user of food products containing sorbates and purchased such products in supermarkets in New York. As an indirect purchaser of sorbates, it filed a lawsuit against defendants, claiming a violation of the TTPA and unjust enrichment, based on defendants' guilty pleas to fixing the prices of sorbates in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1. The trial court dismissed the claims, and the court of appeals affirmed, adding that the TTPA was not applicable to indirect purchasers such as plaintiff. On review, the court found that contrary to the court of appeals' holding, the plain language of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 47-25-101 and 47-25-102 (2001) did not prohibit recovery to indirect purchasers who were nonresidents of Tennessee. However, the court found that because defendants' illegal price fixing did not substantially affect Tennessee commerce, it fell outside the scope of the TTPA. Lastly, because plaintiff failed to provide a factual basis to support its bare allegation that any attempt to exhaust its remedies would have been futile, the trial court erred in failing to grant defendants' motion for summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the dismissal of the TTPA claim, but modified the judgment to provide that although an indirect purchaser could bring an action under the TTPA, the conduct at issue fell out of the scope of the TTPA. The reversed the judgment denying defendants summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant city was granted an injunction enjoining appellee adult bookstore from operating its store in alleged violation of the location requirement of Knoxville, Tenn., City Code &sect; 16-468(a). The Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Knoxville reversed on the grounds that the ordinance's definition of adult bookstores was unconstitutionally vague and the case was remanded for a determination of damages. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The parties disputed whether the phrase &quot;substantial or significant portion of its stock and trade,&quot; used to define adult bookstores, was impermissibly vague. The supreme court found that it was. First, the inability of the officers charged with enforcing the ordinance to define its key terms weighed heavily against the ordinance's constitutionality. As written, the determination of what constituted a &quot;substantial or significant portion&quot; of a business's &quot;stock and trade&quot; was an entirely subjective one. The ordinance gave no objective guidance to businesses regulated by the ordinance or officials charged with its enforcement. Second, the terms as used in the context of the ordinance could not be defined with any degree of precision. The fact that the terms &quot;substantial&quot; and &quot;significant&quot; were common and familiar terms did not support the argument that they were constitutional as used in the ordinance. Third, the city declined to give any limiting construction to the ordinance, and the supreme court was unable to impose a narrowing definition to salvage its constitutionality. The absence of any ascertainable standard was precisely what offended the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment of the court of appeals was affirmed. The case was remanded to the chancery court to assess the amount of the bookstore's damages and to determine the propriety of awarding attorney's fees as a result of the chancery court's injunction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that defendant suffered from a brain injury and had difficulties communicating at times. The trial court further found, however, that defendant understood the nature of the proceedings, understood the charges against him, and communicated with his attorneys by suggesting defenses. The fact that not all of defendant's defense strategies or suggestions were pursued did not indicate that he lacked the ability to assist in his defense. In short, the trial court heard the evidence and accredited the testimony of the experts. Therefore, the trial court properly found that defendant was competent to stand trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The employee argued that the trial court erred by holding that she could not recover for the aggravation of her lung condition caused by exposure at work. Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-6-301, the trial judge found that the employee had not come close in showing that she had an occupational disease in reference to exposure to the chemicals. The appellate court found that the employee did not prove the six elements of an occupational disease by a preponderance of the evidence. There was evidence that the employee's breathing condition existed before working for the employer and was unrelated to any occupational hazard. The medical testimony failed to demonstrate the necessary casual connection between her deteriorating condition and the employer's chemicals. The employee had a severe condition before working. Expert evidence failed to prove the duration and extent of her exposure to specific harmful chemicals was sufficient to cause a permanent aggravation of her pre-existing conditions. Her condition was not typical of occupational injuries. The legislature was within its constitutional authority when it decided to alter the jurisdiction of the general sessions court.</SPAN></P>

The court of criminal appeals affirmed both the conviction and sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed because the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The trial court did not err in limiting the testimony of a forensic psychiatrist at the sentencing hearing. The trial court did not commit reversible error when it refused to instruct on defendant's &quot;history of abuse and neglect&quot; as a non-statutory mitigating circumstance. The State of Tennessee did not improperly rely upon aggravating circumstance &sect;&nbsp;39-13-204(i)(6) to support the death penalty.

Immediately after each detective testified about the statement, the trial court provided a cautionary instruction to the jury, limiting the jury's consideration of the testimony about the statement to the issue of whether the conspiracy existed and forbidding its consideration as to whether a particular defendant joined in the charged conspiracy. Moreover, the other properly-admitted evidence of guilt was substantial. An eyewitness identified defendant from a photographic array and again at trial, testifying that she was &quot;very sure&quot; of the identification. Fingerprint evidence placed defendant at the scene, and his girlfriend testified extensively about defendant's involvement in the crime.</SPAN></P>

The evidence at trial revealed that defendant shot the victim, an armored truck guard, in the back of the head and stole the victim's money deposit bag. Defendant was identified as one of two men fleeing from the scene, his criminal conduct was filmed by a surveillance camera, and the videotape of the crime was played for the jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner inmate appealed a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee), which affirmed the trial court's denial of the inmate's motion to reopen his petition for post-conviction relief that alleged that the inmate was mentally retarded under Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The inmate was sentenced to death. A psychologist testified that the inmate's level of intellectual functioning was within the retarded range of intelligence. The court held: (1) Section 39-13-203(a) (2003) was not intended to apply to a &quot;range&quot; of IQ scores; (2) the inmate's motion should be reviewed applying the colorable claim standard; (3) the inmate was confronted with circumstances beyond his control that prevented him from previously challenging his conviction and sentence on constitutional grounds. For these reasons, the court found the individual's individual interests to outweigh those of the State under the specific facts; (4) applying the &quot;clear and convincing&quot; burden of proof to petitioners, such as the inmate, who were for the first time, in a petition for post-conviction relief or a motion to reopen post-conviction proceedings, able to raise a claim of mental retardation to avoid capital punishment violated their due process rights at an evidentiary hearing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of one count of sexual battery by an authority figure, six counts of sexual battery, and three counts of assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in joining several counts in a single action. The supreme court agreed. Because the offenses were not &quot;signature&quot; crimes or part of a larger, continuing plan or conspiracy, the offenses alleged against defendant did not constitute a common scheme or plan and the trial court erred in denying the defendant's motion to sever the offenses for trial. The offenses were not so factually unique or distinctive as to constitute defendant's modus operandi. While there were certainly similarities among the allegations, those similarities were simply that all of the incidents were sexual assaults by a physician against a patient. Even though defendant was alleged to have touched the women in a sexual manner while examining them in his office, the circumstances of each encounter were not so unique and distinctive as to allow one to conclude that if defendant committed one offense, then he also must have committed the other offenses as well. Therefore, the offenses did not evidence a distinctive design nor were they &quot;signature&quot; crimes of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State filed an application for permission to appeal a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee), which reversed defendant's conviction for premeditated first-degree murder and his sentence of death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The appellate court held that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on facilitation and solicitation of first-degree premeditated murder and especially aggravated kidnapping. The court held that the appellate court erred in reversing defendant's conviction and sentence because the trial court had not erred by failing to instruct the jury on facilitation and solicitation. The evidence unmistakably established either the completed offenses of murder and especially aggravated kidnapping or defendant's claim of innocence. No reasonable jury could have concluded from the evidence presented that defendant had the knowledge required for facilitation but lacked the intent required for criminal responsibility. The trial court did not err by permitting the medical examiner to display the victim's cleaned and reconstructed skull as a demonstrative aid during his testimony because defendant failed to show unfair prejudice that outweighed the evidence's probative value. The State did not present inconsistent theories and evidence in the separate trials of defendant and a codefendant. Finally, the sentence of death was not disproportionate or excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In a divorce action between appellant father and appellee mother, the trial court rejected proposed parenting plans, effectively granted primary physical custody of the parties' children to the father, and ordered the mother to pay child support. The Tennessee Court of Appeals reversed, divided child custody between the parties equally, but ordered the father to pay child support. The instant court granted the father permission to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The father and the mother were in agreement as to equal parenting time. The Tennessee Supreme Court first rejected the father's assertion that the income of both parents should have been considered in calculating the child support award. Under Tenn. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. 1240-2-4-.03(2), the income of the parent with whom the children primarily lived was not to be considered in the calculation of child support. However, the primary issue on appeal was whether child support could be awarded when neither party had been designated the primary residential parent. The supreme court noted that the Tennessee Child Support Guidelines contemplated that child support could be awarded only to the primary residential parent. Moreover, other state and federal statutes required that one parent be named a child's custodian. Thus, the court of appeals erred in failing to designate a primary residential parent and in awarding child support without designating same. Consequently, a remand was necessary. The trial court was directed to consider all of the relevant statutory factors in designating a primary residential parent, in calculating child support, and in entering a parenting plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The matter was remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the supreme court's opinion. Costs on appeal were taxed equally to the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In refusing to grant injunctive relief, the trial court concluded that the commission had the authority to refuse to place the ordinance on the ballot; it also found that the ordinance would have been unconstitutional because it would have unlawfully increased the taxing power of the city. On review, the city argued that the commission and the coordinator were ministerial officials who had no authority to refuse to place the ordinance on the ballot because they believed it to be unconstitutional. The appellate court agreed, concluding that determining the substantive constitutionality of such measures was a function reserved for the judiciary. Regardless of whether the ordinance would have been unconstitutional, the coordinator and the commission violated the constitutional principles of separation of powers by refusing to place the ordinance on the ballot. Further, a challenge to the substantive validity of the ordinance was not ripe for judicial determination, as the ordinance was not yet approved by the voters.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The evidence, when examined in the light most favorable to the State, was sufficient to support a finding of premeditation. Defendant inflicted multiple wounds upon each victim during the particularly cruel killings. He used two weapons - scissors and a ligature - on each of the unarmed victims and attempted to dispose of evidence by flushing his underwear down the toilet. Defendant exhibited calmness after the murders by showering, changing his clothes, looking for valuables, and then driving to Missouri where he socialized with friends at a tavern that night. Although defendant made no prior threats or declarations of intent to kill the victim's, he told a witness that he had always had a secret fantasy of committing multiple rapes and homicides. Even without that testimony, however, the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant acted with premeditation when he killed the victims to obtain the means of facilitating his flight and to prevent them from alerting the police.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court also affirmed, finding that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdicts, as it showed that defendant had said that the victims would have to be killed because they knew who defendant and his accomplices were and where they lived, and, shortly before the offenses, defendant obtained a nine millimeter handgun that was used in the shootings. Also, defendant and his accomplice were seen driving the victims' car on the night of the offenses with the victims tied up in it and were in possession of guns and the victim's personal clothing and jewelry.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted for the murders, kidnappings, and robberies of the two victims. Defendant and his co-defendant killed the victims after robbing them of weapons they had arranged to purchase. On appeal, the court held that the indictment against defendant was not constitutionally defective due to the fact that it failed to charge the aggravating circumstances relied on by the State to sentence him to death, because the court had consistently rejected the argument that aggravating circumstances had to be pled in the indictment. The court also held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(c), the evidentiary standard used during sentencing, did not violate the due process or confrontation clauses of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of first-degree premeditated murder, as the evidence showed that defendant and his co-defendant decided to rob the victims instead of paying for the weapons, defendant was overheard saying that, if they robbed the victims, they would have to kill them, because they knew defendants, and they carried handcuffs, rope, and duct tape to the meeting.</SPAN></P>

Section 39-13-204(c) (1998) was not to be applied to cases occurring before its effective date. The trial court's erroneous application of the 1998 amendment led directly to the prosecution's introduction of detailed and graphic evidence of prior violent felonies committed by defendant. The law as it existed at the time of the offense prohibited such evidence. Moreover, the prosecution heavily relied upon the inadmissible evidence underlying defendant's prior felonies in arguing that the jury should impose the death penalty for defendant's offense. In short, under the circumstances, the error was not harmless because it affected the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant challenged a decision of the Circuit Court for Coffee County (Tennessee), which denied defendant a hearing on the issue of his competency to be executed. Also before the court were (1) a motion by defendant to vacate the trial court's order and remand for designation of another judge, (2) a motion to reconsider the court's previous denial of a motion to withdraw by defendant's co-counsel, and (3) a motion requesting a stay of execution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant had been convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. He sought a hearing on the issue of his competency to be executed, but the trial court denied the request. The court affirmed. The court refused to reconsider its prior decision denying defendant's co-counsel's motion to withdraw because there was nothing requiring withdrawal. The court refused to remand the matter for the designation of another judge. A judge's recusal in defendant's post-conviction case did not disqualify him from presiding in this competency proceeding. The court refused to grant a stay. The trial court did not err in concluding that defendant failed to make a threshold showing sufficient to have warranted a hearing on his competency petition. The reports of defendant's mental health experts showed that, despite any delusions, defendant understood that he was going to be executed for murdering the victim. While defendant professed unorthodox views about what was going to happen after his execution, these beliefs did not vitiate defendant's awareness of the fact of his execution and the reason for it. Thus, no issues existed regarding his competency to be executed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff hospital authority sought a declaration that it had the authority to enter into an exclusive contract for professional imaging services.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The radiologists applied for a certificate of need to perform outpatient diagnostic imaging services in competition with the hospital. The hospital authority's board of trustees decided to oppose the certificate of need application. The medical staff of the hospital voted to support the radiologists' company in becoming the providers of radiology services under an exclusive provider contract if an agreement could be reached. The company objected to several provisions in the request for a proposal. The hospital authority filed an action for declaratory judgment seeking a declaration of the right of the hospital to close the staff of its imaging department by means of an exclusive provider contract. The appellate court found that the Hospital Authority Act permitted the hospital authority to close the staff of the hospital's imaging department by means of an exclusive provider contract. Also, the board's decision to close the staff of the hospital's imaging department did not violate the medical staff bylaws. Finally, the radiologists were not legally or constitutionally entitled to a hearing if their clinical privileges were terminated upon the execution of such a contract.</SPAN></P>

Given the confusion regarding the proper standard to apply in determining when lesser-included offense instructions were required, it was unclear whether the omitted issue would have resulted in reversal on appeal if it had been raised. In light of the facts of the case and the precedent available at the time of the appeal, the supreme court could not conclude that the omitted issue was &quot;clearly stronger&quot; than those presented. Trial counsel objected to the trial court's failure to instruct on lesser-included offenses, although he was not required to do so. Appellate counsel testified at length about the strategy on appeal. In determining what issues to raise, counsel chose those issues that were most likely to achieve success.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was granted a delayed direct appeal of a first degree murder conviction due to trial counsel's failure to file a motion for a new trial that resulted in a waiver of issues on direct appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeals Circuit Court for Stewart County (Tennessee) dismissed defendant's subsequent appeal, concluding that the trial court lacked the authority to grant that form of postconviction relief. Defendant appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Contrary to the lower court's conclusion, defendant could have received a delayed appeal under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-30-113(a)(1) &amp; (3) and 40-30-111(a) if he had been denied ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment or Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. In this case, trial counsel's failure to file a timely motion for a new trial and withdraw to allow defendant to file a pro se motion was deficient performance as that failure resulted in the waiver of post-trial and appellate remedies and violated counsel's duties under Tenn. R. Crim. P. 37(e). The fact that defendant was entitled to direct review on the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence did not resolve the prejudice prong of the Strickland test as nothing in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-113 limited the trial court's discretion to order a delayed direct appeal to circumstances where there was a complete denial of such an appeal. Defendant was not required to show actual prejudice because counsel's failure to preserve and pursue available post-trial remedies was presumptively prejudicial. Thus, counsel's deficiencies post-trial amounted to a complete failure to subject the State's case to appellate scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The lower court's judgment was reversed, the trial court's grant of a delayed appeal was affirmed, and the case was remanded to the lower court for review of the issues presented by defendant's appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial. Costs were taxed to the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioners, adoptive parents, filed an action to terminate the parental rights of respondent father, on the basis that he abandoned the subject child, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-102(1)(A)(i). The Chancery Court for Shelby County, Tennessee, entered an order for termination. The Tennessee Court of Appeals affirmed and found the father's failure to pay support as an additional ground for termination. By permission, the father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The mother's parental rights were already terminated, largely as a consequence of her cocaine addiction. The Tennessee Supreme Court held that only a parent's conduct in the four months immediately preceding the filing of a petition then before the trial court could be used as grounds to terminate parental rights under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-102(1)(A)(i). As there was no dispute that the father paid child support and visited the child in the four months preceding the filing of the petition, the lower courts erred in terminating the father's parental rights based upon &sect; 36-1-102(1)(A)(i). Further, the court of appeals erred in terminating the father's rights based upon Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-102(1)(A)(iii) (relevant to paying reasonable support), because the court of appeals did not address the required element of willfulness. Moreover, the trial court, not the court of appeals, was the proper court to make a determination of willfulness pursuant to &sect; 36-1-102(1)(A)(iii). Finally, the trial court failed to address each ground for termination of parental rights that was asserted. Thus, a remand on the issue of abandonment and any other grounds for termination was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The decision of the court of appeals was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings, consistent with the supreme court's decision.</SPAN></P>

Sup. Ct. R. 9, &sect; 25, and, if so, by whom and before what tribunal. The state court determined that, inter alia: (1) the confidentiality requirement applied to a layperson who filed a complaint against an attorney with the Board; (2) an appropriate sanction for a violation of Rule 9, &sect; 25 was an action for contempt; (3) an action for contempt may be initiated by any person whose rights under Rule 9, &sect; 25 were violated; (4) the Supreme Court of Tennessee or the Board could pursue an action for contempt; and (5) a charge of contempt was to be filed first with the Supreme Court of Tennessee, whereupon assignment shall issue to special master to make findings of fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant mother filed a petition for contempt against appellee father for his failure to comply with a child support agreement. The Court of Appeals Juvenile Court for Knox County, Tennessee, agreed with the trial court and held that Tenn. Dep't Human Serv. Child Support Guidelines, ch. 1240-2-4-.03(4) violated the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The mother brought a contempt action against the father, as he failed to comply with an agreed judgment regarding child support and also requested an increase in child support. The father responded by arguing that the Tennessee Department of Human Services Child Support Guidelines (Guidelines) were unconstitutional and violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions, as they prohibited consideration of non-court ordered child support and required only consideration of the obligor's income in calculating support. The state supreme court reversed the court of appeals and held, as the Guidelines did not impact a fundamental right, the court's inquiry was whether the Guidelines bore a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose and were neither arbitrary nor discriminatory. The state supreme court held that: (1) the Guidelines did not violate the equal protection and due process provisions of either the United States or Tennessee Constitutions; and (2) the promulgation of the Guidelines did not constitute an impermissible delegation of rulemaking authority by the Tennessee General Assembly to the Tennessee Department of Human Services.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the procedures leading to defendant's identification did not violate his due process rights as no State action was involved in the witnesses' identification of defendant from television coverage. The search warrants' descriptions of the character of the property being sought satisfied the particularity requirement. The affidavits set forth sufficient facts from which it reasonably could have been concluded that a nexus existed between the crime and the place to be searched; the facts were sufficiently recent to establish probable cause. The evidence was sufficient to support the convictions where: defendant had discussed robbing fast-food restaurants with co-workers; the victims were shot execution-style while lying on the floor; one of the victim's identification was recovered with defendant's fingerprints; and witnesses identified defendant. The victim impact testimony offered by the victims' family members was not unduly prejudicial. The sentences of death were not imposed arbitrarily and were not excessive or disproportionate, considering the nature of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In this workers' compensation case, the Supreme Court of Tennessee was called upon to determine whether the trial court properly admitted a C-32 form medical report obtained by the claimant, an injured employee, by the defendant employer's consulting expert, a physician who made a court ordered physical examination of the injured employee. The trial court admitted the medical report, and the employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

As a result of his employment, he suffered from depression, sleeplessness, and constant disabling pain, which prevented him from performing many day-to-day activities. The employer requested a court ordered independent medical examination by a neurologist. The motion was granted, and the examination was performed. The claimant filed a notice that he would file the doctor's form C-32 medical report, to be used as evidence under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-6-235(c)(1). The employer objected, claiming Tenn. R. Civ. P. 26.02(4)(B) protected from discovery the opinion of a consulting expert who would not be called as a witness. However, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 50-6- 204(f) and 50-6-235(c) specifically permitted admission of the testimony, including a medical report form, of an examining physician paid for by the employer in a workers' compensation case. Therefore, the instant court held, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 50-6-204(f) and 50-6-235(c), that the trial court properly admitted the physician's medical report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The case at bar was the third plaintiff teachers' suit challenging the constitutionality of the manner in which the State funded public education. The question was whether the State's current method of funding salaries for teachers, the salary equity plan found in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-3-366, violated equal protection. The Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) dismissed the case. The teachers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The teachers claimed that the State failed to comply with the Supreme Court of Tennessee's directive in Small Schools II to equalize teachers' salaries according to the basic education plan (BEP) formula for funding public education. After careful consideration of the record and applicable authorities, the court found that the salary equity plan embodied in &sect; 49-3-366 did not equalize teachers' salaries according to the BEP formula and contained no mechanism for cost determination or annual cost review of teachers' salaries, unlike the BEP conditionally approved in Small Schools II. The court found that no rational basis existed for structuring a basic education program consisting entirely of cost-driven components while omitting the cost of hiring teachers, the most important component of any education plan. The lack of teacher salary equalization in accordance with the BEP formula continued to be a significant constitutional defect in the funding scheme. The salary equity plan failed to comply with the State's constitutional obligation to formulate and maintain a system of public education that afforded a substantially equal educational opportunity to all students.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the trial court's sentencing of defendant to death, following his conviction for premeditated murder. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued the trial court committed reversible error in excluding certain mitigating evidence and in admitting victim impact evidence; he argued that the death sentence was disproportionate. The appellate court found that hearsay was admissible in a capital sentencing hearing. Because the essence of the report was admitted through testimony, the error in excluding the report was harmless. A limitation on a witness's deposition that defendant did not murder the victim did not affect the jury's decision to defendant's prejudice. The victim impact evidence was not cumulative or unduly prejudicial, and its probative value was not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact. The prosecutor's comment that the jury was required to consider the impact of the crime did not improperly characterize the victim impact evidence as an aggravating circumstance. The death sentence was not imposed in an arbitrary fashion. Because neither codefendant was subjected to capital proceedings, their cases were not similar cases for purposes of proportionality review. Defendant's case was proportionate when compared to other murders for hire in which the death penalty was imposed.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals, Middle Section Chancery Court, Davidson County (Tennessee), reversed, and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A few months after the non-profit public benefit corporation was created, it contracted with the State, providing services related to childcare. All its operating revenue came from government sources. When the State Comptroller notified it that the State intended to conduct an audit of its records, it denied the auditors access. After additional demands for the records were refused, suit was filed, seeking a mandatory injunction requiring it to submit to the audit. The trial court found the corporation's contracts with the State provided a summary remedy, and ordered it to submit to an audit. A private citizen sought access to the same records, asserting they were public records. The trial court found the corporation was an independent contractor but its records were State property. The corporation appealed, and the Court of Appeals consolidated the cases. It agreed that the corporation was an independent contractor, not a governmental agency, but held the trial court's grant of access to all records overbroad. The instant court held all the corporation's records were subject to access under the Tennessee Public Records Act.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court agreed. The jury deliberated for approximately six hours on the sentencing issue before reporting: &quot;We are at a deadlock, 11 for death, and 1 for life imprisonment. What do we do at this point? The one for life imprisonment has stated that he will not change his mind.&quot; Over defense objections, the trial court returned the jury to open court and gave the instruction, the trial court did not ask the jurors whether further instructions and deliberations might assist them in returning a verdict. Instead, the trial court simply gave the instruction and ordered the jury to continue deliberation. Just one hour later, the jury returned with a unanimous verdict of death. While no inquiry was made, the note informed the trial court of the jury's division on the sentence of death, and the dissenting juror, who presumably held out for six hours, likely concluded that the trial court was instructing &quot;him,&quot; one of only four men on the jury, to reconsider his position. Therefore, the trial court erred.</SPAN></P>

Later, he said that defendant had hired him to kill for $ 5,000.The State evidenced that defendant had been having marital problems, did not want to endure the financial hardship of another divorce, had tried to hire others for killings, and had hired the teenager. The trial court excluded the teenager's foster father's testimony of the teenager's prior bad acts, and did not allow a crime scene investigator, retired from the F.B.I., to testify, on defendant's behalf, to the behavior and motive of the direct killer based on his analysis of crime scene physical evidence. The supreme court found that the behavioral analysis portion of that expert's testimony did not bear sufficient indicia of reliability to substantially assist the trier of fact. Such nonscientific testimony still had to meet the fundamental requirements of relevance and reliability. Although Tenn. R. Evid. 404(b) did not exclude testimony of the teenager's prior wrongs, given the overwhelming evidence against defendant, the exclusion was harmless error. Defendant showed little remorse.</SPAN></P>

Defendants bailed the neighbor out of jail. The next morning, the neighbor's sister went looking for him and joined up with defendants who apparently did not tell her that at one point that night they had been with him. A defendant threatened a bartender, who told the sister that the three had not returned to the bar and who refused to join with them in their search, that she might go missing. The neighbor was found shot to death. His sister's burned body was found. Bullet shells found at the scenes matched guns later found at one defendant's home. The trial judge refused to answer the jury's question whether if it gave defendants life sentences, they would be consecutive or concurrent with the life sentences for the sister's murder. The supreme court found that the search warrant affidavit and execution were proper. As no admitted evidence was improper as to one of the defendants, denial of severance was not error. Mitigation instruction that defendants were both human was unnecessary. As the jury made the aggravator findings, Apprendi did not apply. The refusal to answer was acceptable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The case was automatically docketed in the supreme court after the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the judgment of a jury of the Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee), convicting defendant of premeditated first degree murder and attempted second degree murder, and imposing a death sentence for the first degree murder and a 12 year sentence for the attempted second degree murder, to run consecutively to the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant shot the victim, a club security guard, outside the club after an earlier altercation. During the sentencing phase, the State relied upon the aggravating circumstance in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(2) (1991), that defendant had a prior conviction for a felony where the statutory elements involved the use of violence to a person. On automatic appeal, the supreme court held that: (1) denial of defendant's motion to admit expert testimony on eyewitness identification was not error; (2) the jury's verdict was sufficiently clear to demonstrate it found the aggravating circumstance relied on by the prosecution; (3) the evidence was sufficient to sustain the prior violent felony aggravating circumstance; (4) the refusal to allow defense counsel to refer to evidence from the guilt phase of trial in his closing argument in the sentencing phase of trial did not prejudice defendant and was harmless error; (5) it was not error to admit victim impact evidence during the sentencing phase; (6) the sentence of death was neither arbitrary nor disproportionate; and (7) the aggravating circumstance had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and outweighed mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A jury convicted defendant of driving under the influence (DUI), second offense, and driving on a revoked license (DRL), second offense, and imposed fines of &sect; 3,500 and $ 27,500 respectively. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals held that former Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-50-504(a)(2) violated Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 and U.S. Const. amend. VIII, because it did not specify the maximum fine for a DRL conviction. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Former Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-50- 504(a)(2) provided a minimum fine for second offense driving on a revoked license but failed to provide a maximum fine. The supreme court noted that when considering the constitutionality of a statute, courts had a duty to adopt a construction which would sustain the statute and avoid constitutional conflict if at all possible, and this duty required courts to indulge every presumption and resolve every doubt in favor of the statute's constitutionality. The supreme court concluded that the statute was not facially unconstitutional under either the state or the federal constitution for the mere failure to fix a maximum fine. However, fines imposed in specific cases under such statutes were subject to being challenged as excessive. When such a challenge was made, however, courts were required to first apply the principles of the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-101 et seq., to determine whether the fine was excessive before analyzing the constitutional validity of the fine. The supreme court held the $ 27,500 fine imposed by the jury was excessive under the principles of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court held the court of criminal appeals erred in holding the subject statute unconstitutional and modified defendant's fine for driving on a revoked license, second offense, to the statutory minimum of $ 3,000. Costs of the appeal were taxed equally between the State and defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Court of Criminal Appeals, Tennessee, affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of felony escape from a penal institution and theft of property over $ 1,000. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient because the legislature did not intend for a police patrol car to be considered a penal institution for the offense of escape under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-605. The language of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-601(4) (1997) did not specifically include or exclude in its definition of a &quot;penal institution&quot; the rear compartment of a police patrol car. There was no indication that the legislature used the word &quot;facility&quot; in any broader context than described in the statute and simply no evidence that it intended the word to include police patrol cars. The apparent similarities in the offenses of resisting arrest, evading arrest, and escape, underscored the importance of ascertaining the legislative intent and purpose in interpreting and applying each offense. Including a patrol car in the definition of &quot;penal institution&quot; unnecessarily expanded the offense of escape to circumstances that the legislature intended to address under other statutory offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of three counts of felony murder and sentenced to death on one count. Defendant's postconviction relief petition was dismissed. Dismissal was affirmed. He moved to reopen his petition under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-217(a)(2) (1997), which the trial court denied. The Court of Criminal Appeals denied him permission to appeal. The Tennessee Supreme Court granted his application for permission to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">While this case was pending on direct appeal, the Tennessee General Assembly enacted Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-203 (1991), which, adopting the national standard of mental retardation, provided that no defendant with mental retardation at the time of committing first degree murder should be sentenced to death. Both before and after defendant's postconviction hearing intelligence tests were administered to him and the testing doctor concluded he was mentally retarded. The supreme court, out of fundamental fairness, treated his motion to reopen as one, more appropriately, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-217(a)(1), on retrospective application of a new constitutional right. Whether execution of the mentally retarded was cruel and unusual punishment was an issue of first impression for that court, which held that it was cruel and unusual. The federal government and 18 states had legislation that prohibited their execution, and 12 states did not provide for capital punishment at all, showing that such executions were against contemporary standards of decency. Also under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 analysis, execution of the mentally retarded was disproportional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgments of the trial court and the court of criminal appeals were reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on the question of whether defendant was mentally retarded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of aggravated child abuse and first degree murder by aggravated child abuse, and was sentenced to death. The Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee) vacated the abuse conviction, and found the death sentence disproportionate and modified it to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. On further appeal, defendant argued against his conviction and the State argued against the sentence modification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant lived with his girlfriend and her children, the youngest seven months old, and often babysat them. One night she left them alone with him for a few minutes. A few hours later defendant discovered the baby not breathing and tried to resuscitate him. The baby, with no external bleeding or large bruising, but with skull fractures, soon died. After initial denials and differing accounts, defendant admitted to having become angry and physically abusing the baby. The supreme court held that electronic recording of interrogations was not required. Both the statutory elements and the case's facts established reckless indifference. As aggravated child abuse was a felony capable of supporting a first degree felony murder conviction, the merger doctrine was not to be applied to preclude that conviction even though the abuse resulted in the victim's death. This abuse was not a lesser included offense; the dual convictions were permissible. The Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(1) aggravator sufficiently narrowed the class of death-eligible defendants. Unlike compared cases, defendant may not have immediately realized the extent of the injuries. He appeared amenable to rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The vacation of the aggravated child abuse conviction was reversed and that part of the trial court judgment was reinstated. The sentence modification was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Slot machines were confiscated from defendant. The machines recorded games or credits won by a player. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-501's predecessor, Tenn.

The Sentencing Commission Comments to &sect; 39-17-501 provided the statute's definitions were intentionally broader than those found in the prior law. Since the earlier definition did not encompass defendant's devices, the current statute also applied to them, and defendant was on notice they were prohibited. Speculative danger of arbitrary enforcement of &sect; 39-17-501 did not render it void for vagueness. Since possession of a gambling device was not constitutionally protected conduct, &sect; 39-17-501, outlawing their possession, did not reach a substantial amount of such conduct and was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The inmate, along with other co-defendants, was charged with committing drug-related offenses in a multi-count indictment in federal district court. He hired the lawyers to represent him. He later alleged the lawyers asked him to persuade his co-defendants to hire them as well, telling him that none of the co-defendants could plead out and testify against him if they were under the lawyers' representation. Seven co-defendants hired the lawyers. The inmate alleged this joint representation created a conflict of interest. He also alleged the lawyers pressured him to plead guilty. After the inmate was sentenced to 20 years in prison, he filed a civil legal malpractice claim in state court. At the same time, his &quot;post-conviction&quot; motion to have his plea vacated on the ground of involuntariness was denied. The malpractice action was later dismissed. The appeals court concluded that because the federal courts had already determined the inmate's plea was voluntary, this finding necessarily encompassed the rejection of his malpractice allegations. If the evidence showed he pled guilty not because he was guilty but because of threats, the federal courts would have granted him relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A city police officer stopped defendant at a roadblock purportedly established to check drivers' licenses, and, marijuana was discovered in his vehicle. The statutory authority of highway patrol officers present to stop a vehicle to check operators' licenses was impermissibly delegated to other officers. The State presented no evidence of a required compelling state interest in maintaining the roadblock, and none was presumed, nor was there evidence it advanced such an interest. There was no evidence of any genuine limitations on the discretion of the officers in the field, and the roadblock was operated with little regard for the safety of approaching motorists. There was no advance publicity of the roadblock, nor was there any showing it was established with prior administrative authority. It did not comply with existing administrative guidelines from the department of safety. The presence of a drug-sniffing dog, and other evidence, indicated the roadblock was actually a subterfuge for other objectives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In two separate cases involving municipal codes, the Court of Appeals (Tennessee) ruled that a $ 300 sanction imposed by appellee city for reckless driving did not violate Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14, but affirmed reduction of the fine and found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-54-306, 55-10-307 were constitutional; and ruled that an assessment's label was immaterial to whether it fell within &sect; 14. Appellants, citizens, received consolidated review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">No other provision like &sect; 14, prohibiting any fine greater than $ 50 unless assessed by jury, was either in the federal or any other modern state constitution. The city court assessed a citizen for reckless driving under the authority of Chattanooga, Tenn., City Code &sect;&sect; 24-13(a), 1-8(a). The county court, under the authority of Nashville and Davidson County, Tenn., Metropolitan Code of Laws &sect; 16.04.172(A), assessed a citizen $ 500 for failures to secure a building permit and abide by a stop-work order. The Tennessee Supreme Court held that &sect; 14 applied to proceedings involving municipal ordinance violations when either the intended or actual purpose or effect of the monetary assessment was to serve as punishment. Because &sect; 14 looked to the substance of a pecuniary sanction rather than its technical form, technical distinctions as to the nature of the proceeding wherein the sanction was imposed and the sanction's label would not be made.  O'Dell v. City of Knoxville, 388 S.W.2d 150 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964), was overruled to the extent it held otherwise. The assessments were punitive. The citizens lacked standing to challenge city usurpation of district attorney discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In one case, the affirmation of a $ 50 rather than $ 300 fine was effectively upheld, as modified, by the holding that the $ 300 city court fine had been unconstitutionally imposed. In the other case, the judgment was reversed and the citizen's five fines were reduced to $ 50 for each warrant.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court concluded that there was no basis or rationale for applying the corroboration requirement to the sentencing phase of a capital trial. Additionally, the supreme court found that under statutory law at the time of defendant's offense, the trial court was not required to instruct the jury on non-statutory mitigating factors. Also, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that defendant's mental and psychological records were cumulative to the witness's testimony and thus inadmissible. Furthermore, although the trial court erred by refusing to allow defendant's expert witness to remain in the courtroom, its refusal did not affect the outcome to the prejudice of defendant. Finally, the supreme court found that the evidence supported the jury's finding of the statutory aggravating circumstances; that the evidence supported the jury's finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances; and that the sentence was not arbitrary, excessive, or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and arson and sentenced to death, then granted a new sentencing hearing. The trial court found the Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i)(5) and (6) (1982) aggravators of &quot;heinous, atrocious, and cruel&quot; and &quot;avoiding arrest,&quot; and resentenced defendant to death. The Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee) affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant, pastor, took church funds starting in 1984. Defendant got depressed in March 1987 when his superior, whose position he coveted, opted not to retire. Defendant stole more money, procured false identification papers, befriended a man who was his height, and hired him as church handyman, all as part of a plan to disappear and assume a new identity. In June, defendant shot the man to death; cut off his head and arm; left defendant's wallet in, and car with his own blood near, the victim's boarding room; and burned the church building containing the victim's body. After two days, defendant, very different in appearance, was caught. Defendant was convicted and sentenced. The Supreme Court held that the State's closing argument about &quot;unique circumstances&quot; was not an improper presentation of non-statutory aggravators in that the State first identified the two aggravators then offered factors to establish them. Defendant's extensive plan singling out the victim, and the dismemberment, supported the &quot;heinous&quot; aggravator. The jury could have found that defendant murdered, in part, to avoid arrest for his separate theft crime. Despite no prior record, sentence was proportional.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court's review of the record showed that the trial court never affirmatively decided the issue of constitutionality, either orally from the bench or in its written order, and certainly never provided citation to any authority for that supposed ruling. Defendant failed to timely raise a challenge to the constitutionality of the two statutes. His challenge was, therefore, waived except to the extent that the statutes were clearly or blatantly unconstitutional. The statutes at issue in the case were not clearly or blatantly unconstitutional. Moreover, failure to timely raise the issue at trial was compounded by the fact that the Tennessee Attorney General was not properly informed of the constitutional challenge as required by statute and rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant, sentenced to death, petitioned for writ of error coram nobis alleging new evidence. The petition was filed after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-26-105. The trial court dismissed the petition as untimely. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">While the statute of limitations in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-26-105, regarding filing of a petition for post-conviction relief, was not unconstitutional on its face, it could be unconstitutional as applied if it denied a defendant due process. A potential litigant had to be provided an opportunity to present a claim at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner before terminating his claim for failure to comply with a statute of limitations. This applied with even greater force when applied in a capital case to bar a claim newly discovered evidence might prove a defendant was innocent. Consideration of both the governmental interests involved and the private interests affected by the official action was required in determining what process was due. The governmental interest was the prevention of stale and groundless claims. The private interest was the opportunity to have a hearing on the grounds of newly discovered evidence which might have resulted in a different verdict if heard by the jury at trial. Application of the procedural time bar would result in defendant being put to death without an opportunity to have the merits of his claim evaluated by a court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgments of the court of criminal appeals and the trial court were reversed as defendant's interest in presenting his claim outweighed the government's interest. Defendant had to have an opportunity to show new evidence might have resulted in a different trial judgment. If he also showed no fault in failing to present the new evidence at the proper time, he would be entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff corporation owned numerous optical superstores throughout the country.

Plaintiff brought a cause of action against defendant governor challenging the constitutionality of Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 63-8-113(c)(6) (1997). The trial court certified the following question for the court: Whether an entity engaged primarily in the business of selling and dispensing ophthalmic lenses and frames is a retail store or other commercial establishment within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 63-8-113(c)(6)? The court answered in the affirmative. Businesses which sell ophthalmic lenses and frames are retail establishments. The purpose of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 63-8-1139(c)(6) was to prevent the compromising of the optometrists' professional autonomy by forbidding optometrists from forming business association with non-health care provider commercial entities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-206(a), pro se defendant and represented co-defendant appealed from an order of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, which affirmed their Shelby County Criminal Court convictions of first degree murder and their death sentences, raising numerous procedural, statutory, and constitutional errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Pro se defendant and represented co-defendant were each convicted of three counts of first degree murder, three counts of especially aggravated kidnapping and one count of especially aggravated robbery. Based on extensive evidence, the jury found numerous aggravating circumstances under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(2), (5), (7), and (12) (Supp. 1994) and imposed death. On direct appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed both defendant's and co-defendant's convictions and sentences. Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-206(a), the Supreme Court of Tennessee reviewed the record and affirmed the judgment against defendant, holding, inter alia, that defendant, by his extreme and egregious misconduct, implicitly waived and forfeited his right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The appellate court further held, under its proportionality review of capital cases, that the sentences of death upon pro se defendant were not excessive or imposed in an arbitrary manner. However, the appellate court reversed co-defendant's convictions and remanded for a new trial, holding that the trial court's failure to grant a severance resulted in prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Pro se defendant's convictions for first degree murder and sentences of death were affirmed; the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendant, through his conduct, waived his right to counsel. Co-defendant's convictions and sentences were reversed and the case remanded for a new trial because co-defendant's right to a fair trial was prejudiced when he was denied severance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant employee appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Warren County (Tennessee) which found that he had failed to meet the statute of limitations on his workers' compensation claim, and that his hearing loss was not work-related.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant employee had a hearing problem since he was a child. His hearing loss became more serious when he started working for appellee company as a bulldozer operator and then as foreman on construction sites where he was exposed to loud noise from machinery and explosives. After he stopped working for appellee, his attorney counseled him to file suit on the theory that his hearing loss might be work-related. The trial court ruled that appellant's suit was barred by the statute of limitations, and that appellant's injury was not work-related. The appellate court affirmed, but modified the judgment. Appellant had no actual knowledge that his condition was work-related until after he filed his complaint, which satisfied the statute of limitations. However, the court found the presence of a long-standing diagnosis of one condition and a recent diagnosis of a different condition puzzling. Under the circumstances, it could not say that the evidence preponderated against the trial court's findings that the injury was not work-related. Additionally, an improper procedure for referring the workers' compensation case to the clerk and master was used, but was not reversible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was affirmed as modified. As appellant learned that his injury was work-related the day before trial, the statute of limitations had not expired. However, the court could not say that the evidence preponderated against the findings of the trial court regarding causation of the injury. Although the proper procedure was not followed when the clerk and master was appointed, it was not reversible error.</SPAN></P>

He was treated for his injury and reached maximum medical improvement after he turned 60.

Plaintiff was to receive benefits for almost 2 years after his 65th birthday. Defendant employer alleged that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-6-207(4)(A)(i) applied and limited the number of weeks for payment from the date of maximum medical improvement to plaintiff's 65th birthday. The court found that because plaintiff was not over the age of 60 on the date of injury but was within 400 weeks of his 65th birthday when benefits for permanent partial disability became payable, the trial court applied the correct statute in awarding benefits and the benefits were payable beyond plaintiff's 65th birthday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A private attorney was approached by the executive director of an organization who asked him to meet with two assistant district attorneys, regarding the prosecution of obscenity cases. After the attorney spent a significant amount of time investigating and was compensated for his time, charges were brought against the defendants. The court agreed that the private attorney had an actual conflict of interest. He was privately compensated by a special interest group and thus owed a duty of loyalty to that group, at the same time, he was serving in the role of public prosecutor and owed the duty of loyalty attendant to that office. The defendants' liberty interests in the case were obviously significant, as they had been charged with multiple felony offenses. The private attorney's conflict of interest tainted the entire prosecution of the case well before the charges were presented to the grand jury. Dismissal of the indictments was the appropriate remedy to redress the constitutional error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An order from the Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee), affirming appellant's sentence of death after he pleaded guilty to first degree murder in perpetration of the rape of an eight-year-old girl, was automatically appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A jury sentenced appellant to death for the murder of a child. On automatic appeal from the appeals court, the sentence was affirmed. The evidence amply supported the two aggravating circumstances found by the jury, and any mitigating circumstances were outweighed beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant was not entitled to an instruction on the life imprisonment without possibility of parole because his offense was committed before the effective date of the act amending the capital sentencing statutes to provide for that sentence, and there was no constitutional impediment to the legislature's discretion. Although the court found technical error in the jury instruction regarding the weighing of circumstantial evidence, the error did not affirmatively affect the outcome of the hearing given that the jury could not have arrived at a contrary conclusion using the appellant's proposed instruction. Finally, the court compared the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the appellant with other cases in which the death penalty was imposed and affirmed, and concluded the sentence of death was neither arbitrarily nor disproportionately applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Judgment affirmed. Crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel under torture or serious physical abuse prongs and both aggravating circumstances were present and outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Appellant was not deprived of unanimous jury verdict. The constitution did not require an instruction on life without parole. Death sentence was neither disproportionate nor arbitrarily applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After striking certain parts of abortion statutes for unconstitutionally imposing an undue burden on a woman's right to choose abortion, the Tennessee Court of Appeals upheld the following provisions: the waiting period requirement, certain informed consent provisions, and the second trimester hospitalization requirement.  Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-15-202(d)(1), (b)(1)-(3), (b)(5)-(c), and -201(c)(2). Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, plaintiffs filed suit alleging, inter alia, that certain provisions of Tennessee's criminal abortion statutes violated a woman's right to privacy under both the state and federal constitutions. Applying the undue burden standard, the lower court struck certain provisions (e.g., that the attending physician inform the woman that &quot;abortion in a considerable number of cases constitutes a major surgical procedure&quot;), but upheld the waiting period requirement, the second trimester hospitalization requirement, and the remaining informed consent provisions. Finding that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy was a fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution, the court applied strict scrutiny to hold that the second trimester hospitalization requirement, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-15-201(c)(2), the informed consent and physician-only counseling requirements, &sect; 39-15-202(b)-(c), the mandatory waiting period requirement, &sect; 39-15-202(d)(1), and the medical emergency exceptions, &sect; 39-15-202(d)(3), -202(g), were unconstitutional because the statutes were not narrowly tailored to further compelling state interests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Applying strict scrutiny rather than the less exacting undue burden standard, the court partially affirmed and reversed the lower court's decision by holding that challenged provisions of Tennessee's criminal abortion statutes violated a woman's fundamental right to privacy under the Tennessee Constitution because the state failed to prove that the statutes were narrowly tailored to further compelling state interests. Remanded to trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee), which affirmed the trial court judgment overruling defendant's motion for a new trial on guilt or innocence before resentencing defendant to life imprisonment for first degree premeditated murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was re-indicted and tried for premeditated murder. The jury, pursuant to instruction, returned a guilty verdict and sentenced defendant to 40 years' imprisonment. Because the sentencing statute had been declared unconstitutional, the only legal sentence on a conviction for first degree murder was life imprisonment. The State moved to correct judgment; the trial court granted the motion and modified the sentence to life imprisonment. The court found the trial court lacked authority to change the jury's verdict, and ordered a new trial on punishment alone; that jury imposed life imprisonment. The court affirmed, finding that, while the appellate court should have remanded the case for a new trial, the decision was not manifestly unjust. The jury had the opportunity to convict defendant of second degree murder, and evidence overwhelmingly support the first degree conviction. The case, therefore, did not fall under the second exception to the law of the case doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Judgment affirmed. The appellate court properly affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a new trial. The case did not fall under the second exception to the law of the case doctrine. While the appellate court erred in remanding for a new trial on punishment alone, the error was not manifestly unjust.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals, Western Section (Tennessee), which affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendants, in a suit to determine whether the Tennessee Products Liability Act's 10-year statute of repose, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-28-103(a) (1980 &amp; Supp. 1999), was tolled when the plaintiff suffered temporary mental incompetency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendants, and it held that the Tennessee Products Liability Act's 10-year statute of repose, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-28-103(a) (1980 &amp; Supp. 1999), was not tolled by a plaintiff's physical or mental incompetence. The appellate court also held that the absence of a tolling provision for persons of unsound mind did not render &sect; 29-28-103(a)&nbsp;unconstitutional under the Tennessee Constitution. Plaintiff appealed. First, the court concluded that the failure of the legislature to expressly include any provision exempting persons of unsound mind from &sect; 29-28-103(a) strongly indicated its desire not to have such an exemption. Second, the language of the legal disability statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 28-1-106 (1980 &amp; Supp. 1999), strongly suggested that it only applied to toll statutes of limitations. Third, a policy that allowed a plaintiff's mental incompetency to toll a statute of repose would have severely damaged the purposes underlying statutes of repose generally because it envisioned no practical end to a defendant's liability. Consequently, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The jury found evidence of two aggravating circumstances; that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel and it was committed in the course of any first degree murder, rape, burglary or kidnapping; which outweighed evidence of mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt. The appeals court affirmed. Upon automatic review, the Tennessee Supreme Court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the murder verdicts and that the defendant was not entitled to relief on the issue of whether electrocution was cruel and unusual punishment. The court further concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the two aggravating circumstances for one murder count, as well as the jury's finding that the evidence outweighed any mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also held that the death sentence was not arbitrary, excessive or disproportionate to sentences imposed in cases involving similar crimes and defendants, and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The evidence supported the jury's findings as to aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the sentence of death was not imposed in any arbitrary fashion. The sentence of death was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the nature of the crime and the defendant. As to whether death by lethal injection was cruel and unusual, in light of the fact that lethal injection became a method of execution in Tennessee after defendant was tried and sentenced, the court concluded that a determination of the constitutionality of lethal injection would deprive the defendant of an opportunity to fully litigate the issue. The issue could be raised and determined in a petition for post conviction relief. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 47-18-102(b) protected business and consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting the conduct of any trade or commerce. Prior to the amendment of the Act, corporations were disallowed from pursuing treble damages. The Act, as amended in 1989, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-18-109(a) defined a person to include a corporation. The language of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 47-10-109(a) and 47-18-103(7) was clear and unambiguous. The two statutes indicated that corporations had standing to bring a private cause of action for treble damages under the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Tennessee Consumer Protection Act clearly contemplated that corporations injured by a violation of the statute should be granted standing; corporations had standing to bring a private cause of action for treble damages under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Tennessee Supreme Court granted review to address whether omission of a culpable mental state in an indictment for felony murder rendered the indictment insufficient to support a conviction for first degree felony murder.

The indictment provided ample information to protect the defendant from reprosecution for the same offense. The court concluded that recklessness, knowledge, or intent could be inferred from the conduct alleged in the indictment--that the defendant unlawfully killed the victim during the perpetration of the aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>

The officer searched defendant and found marijuana and a substance containing cocaine. The officer testified that he would have given defendant a citation and released him but defendant did not have his driver's license or other identification with him. The State presented no evidence of an objective reason to doubt the reliability of the information given by defendant. This court found that under Tenn.

It held that defendant was properly transferred under &sect; 37-1-134 because the trial court had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant committed the crimes with which he was charged. Additionally, the trial court had jurisdiction over felony murder because premeditated murder was addressed in the transfer order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The cause came to be heard upon the motion of the State requesting an execution date be set. Respondent filed a response to motion to set execution date and motion for certificate of commutation, alleging he was convicted upon perjured testimony and was not guilty of capital murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State argued respondent was not entitled to further delay in the imposition of his sentence of death and his case was not an appropriate one for the court to consider issuance of a certificate of commutation. All members of the court agreed that there is no legal basis why an execution date should not be set. The respondent had unsuccessfully challenged his conviction and sentence through direct appeal to the court and had unsuccessfully pursued state post-conviction and federal habeas corpus remedies. He had exhausted the standard three-tier appeals process. There existed no procedure, no method, and no means by which the conviction or the sentence could be further tested or scrutinized under the procedural guidelines within which the court functioned. His case was therefore ripe for the setting of an execution date. Accordingly, the State's motion to set an execution date was granted and the execution date set.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The motion for certificate of commutation was denied; the State's motion to set an execution date was granted. The record supported both the conviction and sentence. The respondent presented no extenuating circumstances that warranted issuance of a certificate of commutation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ISSUE: Whether defendant was entitled to postconviction relief. HOLDINGS: [1]-Although defendant contended that his postconviction claims were not time-barred, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(b)(1), because they were brought within one year of a federal opinion, which he contended established a new constitutional right requiring retroactive application, regardless of whether the opinion established a constitutional right not recognized at the time of defendant's criminal proceeding or whether retrospective application was required, defendant's arguments did not present a colorable claim for postconviction relief, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-30-103 and 40-30-106(f), because the Tennessee statute at issue, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-603(b)(3), was not void for vagueness, as it clearly required gauging the riskiness of conduct in which a defendant engaged on a particular occasion.</SPAN></P>
