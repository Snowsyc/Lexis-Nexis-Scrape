<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Preemption by State -- Field Preemption -- Public Lewdness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 10-165, which prohibits serial acts of public lewdness, is not preempted by Penal Law &sect;&sect; 245.00 (public lewdness) and 245.03 (public lewdness in first degree) under the doctrine of field preemption. The state legislature's enactment of Penal Law &sect;&sect; 245.00 and 245.03 does not show its intent to occupy the entire field of offenses involving public lewdness, as neither section conflicts with Administrative Code &sect; 10-165, and no section in Penal Law article 245 offers any policy declaration indicating the state legislature's intent to preempt municipal regulation. Moreover, the state legislature's silence on preemption at the time it enacted Penal Law &sect; 245.03, over six years after the New York City Council enacted Administrative Code &sect; 10-165, permits a reasonable inference that the state legislature had no intent to preempt home rule in the field of offenses involving public lewdness. Furthermore, no comprehensive state scheme covering public lewdness was identified to warrant a finding of implied field preemption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Possession of Weapon -- Self-Defense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information charging defendant with criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree based upon allegations that he possessed a box cutter in his right front pants pocket and that when asked about the box cutter, the defendant told a police officer that he possessed the box cutter &quot;to protect myself,&quot; was facially insufficient. By sufficiently pleading possession of a dangerous knife under Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (2), the People invoked the statutory presumption under Penal Law &sect; 265.15 (4) that defendant intended to use the box cutter unlawfully against another. While the statutory presumption alone was sufficient to establish reasonable cause, a competing interest could be drawn from defendant's statement that he possessed the box cutter for the lawful purpose of self-protection. Both inferences were drawn from the same allegation, affirmatively pleaded by the prosecution and, as there was no way to distinguish the relative strength of the inferences, they were of equal and opposite strength. As the information included no allegations to tip the balance one way or the other, the reasonable cause standard was not met.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Preemption by State -- Field Preemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 19-190, which requires a motorist to yield to a pedestrian or cyclist with the right-of-way, is not preempted by the Vehicle and Traffic Law under the doctrine of field preemption. Field preemption occurs when the state legislature has explicitly or implicitly stated its intention to be the sole arbiter in a certain area of law. While the Vehicle and Traffic Law imposes consistent rules and regulations on drivers and pedestrians throughout the state and restricts and invalidates enactment or enforcement of inconsistent laws, it was not intended to be the sole governing body in the area. The New York State Constitution's home rule provision confers broad power upon local government relating to the welfare of its citizens. Cities having a population in excess of one million, like New York City, are authorized, under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1642, to restrict and regulate traffic and pedestrian use of any highway by local law, ordinance, order, rule, regulation or health code provision. Moreover, Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1642 expressly allows local rules to supersede the state law (Vehicle and Traffic Law), if in conflict. That deference to local authorities explicitly shows that the state legislature did not intend the Vehicle and Traffic Law to preempt the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Preemption by State -- Conflict Preemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 19-190, which requires a motorist to yield to a pedestrian or cyclist with the right-of-way, is not preempted by Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1146 under the doctrine of conflict preemption. Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 and Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1146 both punish motorists who fail to exercise due care and fail to yield the right-of-way. Under Administrative Code &sect; 19-190, a motorist who fails to yield without causing injury can be charged with a traffic infraction. If the motorist injures a pedestrian or bicyclist while failing to yield, the motorist is charged with a misdemeanor. Under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1146, a motorist is not charged unless a pedestrian, bicyclist or animal is injured. If there is an injury, the motorist is charged with a traffic infraction. Repeat offenders, within the preceding five years, would be charged with a misdemeanor. While it is clear that the difference in penalty could result in inconsistencies in whether a motorist is charged, what the motorist is charged with and the potential penalty a motorist faces, preemption is only required if Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 conflicts with conduct prohibited by the state, prohibits conduct specifically permitted by the state, or imposes restrictions on rights granted by the state. Moreover, even if a conflict existed or a due process violation was found, Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 would supercede Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1146 as Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1642 (a) (10) expressly permits local law to supercede state law in the area of pedestrian and vehicle right-of-way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Violation of Municipal Code -- Failure to Yield Right-of-Way -- Constitutionality of Code Provision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 19-190, which requires a motorist to yield to a pedestrian or cyclist with the right-of-way using the &quot;due care&quot; standard, does not unjustifiably restrict defendant's state constitutional rights by not requiring a more stringent standard of care and/or mens rea of defendant's wrongdoing. The statute allows for an affirmative defense that the motorist exercised due care. In the context of Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 (and related Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1146), due care has been defined as the care of a reasonably prudent and competent driver to avoid colliding with pedestrians and cyclists. Given that a due care-reasonably prudent standard is recognized in several New York criminal statutes and has been upheld by the Court of Appeals, it is clear that the standard is accepted, and therefore does not unjustifiably restrict defendant's state constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law--Right to Bear Arms--Validity of Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1), Possession of Gravity Knife</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1), to the extent it criminalizes possession of gravity knives, does not violate the Second Amendment because, narrowly tailored as such, it was designed as a valid and constitutionally permissible exercise of the state's police power. The statute, like all legislative enactments, is supported by a presumption of validity demanding a demonstration of invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt and will be struck down only as a last un-avoidable result. Particular enactments that are fundamentally intended to protect public safety, in the form of a specific weapon prohibition, are subject to yet another factor weighing against a declaration of constitutional invalidity--the Second Amendment right to bear arms is subject to reasonable regulation pursuant to a state's police power. New York's prohibition against gravity knives appears to have been intended as such an exercise of reasonable regulation. When it was enacted in 1958, the legislature narrowly defined gravity knife to refer to a particular type of bladed instrument that was found to be nearly exclusively used as a weapon of choice of criminals, a practical replacement for the previously outlawed switchblade knife. Given that legislative intent, as applied to the cultural circumstances prevalent at the time of the law's enactment, the current version of Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1) prohibiting possession of gravity knives is not violative of the Second Amendment and defendant did not overcome the statute's strong presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 19-190 (b), which provides that a driver of a motor vehicle that makes contact with a pedestrian or bicyclist who has the right-of-way and thereby causes physical injury to that person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, if the driver failed to use due care (Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 [c]), is impermissibly vague and, therefore, facially unconstitutional. The statute turns on a purported culpable mental state of due care. However, except for specifically identified strict liability crimes, intentionality in some form such as purposely, knowingly, or recklessly, is required for criminality. Moreover, proof of criminal conduct must be beyond a reasonable doubt, as opposed to the civil preponderance of the evidence standard. Due care, which has been defined as that care which is exercised by a reasonably prudent driver, i.e., the absence of negligence, does not encompass any currently recognizable or general form of mens rea. The familiar civil liability feature of the due care standard of a reasonable person is inconsistent with the conventional requirement of criminal wrongdoing--awareness of some wrongdoing. Thus, Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 (b)'s use of a civil tort liability standard of negligence instead of the higher criminal standard of mens rea violates the defendant's rights and protections under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the New York State Constitution. The introduction of criminal guideline elements into civil negligence liability standards and the resulting vagueness--which offers no guidance to the judiciary, the People, or law enforcement, and can lead to arbitrary application of the law--violate the defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution based on evidence obtained after a police officer, in response to an animal control complaint about distressed dogs, observed marihuana plants and growing equipment in defendant's backyard, the officer's warrantless entry into the backyard was authorized under the emergency doctrine to determine whether immediate action was necessary to alleviate needless suffering or avoid irremediable harm to the dogs. Under the emergency doctrine, police may execute a warrantless search in limited circumstances presenting an immediate danger to life or property as opposed to seeking a criminal suspect or preserving evidence of a crime. Police are not required to obtain a search warrant provided that they have reasonable grounds to believe that there is an emergency at hand and an immediate need for their assistance for the protection of life or property. Here, the 911 caller stated that she witnessed mistreated dogs, and mentioned that one or more of those dogs were in the backyard. The officer, from a lawful vantage point, saw six dogs in a pen adjacent to the driveway without food, water, or shelter, and a large amount of feces on a warm day, and heard dogs barking from the backyard. Based on those facts, the officer could have reasonably inferred from the barking coming from the backyard that those dogs were in a similar, or potentially more serious, condition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Upon an application by petitioner Public Advocate for the City of New York seeking a summary judicial inquiry under New York City Charter &sect; 1109 premised upon allegations that respondent City Department of Education (DOE) and its Chancellor neglected and/or violated their duty to provide legally-mandated services to children with disabilities and to protect the City from wasteful contracts, DOE was not shielded from the proposed inquiry by the State Constitution's Home Rule provision (art IX, &sect; 2 [b] [2]). Though the Home Rule provision grants the City constitutional protection against intrusion by the state legislature concerning city property, affairs or government, section 1109 is part of the City's Charter and thus provides a tool to those city officials enumerated in the statute to seek information about city affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools--Education of Children with Disabilities--Summary Judicial Inquiry into Violation or Neglect of Duty by City Department of Education and Chancellor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner Public Advocate for the City of New York established that a summary judicial inquiry under New York City Charter &sect; 1109 was warranted based on allegations that, as a result of technical inadequacies in the Special Education Student Information System developed to provide citywide data regarding the provision of services to children with disabilities, respondent City Department of Education and its Chancellor neglected and/or violated their duty under federal law to provide individualized education program-mandated services to such children and failed to recoup related Medicaid reimbursements on behalf of the City. Summary inquiry into those issues was warranted because they were not presently being investigated by any other agency or department and the underlying facts had not yet been fully disclosed to the public and/or were wholly undeveloped on the record and otherwise not undisputed. Additionally, the absence of any allegations of corruption was not a bar to the inquiry as the plain language of section 1109 does not limit its applicability to cases involving corruption, and an examination of the statute's legislative history suggested that section 1109 was intended to be broader than its predecessor statute with regard to the category of acts into which a summary inquiry thereunder could be made.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent's diagnosis of other specified paraphilic disorder hebephilia, generally defined as a sexual interest in pubescent children, could not provide the basis for finding that respondent required sex offender civil management pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law article 10, as hebephilia is not generally accepted as a mental disorder within the psychiatric community under the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Frye</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> standard. A newly named diagnosis of &quot;pedohebephilia&quot; was proposed for inclusion in the DSM-5 but was ultimately rejected, presumably because it was opposed by most of the psychiatrists and psychologists who worked in the sex offender psychiatric community. The evidence presented showed that research supporting inclusion of the new diagnosis was sparse, and some experts believed the existing research to be irrevelant because having sexual urges involving pubescent youngsters is insufficient for a diagnosis of a mental disorder. Moreover, using age as a proxy for a hebephilic sexual preference is problematic because pubertal onset is highly variable, and therefore a hebephilia could not be diagnosed without an examination of a victim by a trained clinician at the time of an offense. Scholarly articles strongly support the view that hebephilia is not a generally accepted diagnosis, and is relevant outside the research context only in sexually violent predator (SVP) proceedings as a tool to commit or supervise sex offenders under SVP programs.</SPAN></P>

Under Public Officers Law &sect; 89 (3) (a), &quot;[a]n agency shall not deny a request on the basis that [it] is voluminous or . . . burdensome,&quot; and where the agency &quot;has the ability to retrieve or extract a record or data maintained in a computer storage system with reasonable effort, it shall be required to do so.&quot; Thus, an agency relying on the volume of a request must establish that the request is unduly burdensome and that an outside service cannot be utilized to comply with the request. Respondent conceded that it had neglected to update its technology, and any true examination of the burden of petitioner's request had to account for the costs associated with updating software in order to make the redactions. Moreover, an agency is not permitted to charge for time spent reviewing records to determine which portions, if any, may be withheld. Therefore, respondent could not pass the costs associated with reviewing or redacting the requested footage onto petitioner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An accusatory instrument charging defendant with an unclassified misdemeanor for violating the Right-of-Way Law (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 19-190) by striking and causing physical injuries to a pedestrian in a crosswalk with a motor vehicle was dismissed because the law is facially unconstitutional under both the State and Federal Constitutions. Under the Right-of-Way Law, &quot;any driver of a motor vehicle who fails to yield to a pedestrian . . . when such pedestrian . . . has the right of way . . . and whose motor vehicle causes contact with a pedestrian . . . and thereby causes physical injury&quot; is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine and imprisonment for not more than 30 days, unless &quot;the failure to yield and/or physical injury was not caused by the driver's failure to exercise due care&quot; (Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 [a]-[c]). Legislative enactments carry a strong presumption of constitutionality and a party seeking to find a statute unconstitutional bears a heavy burden of demonstrating, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statute suffers from wholesale constitutional impairment. All parties agreed that the statute was intended to apply a civil tort negligence standard in lieu of a culpable mens rea normally required in criminal cases. The Right-of-Way Law therefore was unconstitutional on its face because such use of a civil tort liability standard of negligence in a criminal case violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution and State constitutional protections, specifically a defendant's rights to due process, to be presumed innocent and against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Bids and Bidders -- Bidding for Lease of Property -- Independent Appraisal Required</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a proceeding seeking to nullify the bidding process employed by respondent public transportation authorities to lease a bar located within a railroad terminal which had been operated by petitioner for more than 17 years, respondents were preliminarily enjoined from leasing the bar to any other bidder until an appraisal &quot;made by an independent appraiser and included in the record of the transaction&quot; as required by Public Authorities Law &sect; 2897 (3) was conducted. The appraisal conducted was done by a real estate salesperson associated with respondents' leasing agent who became inextricably intertwined in the process by providing the appraisal to all bidders. By engaging in the process, he undermined the intent of the Public Authorities Law to promote greater efficiency, openness and accountability on the part of public authorities. Accordingly, petitioner established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claim, and that it could sustain harm to its reputation if the property were awarded to another bidder. The balance of the equities also weighed in petitioner's favor, since it had operated the property for 17 years and, through its investment of time and labor, had built a world famous reputation. However, petitioner failed to establish its entitlement to a preliminary injunction maintaining its tenancy in the property, since respondents were entitled to remove petitioner upon 30 days' written notice pursuant to the lease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Unlicensed General Vending -- Sale of Russian Nesting Dolls Not Entitled to First Amendment Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In defendant's prosecution for allegedly &quot;display[ing] and offer[ing] for sale&quot; Russian nesting dolls without &quot;displaying a license&quot; and &quot;not produc[ing] one when asked,&quot; Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 20-453, under which it is unlawful &quot;to act as a general vendor without having first obtained a license,&quot; was constitutional as applied to defendant. In New York City, people selling paintings, photography, prints or sculptures are exempt from the license requirement of Administrative Code &sect; 20-453, while all other &quot;potentially expressive&quot; objects may constitutionally be made subject to licensure as a reasonable time, place or manner restriction. In determining whether an item constitutes visual expression protected by the First Amendment, the court must decide whether the item could be objectively understood to have any expressive or communicative elements, and whether it also has a common non-expressive purpose of utility. Given defendant's description of the items as &quot;dolls,&quot; they were not included in the four specific categories of visual expression. However, given that the dolls were described as &quot;hand-painted with traditionally thematic folk art&quot; bearing the signature of the artist, the historical meaning of the pieces as Russian folk art and their predominant purpose of visual expression and aesthetics, the dolls were expressive. Nonetheless, the law was narrowly tailored to serve the primary purpose of reducing urban congestion on streets and sidewalks, yet allowed for multiple alternative venues for communication. Thus, even though the dolls were &quot;predominately expressive,&quot; the licensing ordinance was a constitutionally appropriate content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction on the sale of those dolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Unlicensed General Vending -- Facial Sufficiency of Information</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The information charging defendant with unlicensed general vending based on allegations that he &quot;displayed and offered for sale&quot; Russian nesting dolls without &quot;displaying a license&quot; and &quot;did not produce one when asked&quot; in violation of Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 20-453 was facially sufficient. The accusatory instrument was not required to allege that the offense was public in nature. The complaint charged defendant with selling goods without a license across from a particular street address which was a large open pedestrian area leading to a public park. Thus, one could reasonably infer that the incident occurred in a &quot;public space&quot; within the meaning of Administrative Code &sect; 20-452 (d). Further, the accusatory instrument alleged that the officer observed defendant standing, for approximately two minutes, next to a table upon which the dolls were offered &quot;for sale,&quot; that the officer saw four people approach defendant, examine the merchandise and engage in conversation with defendant and that when the officer approached defendant and asked the price of the merchandise, defendant said $40.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a nonpayment summary proceeding, petitioner landlord's application for a default money judgment against respondent tenant was denied where respondent was served by conspicuous substitute service, rather than by personal delivery.

The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McDonald</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Court's rule was based on a reasonable and valid interpretation of the legislative intent of the statutory provision that governed the service requirements for petitions against tenants in summary proceedings at the time, coupled with a judicial concern that allowing a money judgment to be obtained on substituted service would break down a long-established uniformity.

IV protection for subscriber communications seized from an ISP, and suppression was not available for a violation of the Stored Communications Act, defendant was not entitled to suppression; [4]-The People were required to return and expunge communications they did not identify as responsive to the warrants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the prosecution of defendant for his alleged involvement in a fraudulent &quot;pump and dump&quot; penny stock promotion scheme, the People were not required to obtain eavesdropping warrants pursuant to CPL 700.05 in order to seize defendant's emails. New York's eavesdropping statute is designed to cover communications in transit rather than stored emails. Therefore, the procedure followed by the People--obtaining a search warrant directed to an Internet service provider to obtain customer communications--was the proper vehicle for obtaining defendant's emails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Search Warrant -- Overbroad Language</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the prosecution of defendant for his alleged involvement in a fraudulent &quot;pump and dump&quot; penny stock promotion scheme, the warrants permitting seizure from defendant's email accounts of evidence regarding &quot;involvement in a scheme to defraud and related crimes&quot; were overbroad and therefore unlawful. Under the Fourth Amendment, a warrant will not issue unless supported by an oath &quot;particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized,&quot; meaning that the warrant must be specific enough to leave no discretion to the executing officer. Here, the warrants could only be read as providing that &quot;related crimes&quot; would extend beyond a &quot;scheme to defraud&quot; since the warrants twice noted that such related crimes included but were &quot;not limited to&quot; involvement in a scheme to defraud. The affidavits asserted that a search of defendant's emails was expected to uncover evidence of one pump and dump scheme, but the language of the warrants would have supported an argument that evidence of additional crimes would have been validly seized no matter what was found. As the third-party doctrine does not apply to email content held by an Internet service provider, suppression was not an available remedy. Moreover, &quot;blanket suppression&quot; of the emails was not appropriate, since there was no flagrant disregard of the warrants' terms and the People did not act in bad faith. Accordingly, the People were required to return and expunge any material seized from defendant's email accounts which they did not identify as responsive to the warrants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Accusatory Instrument -- Trespass Notice Converted Misdemeanor Complaints into Informations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution for trespass, a trespass notice issued by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) qualified as a business record exception to the hearsay rule and sufficed to convert the misdemeanor complaints into informations. A NYCHA trespass notice bans from public housing any person who is arrested for a felony drug crime on or near NYCHA property, mandating that if an excluded arrestee is present on NYCHA property following an arrest, he or she will be automatically arrested again for criminal trespass regardless of the reason for the visit. CPLR 4518 provides that a record of an event is admissible in evidence in proof of that event if it was made in the ordinary course of business when it is the ordinary course of the recorder to make such records. Here, the complaints alleged that a trespass notice was served on defendant and that defendant was in violation of that notice. NYCHA's trespass notice policy established that trespass notices are records made pursuant to established procedures for the routine, habitual, and systematic making of such records. While the notice was served on defendant by a police officer whose signature was &quot;on file,&quot; CPLR 4518 specifically allows electronic records into evidence if they otherwise qualify as a business record. Further, the New York Police Department and its officers are custodians of NYCHA trespass notices. As the notice was admissible as a business record, no further allegations were required for pleading purposes to establish defendant's knowledge that he was not welcome in the premises, and the complaints, read in conjunction with the notice, established a prima facie case of trespass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-- Accusatory Instrument -- Sufficiency of Factual Allegations -- Trespass</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution for trespass, a complaint that alleged that defendant was inside the lobby of a New York City Housing Authority building in violation of the posted rules and regulations, was not a resident of the premises, was unable to provide a legitimate reason for his presence and lacked permission or authority to be there was not legally sufficient to establish that defendant was knowingly unwelcome in the premises. For criminal trespass, it must be established that a person knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a premises when he is not licensed to do so. Where premises are open to the public, a person has license to enter unless he defies a lawful order not to enter or remain, personally communicated to him by the owner of such premises or other authorized person. However, it is not the case that all property owned by the government is open to the public, and it is possible for a person to enter or remain in a publicly-owned dwelling without license or privilege to do so. Here, the allegations failed to establish that the area was not open to the public--such as that defendant had gone through a locked door or beyond a no trespassing sign--and failed to establish that defendant had any actual knowledge that his presence was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Information -- Facial Sufficiency -- Smoking Electronic Vapor Cigarette on Subway Platform</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The information charging defendant with violating smoking restrictions contained in the Public Health Law based on allegations that he &quot;smok[ed] an electronic vapor cigarette on [a] subway platform, which is not a designated smoking area,&quot; was facially insufficient. Public Health Law &sect; 1399-o (1) (e) provides that &quot;[s]moking shall not be permitted&quot; in &quot;underground subway stations.&quot; The term &quot;smoking&quot; is defined as &quot;the burning of a lighted cigar, cigarette, pipe or any other matter or substance which contains tobacco&quot; (Public Health Law &sect; 1399-n [8]). An electronic cigarette neither burns nor contains tobacco. Instead, the use of such device involves the inhalation of vapourized e-cigarette liquid consisting of water, nicotine, a base of propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin and occasionally flavouring, which does not fit within the definition of &quot;smoking&quot; under Public Health Law &sect; 1399-o.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Disorderly Conduct -- Violation of New York City Transit Authority Rules -- Smoking Electronic Vapor Cigarette on Subway Platform</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The information charging defendant with disorderly conduct in violation of 21 NYCRR 1050.7 (b), which provides that no person in a New York City Transit Authority facility shall &quot;smoke or carry an open flame or lighted match, cigar, cigarette, pipe or torch,&quot; based on allegations that he was &quot;smoking an electronic vapor cigarette on [a] subway platform, which is not a designated smoking area,&quot; was facially insufficient. The term &quot;facility&quot; includes the subway platform where defendant was observed (21 NYCRR 1050.2 [b]). Although the Transit Authority rules do not separately define the term &quot;smoke,&quot; the references in 21 NYCRR 1050.7 (b) to &quot;open flame or lighted match . . . or torch&quot; suggest that the concern addressed by the provision is the risk of fire. The words &quot;electronic vapor&quot; sufficiently described the device and made it clear that it is not an item that is lit by a flame or that actually burns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Obstructing Governmental Administration -- Cursing at Police and Refusing to Produce Identification</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The information charging defendant with obstructing governmental administration based on allegations that he refused requests by police to produce identification so they could issue him a criminal summons and that he &quot;told&quot; police officers &quot; 'fuck you' three times in a loud voice and . . . stated loudly, 'get the fuck away from me' &quot; was facially insufficient. The issuance of a summons is an &quot;official function&quot; with which a defendant may not lawfully interfere. If the obstruction is accomplished by interference, the interference must be, in part at least, physical in nature. Defendant's refusal to provide identification did not physically interfere with the officer's ability to write defendant a summons. Furthermore, ignoring a police officer's request for identification is not a crime, and therefore does not amount to an &quot;independently unlawful act&quot; under Penal Law &sect; 195.05. There was no subjective allegation that the officer was intimidated by defendant's conduct, and defendant's utterance of an obscenity, absent any physical act or other words to create a credible threat, was not objectively intimidating so as to interfere with the administration of the governmental function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Disorderly Conduct -- Cursing at Police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The information charging defendant with disorderly conduct based on allegations that he &quot;told&quot; police officers &quot; 'fuck you' three times in a loud voice and . . . stated loudly, 'get the fuck away from me' &quot; was facially insufficient. &quot;A person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof: . . . In a public place, he [or she] uses abusive or obscene language, or makes an obscene gesture&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 240.20 [3]). It is not illegal to yell or curse at a police officer. Such argumentative words constitute disorderly conduct under the Penal Law only when the situation extends beyond the exchange between the individual disputants to a point where it becomes a potential or immediate public problem. There was no allegation from which the court could infer that defendant attracted any public attention, or that he even inadvertently created public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm or risked doing so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent's denial of petitioner's industrial and commercial real property tax abatement application was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion where respondent determined that petitioner violated Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 11-270 (e) (1) (b) by filing its final abatement application more than one year after the issuance of its initial building permit. Administrative Code &sect; 11-270 (e) (1) (b) provides that an applicant shall file its final application for abatement benefits no later than one year from the date of issuance of the &quot;first building permit for construction work.&quot; Tax benefits and exemptions, such as an abatement, are narrowly construed in favor of the taxing authority. In order to prevail over strict construction in favor of the taxing authority, the petitioner must show that its interpretation of the statute is the only reasonable construction. Here, petitioner's assertion that the statute's use of the word &quot;first&quot; instead of &quot;initial&quot; gave rise to ambiguity was without merit as, although petitioner received several building permits, there was no conceivable way to construe petitioner's subsequent building permits as the &quot;initial&quot; or &quot;first&quot; permit authorizing construction on the subject plot of land.</SPAN></P>

Neither the registration fee nor the decal fee are apportioned based upon a carrier's actual use of New York highways, and evidence established that the cost per mile for the registration and decal fees was greater for non-New York based businesses than it was for New York based businesses. In particular, plaintiffs' expert surmised that taxpayers with an out-of-state address drive, on average, far less on New York roads than taxpayers with a New York address. Moreover, the statutes' validity under the Commerce Clause did not turn on the amount of the flat fees charged, and defendants presented insufficient evidence to establish that apportionment of the registration and decal fees based on miles traveled would be impractical and pose genuine administrative burdens.</SPAN></P>

The constitutionality of the local law was challenged as it applied to plaintiff.

Determining the reasonableness of an amortization period is an inherently factual inquiry with a balance to be struck between an individual's interest in maintaining the present use of his or her property and the general welfare of the community sought to be advanced by the zoning ordinance. If the owner can show that the loss suffered as a result of the removal of a nonconforming use at the expiration of the amortization period is so substantial that it outweighs the public benefit gained by the legislation, then the amortization period must be held unreasonable. Thus, the question was whether, considering the amounts invested in the plant, the value of the buildings and equipment, and the ability and cost to relocate the plant, the appropriate balance had been struck and plaintiff had been given an opportunity to recoup its investment and avoid substantial financial loss. Moreover, evidence of any other reasonable costs which bear upon the kind and amount of damages that the plaintiff might sustain can be used to ascertain whether the injury is so substantial that the ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff. Therefore, plaintiff was permitted to proffer evidence of its reasonable litigation expenses in order to ascertain its investment in the plant and to determine whether or not it had suffered a substantial financial loss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Defendants, a city, police department, and officer, were not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's false arrest and false imprisonment claims; although the officer had probable cause to arrest plaintiff once he admitted money found on his person was counterfeit, his testimony, if credited, negated probable cause to initially stop him, which was fatal to defendants' claim of qualified immunity for his subsequent arrest; [2]-As there was a fact issue as to whether the officer had probable cause for his initial stop of plaintiff's vehicle, defendants were not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim; [3]-Plaintiff's negligent hiring, retention, and supervision claims had to be dismissed because defendants admitted that at all relevant times, the officer had acted with the scope of his employment with the city and department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motion was granted in part and denied in part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Torts -- False Imprisonment -- False Arrest -- Probable Cause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a civil action arising out of plaintiff's arrest for criminally possessing a forged instrument, defendants were not entitled to summary judgment dismissing the claims for false arrest and false imprisonment because they failed to establish, beyond a factual dispute, that plaintiff's arrest was based on probable cause. When confronted with proof of false arrest and/or imprisonment, a defendant can nevertheless prevail if he or she proves legal justification for the arrest and imprisonment, which may be established by showing that the arrest was based on probable cause. According to plaintiff, defendant police officer stopped plaintiff's vehicle after plaintiff made a legal turn, ordered plaintiff to exit the vehicle, handcuffed him and proceeded to search the vehicle, during which the officer found money he alleged to be counterfeit. The officer, however, testified that he stopped plaintiff's vehicle after he saw plaintiff make an illegal U-turn and noticed a $100 bill with smeared ink on the center console, and that plaintiff admitted the bill was fake and that he had more fake money in his glove compartment. The evidence thus raised an issue of fact as to whether the stop of plaintiff's vehicle was lawful, and as such whether the arrest thereafter was lawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Torts -- Malicious Prosecution -- Probable Cause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendants were not entitled to summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim arising out of his arrest for criminally possessing a forged instrument following a police stop of his vehicle, where issues of fact existed regarding whether the police had probable cause to stop plaintiff's vehicle. The elements of the cause of action for malicious prosecution stemming from a prior criminal proceeding are the commencement or continuation of a prior criminal proceeding by the defendant, the termination of the prior proceeding in favor of the plaintiff, the absence of probable cause for the initiation of the prior criminal proceeding, and actual malice. Whether there is probable cause to initiate a prosecution hinges on whether the defendant's conduct at the time he or she commenced the prior proceeding would have led a reasonably prudent person to initiate the proceeding. Plaintiff testified that his vehicle was stopped after he made a legal turn at a traffic light, while defendant police officer testified that he stopped plaintiff's vehicle after he saw plaintiff make an illegal U-turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Employment Relationships </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-- Respondent Superior -- Police Officer Acting within Scope of Employment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff's cause of action alleging negligent hiring, retention and training of defendant police officer who stopped his vehicle and subsequently arrested him for criminally possessing a forged instrument was dismissed, where defendant municipality and its police department conceded that the officer's actions were within the scope of his employment. Generally, where an employee is acting within the scope of his or her employment, thereby rendering the employer liable for any damages caused by the employee's negligence under a theory of respondeat superior, no claim may proceed against the employer for negligent hiring or retention. Within their amended answer, defendants answered for the police officer, thereby admitting that at all relevant times he was acting within the scope of his employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Rights</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Federal Civil Rights Claim -- Failure to Allege Municipal Policy or Custom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a civil action arising out of plaintiff's arrest for criminally possessing a forged instrument following a police stop of his vehicle, plaintiff's cause of action pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1983 against defendant municipality and its police department was dismissed because plaintiff failed to plead the existence of an official policy or custom which deprived him of a constitutional right. A municipality bears liability under 42 USC &sect; 1983 only where the action by its agent alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body's officers. Accordingly, municipal liability only lies if the municipal policy or custom actually caused the constitutional tort and not merely because the municipality employs a tortfeasor who perpetrated a constitutional tort. Plaintiff failed to plead specific facts establishing that his arrest, assault, imprisonment and prosecution were the result of a municipal custom or practice, and failed to identify the municipal custom and practice which he alleged existed and which resulted in his arrest, imprisonment and prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The State was entitled to permanently enjoin the independent subscription agents from soliciting business in violation of General Business Law &sect; 335-a by sending magazine renewal subscriptions to New York subscribers without disclosing the month and year in which the subscription expired because jurisdiction was appropriate under CPLR 302(a) where a servicer and its owner reviewed and processed the solicitations, derived substantial revenue from interstate commerce, and should have anticipated that the solicitations would have consequences within New York, the fact that the regulation might preclude the agents from sending solicitations to New York did not render it unconstitutional, and the disclaimer on the back of the solicitations raised a question of fact as to whether the agents' solicitations amounted to deceptive acts under General Business Law &sect;&sect; 349 and 350.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts--Jurisdiction--Long-Arm Jurisdiction--Out-of-State Consulting Firm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a special proceeding commenced by petitioner Attorney General alleging that respondent independent subscription agents in the business of soliciting magazine subscriptions and renewals sent misleading solicitations to New York consumers in violation of the General Business Law, respondent out-of-state consulting firm--providing bookkeeping, data management, consumer mail processing and consumer refund processing support for the solicitation business--was subject to long-arm jurisdiction in New York. Though the firm was careful not to project itself into New York or to transact business there, it was subject to jurisdiction under CPLR 302 (a) (1) where it had, albeit indirectly, availed itself of the benefit of New York consumers and laws. The firm's reason for being was to support and facilitate the solicitations sent to New York consumers, it had a role in formulating the content thereof and its profits flowed therefrom. Moreover, the firm's clients--other respondents providing the firm's revenue--were owned by a New York limited liability company. The firm was also subject to jurisdiction under CPLR 302 (a) (3) as it allegedly committed the tortious act of reviewing and processing solicitations that violated New York law, and it clearly derived substantial revenue from interstate commerce and should have anticipated that the solicitations would have consequences in New York. Finally, the exercise of long-arm jurisdiction over the firm was appropriate under a due process analysis as its activities established minimum contacts with New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts--Jurisdiction--Long-Arm Jurisdiction--Owner of Out-of-State Consulting Firm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a special proceeding commenced by petitioner Attorney General alleging that respondent independent subscription agents in the business of soliciting magazine subscriptions and renewals sent misleading solicitations to New York consumers in violation of the General Business Law, respondent owner of an out-of-state consulting firm--providing bookkeeping, data management, consumer mail processing and consumer refund processing support for the solicitation business--was subject to long-arm jurisdiction in New York in her individual capacity for the same reasons the firm was subject to such jurisdiction. The owner herself conducted all of the activity ascribed to the firm in the petition, and any benefit that accrued to the firm also accrued to the owner. As New York has rejected the &quot;fiduciary shield doctrine,&quot; the owner could not avoid jurisdiction because she was working as an officer of the firm while accruing contacts with New York, especially because she enjoyed almost total control over the firm as its owner, president and principal laborer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes--</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute--</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">General Business Law &sect; 335-a Not Violative of Substantive Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. General Business Law &sect; 335-a--requiring any entity engaged in the business of soliciting magazine subscriptions for delivery in New York through the mail for profit to disclose, in any direct written communication inviting a magazine subscriber to renew a subscription, the month and year in which the subscriber's subscription expires (General Business Law &sect; 335-a [4])--does not violate substantive due process, notwithstanding its applicability to independent subscription agents. The legislature's legitimate purpose in passing the statute was consumer protection, and that interest was rationally related to the statutory obligation, which applies to for-profit entities engaged in soliciting magazine subscriptions. That the legislature chose to balance that interest with the interest of promoting nonprofit enterprises, by excluding them from the statutory obligation, did not provide an opportunity for the court to re-legislate the issue. Similarly, the statute was not rendered unconstitutional because independent subscription agents, which typically have no relationship to magazine publishers and thus no way of knowing whether subscriptions exist or when they expire, might be precluded from sending solicitations to New York. The legislature made an implicit judgment within its authority that, if a subscription agent does not know when a subscriber's current subscription ends, it cannot solicit that subscriber for a renewal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Consumer Protection--Deceptive Acts and Practices--Misleading Solicitation of Magazine Subscriptions and Renewals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a special proceeding commenced by petitioner Attorney General alleging that respondent independent subscription agents in the business of soliciting magazine subscriptions and renewals sent misleading solicitations to New York consumers, questions of fact existed to be determined at a hearing before a factfinder on the claims under General Business Law &sect; 349, prohibiting deceptive business practices, and its companion, General Business Law &sect; 350, prohibiting false advertising. Petitioner made a prima facie showing on those claims through submission of respondents' solicitations, which were clearly consumer directed and, at least, raised a question of fact as to whether reasonable consumers would be materially misled. The solicitations themselves seemed to create the impression that they were being sent directly from magazine publishers, rather than respondents, and the implication could cause consumers to believe that they were being offered the subscriptions at a standard price, rather than the significant premium offered by respondents. Factual issues existed, however, whether respondents' solicitations amounted to deceptive acts. The disclaimer on the back of the solicitations raised a question of fact whether a reasonable consumer would have taken the time to read it and learn that the solicitations were not being sent by publishers and that the cancellation policy might be more draconian than the ones offered by publishers.</SPAN></P>

Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 19-190 (b), which provides that &quot;any driver of a motor vehicle . . . which causes contact with a pedestrian . . . and causes physical injury, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,&quot; does not unconstitutionally impose criminal liability on motorists who cause physical injuries to pedestrians by accident or shift the burden of proof to the motorist to prove that he or she was not at fault. The statute fits the definition of a strict liability crime in Penal Law &sect; 15.10, and meets the &quot;minimal requirement&quot; for criminal liability by specifying voluntary acts which an actor is physically capable of performing. Moreover, the statute does not deem a motorist involved in an accident to be per se guilty of a criminal offense, and provides an affirmative defense to a motorist charged with the crime. There is no language or provision in the statute that places a burden on the accused to prove any of the elements of the alleged crime nor is there an express or implied presumption of liability or guilt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The information charging defendant with violating Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 19-190 (b) based on allegations that he caused the death of a pedestrian legally crossing the street by driving his taxi into an intersection and turning left without yielding to the pedestrian was facially sufficient. The facts alleged sufficiently established a violation of the statute and were detailed enough to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense. Furthermore, the information stated that the relevant facts were obtained through the officer's observations of video surveillance tapes, defendant's admissions and the decedent's certified death certificate, none of which constituted hearsay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Where the bus defendant was driving struck and killed a pedestrian who was allegedly in a crosswalk, the court granted defendant's motion to dismiss a charge of violating Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1142(b), vehicle entering stop or yield intersection; although a driver had to yield the right of way to pedestrians in crosswalks, crosswalks were not yield signs, and the information did not alleged that there was a yield sign at the intersection where the accident occurred; [2]-Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1146 was not unconstitutionally vague because it put drivers on notice that they had to exercise the care of a reasonably prudent and competent driver to avoid colliding with pedestrians, cyclists, or domestic animals while driving a vehicle on any roadway, and the term &quot;due care&quot; was not so vague that it would promote arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Traffic Infractions -- Vehicle Entering Stop or Yield Intersection -- Crosswalk Not Yield Sign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The information alleging that defendant bus driver violated Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1142 (b), which requires a driver &quot;approaching a yield sign&quot; to yield to pedestrians legally crossing the roadway, was facially insufficient, where the information was devoid of factual allegations that defendant approached a yield sign at the intersection where she struck a pedestrian in the crosswalk when the crosswalk light indicated that the pedestrian had the right-of-way. Based on the National Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices standards for yield signs and examples of conforming yield signs, a yield sign must be a street sign. Even if a driver must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians crossing in crosswalks, crosswalks cannot be yield signs for purposes of section 1142 (b). Defendant's statements established that she approached and proceeded through a light, a traffic control signal, and that the pedestrian was crossing a crosswalk with the crosswalk indicating that he had the right-of-way. The factual allegations therefore failed to establish reasonable cause that defendant committed the offense charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Preemption by State -- Rules of New York City Transit Authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 19-190, which provides that &quot;any driver of a motor vehicle who fails to yield to a pedestrian . . . when such pedestrian . . . has the right of way shall be guilty of a traffic infraction,&quot; is not preempted by Public Authorities Law title 9, which governs the operations of the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA). A plain reading of Public Authorities Law &sect; 1204 (5-a) reserves the NYCTA's expansive rulemaking for limited, specific purposes, the maintenance of facilities and the conduct and safety of the public who use the facilities. Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 does not attempt to regulate the use and operation of transit facilities, but instead controls the conduct of all drivers by imposing the use of due care while driving. Moreover, section 1266 (8) does not automatically invalidate any law that affects the operation and activities of the NYCTA, but only those that interfere with the accomplishment of its transportation purposes. Requiring an NYCTA bus operator to exercise due care to avoid hitting pedestrians, crossing the road with the right-of-way, does not conflict with the accomplishment of such purposes, and amplifies the NYCTA's goal of promoting the public's convenience and safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1146 (a), which requires that drivers &quot;exercise due care&quot; to avoid colliding with bicyclists, pedestrians and domestic animals when driving a vehicle on the roadway, is not unconstitutionally vague. The statute puts one on notice that he or she must exercise the care of a reasonably prudent and competent driver to avoid such collisions, and that any driver in violation of subdivision (a) who causes a &quot;physical injury&quot; or a &quot;serious physical injury,&quot; as defined in the Penal Law, faces a fine and/or other penalties. Due care is also not so vague that it would promote arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The court held that the local laws and regulations with respect to outdoor advertising on a railroad's property or rights of way were not preempted by the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 10101 et seq., therefore, the railroad's cross claim was dismissed; [2]-The court further held that railroad rights-of-way, railroad trestles and overpasses of a transportation authority upon which nine signs of outdoor sign companies were affixed or erected were not facilities devoted to purposes other than transportation or transit, that those facilities were not subject to the jurisdiction of the City of New York, New York, and were exempt from local laws, thus, the city could not enforce its zoning resolution with respect to the nine signs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- Local Laws Prohibiting Outdoor Advertising Signs on Railroad Property -- Exemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In hybrid CPLR article 78 and declaratory judgment actions by petitioner outdoor advertising companies challenging respondent City of New York's decision denying registration for advertising signs located on or affixed to railroad facilities owned by petitioner Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), such facilities were not devoted to purposes other than transportation or transit purposes and were therefore exempt from the City's local laws and regulations prohibiting placement of the signs on the properties. Public Authorities Law &sect; 1266 (8) expressly provides that local laws and rules that are &quot;in conflict&quot; with Public Authorities Law, article 5, title 11, or any rule or regulation of MTA or its subsidiaries are inapplicable to its facilities, except for &quot;facilities that are devoted to purposes other than transportation or transit purposes.&quot; Insofar as application of the local laws at issue would result in a loss of revenue to MTA from outdoor advertising, a conflict existed under section 1266 (8)--the loss of revenue from compliance with the local laws and regulations would interfere with the accomplishment of MTA's function and purpose of generating revenue to fund public regional transportation. Moreover, the outdoor signs did not render the railroad facilities unusable as railroad rights-of-way, trestles, and overpasses. Those facilities continued to function as part of a system for moving trains and transit equipment, and nothing in the record indicated that the signs affected that function in any way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Federal Preemption -- Federal Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 -- Laws Managing or Governing Rail Transportation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In hybrid CPLR article 78 and declaratory judgment actions by petitioner outdoor advertising companies challenging respondent City of New York's decision denying registration for advertising signs located on railroad rights-of-way owned by respondent transportation company, the City's local laws and regulations prohibiting placement of the signs on the properties were not preempted by the Federal Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA) (49 USC &sect; 10101 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">). The ICCTA preempts all state laws that may reasonably be said to have the effect of managing or governing rail transportation, while permitting the continued application of laws having a more remote or incidental effect on rail transportation. Zoning regulations barring advertising signs located on railroad rights-of-way or overpasses, which consequently limit the raising of advertising revenue for a commuter train system, do not have the effect of managing or governing rail transportation. Therefore, the regulations could not be said to have an effect, if any, on &quot;the movement of passengers or property, or both, by rail&quot; (49 USC &sect; 10102 [9] [A]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Taking of Property -- Ripeness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In hybrid CPLR article 78 and declaratory judgment actions by petitioner outdoor advertising and transportation companies challenging respondent City of New York's decision denying registration for advertising signs located on or affixed to railroad facilities owned by respondent transportation company, petitioners' claim that enforcement efforts pursuant to those decisions would constitute an unconstitutional regulatory taking of private property was not ripe for judicial review. As petitioners could potentially establish, on an individual basis, that some or all of the signs were entitled to the status of a legal nonconforming use, they may have been unable to show that the local laws and regulations prohibiting placement of the signs on the properties deprived petitioners of all economically beneficial use of the railroad rights-of-way, or that they resulted in economic impact that interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations. Moreover, dismissal of the transportation company's claim for common-law indemnification and contribution against the City was warranted. Because the regulatory takings claim was not ripe for adjudication, there were no damages for which the transportation company could be presently held either vicariously liable or jointly liable with the City.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Property owners who had filed a petition under General Municipal Law &sect; 703(1) to annex a portion of a town's territory to a village, and whose properties overlapped with territory sought to be annexed by respondent municipalities and individuals, were entitled to seek a writ of prohibition to restrain the municipalities from taking any action on those later petitions due to their alleged lack of jurisdiction, as the role of a municipal board in acting on such petitions was quasi-judicial in nature; [2]-Where different municipalities sought to annex the same territory, the common law prior jurisdiction rule applied and once the annexation process commenced, the affected municipalities had exclusive jurisdiction over any annexation of the territory at issue until the annexation process was finally concluded; therefore, the owners were entitled to the writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' first cause of action for a writ of prohibition was granted and their second cause of action was dismissed, as were respondents' cross-claims and counterclaims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-- Standing -- Writ of Prohibition -- Owners of Property within Proposed Annexation Area</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioners, owners of property within an area that was the subject of two annexation petitions filed by respondent individuals one year after petitioners had filed their own annexation petition, had standing to maintain a CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking a writ of prohibition restraining respondent municipalities from acting on the later-filed petitions. A person has standing to challenge governmental action by showing that he or she would suffer direct harm--injury that is in some way different from that of the public at large--and that the injury falls within the zone of interests, or concerns, sought to be promoted or protected by the statutory provision under which the governmental entity has acted. Petitioners, as owners of property within the area proposed to be annexed by respondents' petitions, had a direct interest in the administrative action being challenged, different in kind or degree from that of the public at large. Further, the interests of owners of taxable property within a proposed annexation area fall within the &quot;zone of interests&quot; of the Municipal Annexation Law (General Municipal Law art 17). Moreover, by virtue of their statutory right to receive formal notice of any joint public hearing on the petitions, petitioners were entitled to a presumption of standing to bring the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Prohibition -- Availability -- Jurisdictional Issue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to restrain respondent municipalities from acting on two petitions for the annexation of certain territory that were filed by respondent individuals one year after petitioners, owners of property located within that territory, had filed their own annexation petition, petitioners stated a cause of action for a writ of prohibition on the ground that respondent municipalities lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petitions. Prohibition does not lie against strictly administrative action, but only against judicial and quasi-judicial action. When brought against an administrative official, the latter must therefore be shown to be exceeding jurisdiction in some quasi-judicial capacity. Petitioners' allegation that the prior jurisdiction rule deprived respondents of taking action on the petitions related to a matter of jurisdiction. However, petitioners' contention that the petitions were commenced for an illegitimate purpose did not relate to a jurisdictional issue, and a writ of prohibition was not an appropriate remedy with respect to that cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Annexation of Territory -- Multiple Petitions for Overlapping Territory -- Prior Jurisdiction Rule</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to restrain respondent municipalities from acting on two petitions for the annexation of certain territory that were filed by respondent individuals one year after petitioners, owners of property located within that territory, had filed their own annexation petition, respondent municipalities were restrained by the common-law prior jurisdiction rule from acting on the later-filed petitions. Once the municipal annexation process has commenced by the filing of a petition for annexation, the affected municipalities shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any annexation of the territory until the annexation process is finally concluded. The policy behind the prior jurisdiction rule is to prevent inconsistent determinations, to promote judicial economy, and to provide for the orderly administration of justice. Permitting multiple annexation petitions for overlapping territory to simultaneously proceed to referenda could result in a multitude of overlapping special elections, which inherently poses a risk of incompatible election results.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The information was sufficient under CPL 100.15 and 100.40(1) to charge defendant with second-degree aggravated harassment under Penal Law &sect; 240.30(1)(b) because defendant caused a communication to be initiated by telephone that he knew or reasonably should have known would cause the complainant to reasonably fear for her physical safety where his statement, &quot;I'm going to beat the fuck out of you,&quot; possessed all the characteristics of a true threat and not just a crude outburst, tended naturally to evoke immediate violence, promised to cause severe physical harm, and was neither conditional nor unspecific.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Aggravated Harassment -- Sufficiency of Information -- Threat to Cause Physical Harm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An information charging defendant with aggravated harassment in the second degree based on the allegation that defendant called the complainant on the telephone and stated &quot;I am going to beat the fuck out of you&quot; sufficiently alleged a true threat to cause physical harm under Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1) (b). The elements of aggravated harassment in the second degree include, among other things, &quot;a threat to cause physical harm&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1] [b]). Since section 240.30 (1) (b) criminalizes certain types of speech alone, a defendant's communication may invoke free speech protection. Unless speech presents a clear and present danger of some serious substantive evil, it may neither be forbidden nor penalized. Only particular kinds of communication may be prohibited, such as fighting words, true threats, incitement, obscenity, child pornography, fraud, defamation or statements integral to criminal conduct. The statement possessed all the characteristics of a true threat in that it tended naturally to evoke immediate violence as a promise to cause severe physical harm. The context of the communication was unnecessary as the statement was clear on its face. The statement did not fail for lack of immediacy as true threats are not required to convey an exact time and place where the threatened harm is to be inflicted. Defendant's statement was neither conditional nor unspecific but was a promise of future action which was unambiguous. An ordinary and reasonable listener would interpret it as an impending assault, and not just a crude outburst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Aggravated Harassment -- Sufficiency of Information -- Intent to Harass</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An information charging defendant with aggravated harassment in the second degree based on the allegation that defendant called the complainant on the telephone and stated &quot;I see you are not wearing the black boots that you were wearing early this morning when you dropped off Jalissa. I am going to beat the fuck out of you&quot; sufficiently alleged an &quot;intent to harass&quot; under Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1). The elements of aggravated harassment in the second degree include, among other things, an &quot;intent to harass another person&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1] [b]). An intent to harass requires words, conduct, or action that forms a pattern or multiplicity of contact between the harasser and the harassed. A reasonable person may infer from the statement that defendant was present and actually observed complainant, or that he had means of obtaining information about complainant, or that he was stalking her. The threatening phone call acted as a second action directed at complainant. Further, there is a presumptive inference that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of his or her actions. The factual allegations created a reasonable inference that the defendant's purpose of calling was part of a conscious desire to alarm complainant persistently.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the unlawful use of secret scientific material prosecution of defendant computer programmer, who had uploaded computer source code from the high-frequency trading system of his former employer without permission after accepting a job with a new high-frequency trading firm, the trial evidence was legally insufficient to demonstrate that defendant made a &quot;tangible reproduction or representation&quot; of secret scientific material as required by Penal Law &sect; 165.07. Defendant uploaded the computer source code to a server in Germany and then downloaded it to his home computer. Although defendant duplicated and transferred the computer source code, his former employer continued to possess the code and never lost a single line of it. There was no evidence that defendant ever duplicated the source code he downloaded to a piece of paper, any medium where it could be touched or any medium outside a computer or thumb drive. Computer code does not become tangible merely because it is contained in a computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Use of Secret Scientific Material -- Intent to Appropriate Use of Secret Scientific Material</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the unlawful use of secret scientific material prosecution of defendant computer programmer, who had uploaded computer source code from the high-frequency trading system of his former employer without permission after accepting a job with a new high-frequency trading firm, the trial evidence was legally insufficient to demonstrate that defendant had the &quot;intent to appropriate&quot; to himself or his new employer the use of the computer source code as required by Penal Law &sect; 165.07. In order for a defendant to have the intent to &quot;appropriate&quot; the use of secret scientific material, he or she must have the intent to exercise control over it &quot;under such circumstances as to acquire the major portion of its economic value or benefit&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 155.00 [4] [a]). Although the evidence demonstrated that defendant wrongfully duplicated the computer source code and intended to derive a significant economic benefit from it, it did not prove he intended to appropriate all or a major portion of the code's economic value or benefit for himself or his new employer. There was no direct evidence that defendant's conscious objective was to acquire the major portion of the source code's economic value or benefit, and such intent could not be inferred by defendant's conduct and all of the surrounding circumstances. Defendant's former employer was not deprived of any of its high-frequency trading profits because of defendant's actions, defendant did not earn any money from his conduct, and defendant possessed the code for 33 days prior to his arrest. Moreover, there was no evidence from which the jury could conclude what the economic value of the source code was.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The court dismissed the objections raised by two insurance companies because whether the ex-wife was entitled to any of the proceeds of a $ 1,300,000 life insurance policy of the decedent under EPTL 5-1.4 required an evidentiary hearing as too many questions existed as to whether the insurance proceeds from other life insurance policies satisfied the decedent's obligation under the matrimonial separation and settlement agreement; [2]-The court clarified that it had jurisdiction over whether the estate or the ex-wife was entitled to life insurance proceeds from decedent's life insurance policy, which clearly affected the settlement of the affairs of the decedent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Surrogate's Court -- Jurisdiction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Surrogate's Court had jurisdiction to determine whether decedent's former spouse, who, prior to her divorce from decedent, had been named as the beneficiary of decedent's life insurance policy, or decedent's estate was entitled to the policy proceeds. Insofar as the issue was a matter which affected the settlement of the affairs of the decedent, the court had power to grant all relief necessary in the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A hearing was required to determine whether EPTL 5-1.4, which provides that, under certain circumstances, &quot;a divorce . . . revokes any revocable . . . disposition or appointment of property made by a divorced individual to, or for the benefit of, the former spouse&quot; (EPTL 5-1.4 [a]), was unconstitutional as applied to petitioner former spouse, who, prior to her divorce from decedent, had been named as the beneficiary of decedent's life insurance policy, based upon decedent's pre- and post-divorce actions allegedly establishing his intent that petitioner be the beneficiary of the policy. An &quot;as applied&quot; challenge to a statute involves a determination as to whether the statute can be constitutionally applied to the individual under the facts of the case. The factual context and the individual's circumstances are critical, and credibility of persons having exclusive knowledge of facts should not be determined by affidavits submitted on summary judgment motions, but rather at trial by the trier of facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-A parolee's motion to suppress physical evidence and statements was granted because the search of the parolee was at best arbitrary and unconstitutional pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 and CPL 140.10 where his parole officer failed to provide any justification whatsoever for walking up to him and placing him in handcuffs without first inquiring as to whether he was headed home to make his curfew or ask what he was doing in the area, the parolee was not alleged to have violated his parole in any manner, and there was no attenuation between the unreasonable seizure of the parolee and the discovery of drugs by the parole officers or statements made by the parolee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Suspicionless Search and Seizure of Parolee by Parole Officer -- Suppression of Evidence Required</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A parole officer's suspicionless search and seizure of defendant parolee violated the New York Constitution because the officer--who walked up to defendant as he stood across the street from the house of another parolee being visited by parole officers, immediately placed him in handcuffs, pat searched him and seized several packets of narcotics--acted without any justification rationally and substantially related to the performance of his duty. Although the United States Constitution Fourth Amendment does not prohibit a police officer from conducting a suspicionless search of a parolee, the New York Constitution grants parolees greater protection by requiring a parole officer to have an articulable and particularized concern substantially and rationally related to parole supervisory responsibilities before seizing or searching a parolee. The parole officers were not at the house being visited to check on defendant and there was no proof that he had any association with the house or the other parolee. Even if the parole officer was justified in approaching and handcuffing defendant due to unexpressed safety concerns stemming from a recent residential shooting and defendant's prior record, there was no justification related to parole supervision to search defendant without first inquiring about his presence in the area. The drugs recovered from defendant and the statements he made were suppressed because they were the immediate byproduct of, and not attenuated from, the constitutionally unreasonable seizure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner inmate, who had not been convicted of a sex offense, was not entitled to immediate release in a habeas corpus proceeding alleging that the determination to supervise him as a &quot;discretionary sex offender&quot; upon his release violated his due process rights, where the determination revoking petitioner's postrelease supervision was not based solely on a finding that he violated a release condition mandating his participation in sex offender therapy. Where an inmate who has not been convicted of a sex offense is nevertheless designated, in some form, as a sex offender and coerced to participate in intensive sex offender therapy, a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause of the US Constitution is triggered. However, even if the determination to supervise petitioner as a discretionary sex offender violated his constitutional due process rights, habeas corpus relief directing petitioner's immediate release from custody and restoration to parole supervision would only be appropriate if the revocation of parole was based solely on a finding that he violated the parole condition mandating his participation in sex offender therapy. The mere fact that petitioner may have been unlawfully designated a &quot;discretionary sex offender&quot; for parole supervision purposes did not mandate the judicial reversal of a subsequent final parole revocation determination in the absence of such allegations/findings.</SPAN></P>

Records of any Family Court proceeding, in general, are confidential and not open to indiscriminate public inspection. The plain language of Family Court Act &sect; 1038 (a) limits the use of discovery in an article 10 proceeding to that proceeding alone, consistent with the overriding concern that courts protect the welfare of children while guaranteeing due process to all parties in abuse and neglect proceedings. Criminal defense counsel was not representing or actively participating in the representation of defendant in the Family Court matter, and the fact that Family Court counsel and defense counsel were members of the same firm did not entitle them to share discovery documents. Moreover, defendant's right to the production of documents does not automatically supercede statutory privileges and privacy protections. Nonetheless, because the report and recordings of the interviews were admitted into evidence during the article 10 fact-finding hearing and had thus been made public, criminal defense counsel's application for a subpoena duces tecum for an in camera inspection of the report and recordings was granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. New York City's handgun licensing scheme is not unconstitutional under the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution and does not violate Civil Rights Law &sect; 4, the language of which is nearly identical to that of the Second Amendment. The right to keep and bear arms as a means of self-defense within the home conferred by the Second Amendment and, by extension, Civil Rights Law &sect; 4, is not absolute and may be limited by reasonable governmental restrictions. The licensing scheme satisfies the requisite constitutional standard, intermediate scrutiny, as it serves a governmental interest in maintaining public safety. Petitioner, whose application for a license to carry a concealed handgun for self-defense when conducting his business of selling and traveling with firearms and tactical equipment was denied by respondent, also failed to state a claim for violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment under the &quot;class of one&quot; theory. It was not enough for petitioner to allege that he was entitled to a business carry license because other federally licensed firearms dealers were issued licenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Firearms -- Proper Cause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent's determination denying petitioner's application for a license to carry a concealed handgun for self-defense when conducting his business of selling and traveling with firearms and tactical equipment was not arbitrary and capricious, where petitioner failed to demonstrate &quot;proper cause&quot; for carrying a concealed weapon as required under Penal Law &sect; 400.00 (2) (f). Although &quot;proper cause&quot; is not defined in Penal Law &sect; 400.00 (2) (f), it has been interpreted to mean a special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the general community or of persons engaged in the same profession. That definition is reflected in 38 RCNY 5-03, which petitioner failed to demonstrate was not properly promulgated. Respondent's disbelief that petitioner was exposed to extraordinary danger due to either employment or business necessity or to documented recurrent threats to life or safety was supported in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ISSUE: Whether to grant defendant's CPL 330.30(1) motion to set aside the jury's verdict convicting him of predatory sexual assault against a child (Penal Law &sect; 130.96). HOLDINGS: [1]-The evidence was legally sufficient to prove the sexual conduct at issue occurred after he turned 18, as he stated he had sexual contact with the victim on dates that were after his 18th birthday; [2]-The conviction was supported by sufficient evidence of &quot;egregious&quot; conduct to warrant conviction on the higher predatory sexual assault charge, as opposed to the lesser included count of criminal sexual act; [3]-As the evidence supported the prosecutor's discretionary decision that this was an exceptional case warranting prosecution for the lower degree crime, the trial court properly declined to dismiss the higher charge and properly submitted the lesser charge to the jury as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution arising out of sexual contact between defendant and a 12-year-old child, defendant's conviction for predatory sexual assault against a child was supported by legally sufficient evidence that the contact occurred after defendant turned 18. Defendant stated that he engaged in sexual contact with the victim in July and August, after his 18th birthday in June. While the victim testified that the contact occurred during the school year, without referencing specifically which school year, the reasonable inference from the context of her testimony was that she was referring to the following school year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes--Lesser Included Offense--</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Identical Elements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution arising out of sexual contact between defendant and a 12-year-old child, there was sufficient evidence of egregious conduct to warrant defendant's conviction for predatory sexual assault against a child, as opposed to the lesser inclusory charge of criminal sexual act in the first degree. The offenses on their face have identical elements; therefore, if the evidence was sufficient to support conviction of the lower offense, it was sufficient to support the conviction of the higher. Moreover, where, as here, the court concludes that, despite the prosecutor's initial charging decision, the evidence reasonably supports the conclusion that the case is &quot;exceptional&quot; and warrants prosecution for a lower charge, the remedy is not to dismiss the higher charge but, rather, as the court did here, submit the lesser charge as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ISSUE: Whether the trial court should reconsider its order granting defendant police officer a Huntley hearing to determine the admissibility, under CPL 60.45, of her statement to an assistant district attorney (ADA) recanting her allegation that she saw a man repeatedly hit a woman. HOLDINGS: [1]-As a reasonable person in defendant's position would not have believed she was in custody when she was directed to appear at the ADA's office in the furtherance of her duties as a police officer, and she was never told she would be dismissed if she refused to answer any questions, her Miranda rights were not violated; [2]-However, this did not obviate the need for a Huntley hearing because such a hearing was required whenever a defendant claimed her statements were involuntary, no matter what facts she put forth in support of that claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adhered to its prior order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Confession -- Noncustodial Statements -- Statement Made by Police Officer Relating to Official Duties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant police officer, whose statement that she observed an assault formed the basis of a complaint that she signed under penalty of perjury, but who later admitted in a statement to an assistant district attorney (ADA) that she arrived at the scene &quot;after the assault was over,&quot; was not in custody for purposes of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the time she made the statement in the ADA's office. A reasonable person in defendant's position, innocent of any wrongdoing, would not have believed he or she was in custody. Defendant, who was the arresting officer and a key witness in the assault case, was notified by the ADA to report to his office for the purpose of preparing the case for trial. She arrived at the District Attorney's office by her own transportation, her movements were not restricted and there was no discussion of her being detained for her conduct. It would be absurd to consider that a police officer is in custody for purposes of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> each time the officer is directed to appear at the District Attorney's office in furtherance of the officer's job duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Immunity from Prosecution -- Statement Made by Police Officer Relating to Official Duties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A statement made by defendant police officer to an assistant district attorney (ADA)--that, despite having previously stated that she observed an assault, she arrived at the scene &quot;after the assault was over&quot;--was not immunized from use in a criminal proceeding against defendant. While it was implicit for defendant as a police officer to cooperate with the ADA on a case in which she played a pivotal role, she was never faced with the choice between forfeiting her job and incriminating herself. It is unconstitutional to condition public employment upon a waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination, and a statement made by a public employee under threat of dismissal is thus immunized from use in a criminal proceeding against the employee. Here, defendant was not told that she would be dismissed if she refused to answer the ADA's questions; she was simply notified by the ADA to come to his office to further discuss the assault case in which she was the arresting officer and a key witness. Moreover, the District Attorney's office was not defendant's employer, and neither that office nor the ADA had the authority to terminate her employment. Finally, defendant's subjective fears as to what might have happened if she failed to appear at the District Attorney's office were insufficient to immunize her statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Confession -- Necessity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Huntley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant police officer, whose statement that she observed an assault formed the basis of a complaint that she signed under penalty of perjury, but who later admitted in a statement to an assistant district attorney that she arrived at the scene &quot;after the assault was over,&quot; was granted a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Huntley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing to determine the admissibility of her statement, notwithstanding that she was not in custody for purposes of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the time she gave the statement and that the statement was not immunized from use in a criminal proceeding against defendant. A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Huntley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing is required whenever a defendant claims that his or her statements were involuntary no matter what facts he or she puts forth in support of that claim. Here, in her original moving papers, defendant maintained that the statement was involuntarily made because she was compelled to make it under threat of job forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

In holding that the failure of a plea court to advise a defendant of the PRS component of a sentence violates due process by rendering the plea unknowing, unintelligent and involuntary, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> court relied on its own precedent, which had cited federal constitutional due process case law. Moreover, recent appellate decisions have implicitly acknowledged that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> error is a federal constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Sentence -- Second Violent Felony Offender -- Predicate Convictions Obtained in Violation of Federal Constitutional Rights --</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15"> Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Violation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Upon defendant's CPL 400.15 (7) (b) challenge to the use of certain prior convictions as predicate felony convictions for purposes of adjudicating him a second violent felony offender, the rule articulated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (4 NY3d 242, 825 NE2d 1081, 792 NYS2d 887 [2005])--that a plea court's failure to advise a defendant of the postrelease supervision (PRS) component of a sentence violates due process by rendering the plea unknowing, unintelligent and involuntary--applied to defendant's prior convictions as a rule of law existing at the time the convictions were obtained, notwithstanding that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was decided thereafter. At the time of defendant's pleas to the prior convictions, PRS was required to be imposed as a part of a determinate sentence, and a plea court was required to advise a defendant of the &quot;direct&quot; consequences of the plea to comport with federal due process principles. Thus, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not change the law inasmuch as, at the time of defendant's prior convictions, the plea court had to advise him of the PRS component of his sentence as a direct consequence of his pleas.</SPAN></P>

Upon defendant's CPL 400.15 (7) (b) challenge to the use of certain prior convictions as predicate felony convictions for purposes of adjudicating him a second violent felony offender, the rule articulated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (4 NY3d 242, 825 NE2d 1081, 792 NYS2d 887 [2005])--that a plea court's failure to advise a defendant of the postrelease supervision (PRS) component of a sentence violates due process by rendering the plea unknowing, unintelligent and involuntary--applied retroactively under each of the three potentially applicable retroactivity rubrics. First, recent appellate decisions demonstrated that, where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> challenges arise in the context of sentence enhancement proceedings, the law has engrafted an exception to the traditional rule to permit collateral attack on judgments of conviction after they have become final. Second, under the rubric for determining retroactive application of a federal rule of constitutional procedure, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> merely applied an existing rule--that due process requires a plea court to advise a defendant as to the &quot;direct&quot; consequences of his or her plea--in a new setting--PRS. Finally, under the state law rubric, the pertinent factors weighed in favor of retroactivity. A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> error impacts the determination of guilt or innocence inasmuch as the plea allocution process involves an admission of guilt; to the extent courts and prosecutors had relied on rules antedating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, those rules gave notice that a plea court was required to inform a defendant of the PRS component of his or her sentence as a &quot;direct&quot; consequence of the plea; and it is unlikely that retroactive application of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Catu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in sentence enhancement proceedings would have an undue detrimental effect on the administration of justice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an adoption proceeding initiated by the prospective adoptive parents after the birth mother sought to revoke her surrender of the child for adoption, the biological father--with whom the mother was not wed--was deemed a consent father under the unique facts and circumstances presented. The father was not aware of the mother's pregnancy, the child's birth or the adoption itself until so informed by the mother several weeks following the child's birth and the mother's surrender of the child for adoption, and there was no evidence that the father received notice of the adoption from the adoption agency. Though the mother and father lived in the same apartment in South Carolina during a portion of the mother's pregnancy, the mother was not aware that she was pregnant until she reached 35 weeks' gestation, by which time she had already moved from South Carolina to New York, and various witnesses testified credibly that she did not look pregnant while she was living in South Carolina. After the mother moved to New York, the father continued to reside in South Carolina and had no physical contact with her. Moreover, upon learning of the child's birth and adoption, the father promptly petitioned for an establishment of paternity, and his custody petition manifested a willingness to assume custody of the child. Finally, the father provided the majority of support to the mother during the months they lived together in South Carolina, and his failure to pay for pregnancy or delivery expenses was due to no fault of his own because he was unaware of the mother's pregnancy and the child's birth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Prohibition -- When Remedy Appropriate -- Proceeding to Revoke Liquor License</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Prohibition was not warranted where defendant/respondent New York State Liquor Authority initiated an administrative proceeding to revoke plaintiffs/petitioners' license to operate a liquor store for selling alcoholic beverages to out-of-state purchasers, allegedly in violation of the laws of the vendee's state, because defendant/respondent was supported by abundant statutory authority to commence and maintain a license revocation proceeding and the applicable regulation was not unconstitutionally vague. Alcoholic Beverage Control Law &sect;&sect; 17 and 118 authorize revocation of a license &quot;for cause.&quot; The term &quot;for cause&quot; has been held not to be vague, and &quot;improper conduct,&quot; as used in Rules of the State Liquor Authority (9 NYCRR) &sect; 53.1 (n), is not so dissimilar as to be unconstitutionally vague. The improper conduct which serves as the basis of a license sanction under the regulation will need to be of such a character and quality that it supports a finding of &quot;cause&quot; under Alcoholic Beverage Control Law &sect;&sect; 17 and 118. Given the statutory authority, a determination with regard to cause should be made through the administrative process first, followed by judicial review, if necessary, rather than prohibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies -- Proceeding to Revoke Liquor License</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs/petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing a combined action/proceeding to prohibit defendant/respondent New York State Liquor Authority from moving forward with its proceeding to revoke plaintiffs/petitioners' license to operate a liquor store, or justify an exception to the exhaustion rule by demonstrating that defendant/respondent was acting wholly beyond its grant of power, resort to an administrative remedy would be futile, or pursuit of an administrative remedy would cause irreparable injury. The mere assertion of a constitutional violation does not excuse a party from pursuing available administrative remedies. Here, facts must be developed at a hearing to establish the nature and extent of any alleged violation of sister state laws by the sale of alcoholic beverages to out-of-state purchasers, and any alleged infringement of the Commerce Clause. The irreparable injury claimed by plaintiffs/petitioners was loss of revenue and loss of their license to operate a liquor store. Because any harm caused by defendant/respondent would primarily be economic, plaintiffs/petitioners have not alleged that they could not be made whole by way of a civil claim for monetary damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-With respect to defendant's motion for a Frye hearing on shaken baby syndrome, also known as abusive head trauma (SBS/AHT), defendant's claim that the relevant scientific community was biomechanics rather than medicine lacked merit because numerous courts recognized physicians as qualified to give expert testimony on SBS/AHT; [2]-Further, there was no basis to hold a hearing because New York case law, as well as many other authorities, recognized SBS/AHT as being generally accepted in the relevant scientific community; [3]-Defendant's constitutional challenge to Penal Law &sect; 120.02 lacked merit because he failed to provide notice to the Attorney General pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 71, and his conclusory allegation did not overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution for murder and reckless assault of a child under Penal Law &sect; 120.02, the relevant scientific community to look to in determining whether shaken baby syndrome (SBS), also known as abusive head trauma (AHT), was generally accepted under the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Frye</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> test was the field of medicine, and not the field of biomechanics. Physicians are not limited to diagnosing conditions and, rather, testify frequently in court regarding causes of injury and death in a wide variety of criminal and civil matters. Further, numerous courts had recognized physicians as being qualified to give expert testimony regarding whether a child had SBS/AHT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-- Evidence -- Scientific Evidence -- General Acceptability of Shaken Baby Syndrome/Abusive Head Trauma -- Necessity of Frye Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution for murder and reckless assault of a child under Penal Law &sect; 120.02, defendant's request for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Frye</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing on shaken baby syndrome (SBS), also known as abusive head trauma (AHT), was denied as SBS/AHT was generally accepted in the relevant scientific community and numerous cases recognized it as legitimate. A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Frye</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing is not required where the expert testimony offered does not involve any novel procedures or innovative scientific theories and need not be held where the court can rely on previous rulings in other court proceedings to aid it in determining the admissibility of the proffered testimony. While there was evidence that there had been a shift in mainstream medical opinion with competing medical opinions regarding SBS/AHT, it was not the job of the court to decide which expert's conclusions were correct or to verify the soundness of scientific conclusions. As the evidence did not demonstrate that there was no basis in fact for SBS/AHT, as SBS/AHT continued to be recognized by governmental and other nationally renowned organizations, and as the legal precedent for its recognition included cases which postdated much of the research cited by defendant, it could not be said that SBS/AHT was debunked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The amendment to Executive Law &sect; 259-c(14), enacted after a sex offender's conviction, which would require him to quit his place of residence and stay out of an entire borough, violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10's Ex Post Facto Clause as applied him, as the lack of individual assessment, in light of the substantial restrictions placed on his residence and movements, rendered the statute punitive in effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender's petition was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Sex Offenders -- Prohibition against Entering School Grounds -- Ex Post Facto Punishment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive Law &sect; 259-c (14), which prohibits certain conditionally released sex offenders whose victims were under the age of 18 from knowingly entering into or upon any &quot;school grounds&quot; as defined in Penal Law &sect; 220.00 (14), violated the Ex Post Facto Clause as applied to petitioner, who was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse for his assault of a 17-year-old victim committed before section 259-c (14) was enacted. Given that section 259-c (14) as applied to petitioner was on a par with banishment as it prohibited him from entering a substantial portion of Brooklyn, where he lived with his fianc|fee and her children and near other close family members, the lack of individual assessment in applying section 259-c (14) to petitioner rendered its civil prohibition punitive in effect. In determining whether a statute can be deemed an ex post facto law, a court must ascertain whether the legislature intended the statute to be civil or punitive in nature, and the court can reject the legislature's manifest intent only where the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate the legislature's intention to deem it civil. Although section 259-c (14) categorically grouped petitioner here with all other sex offenders whose victims were under the age of 18, petitioner's victim was 17 years of age at the time he, at 22 years old, assaulted her and arguably could be considered not to be a child. While section 259-c (14) likewise viewed and treated petitioner in the same light as sex offenders deemed to present high risks of danger to children, petitioner was, upon his conditional release from imprisonment, designated a low risk by the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders.</SPAN></P>

Their allegation that &sect; 2023-a would result in greater disparities between school districts not give rise to a claim under the Education Article, N.Y. Const. art. XI, and as they did not allege the State failed to provide resources, their art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs, a union representing public and private sector employees and retirees, and eight individuals who were variously state residents and taxpayers, parents of children who attend public schools, and voters in their local school elections, had standing to bring an action seeking to declare unconstitutional New York's &quot;tax cap&quot; legislation as it applies to public school districts (Education Law &sect; 2023-a, as added by L 2011, ch 97). Under Education Law &sect; 2023-a and General Municipal Law &sect; 3-c, governmental entities seeking to levy taxes in excess of the allowable tax levy limit must obtain the approval of at least 60% of a local government's governing body or, in the case of a school district, the district voters. The majority of plaintiff union's members resided in New York, were qualified to vote in their school district elections, and, in some cases, had children who attended New York's public schools. Two of the individual plaintiffs also sued on behalf of their children who were public school students, four were teachers in state public schools, and all eight claimed to have voted in favor of local school budgets that included a tax levy in excess of the tax levy limit and failed to garner the 60% vote necessary for passage. The concerns of plaintiffs over the impact of the legislation on them were sufficient to gain them standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. Additionally, if standing were denied, an important constitutional issue would be effectively insulated from judicial review.</SPAN></P>

In an action seeking to declare unconstitutional New York's &quot;tax cap&quot; legislation as it applies to public school districts (Education Law &sect; 2023-a, as added by L 2011, ch 97), the complaint was dismissed as against defendant Governor, defendant Comptroller, and defendant Education Commissioner as the complaint, even when liberally construed, failed to include allegations of personal involvement by any of the individual defendants.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiffs' complaint seeking to declare unconstitutional New York's &quot;tax cap&quot; legislation as it applies to public school districts (Education Law &sect; 2023-a, as added by L 2011, ch 97) failed to state a cause of action under the Education Article of the State Constitution (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1). The crux of plaintiffs' claim was that Education Law &sect; 2023-a erodes local control of education spending, which has the effect of limiting educational opportunity everywhere, with a disproportionate impact on the poorest districts. In order to state a cause of action under the Education Article, a plaintiff must allege that the State failed to provide him or her a sound basic education in that it provided deficient inputs, such as teaching facilities and instrumentalities of learning, which led to deficient outputs, such as test results and graduation rates, and that the failure was causally connected to the funding system. Plaintiffs did not allege any failure of the State to provide resources, financial or otherwise. Rather, the claim was one step removed from a true Education Article claim in that plaintiffs argued that the State has created a statute which makes it harder for a district to raise funds above a certain threshold. Since the decision to raise funds lies with the voters, the State itself is not withholding any resources that deprive students of a sound basic education. Nor does the statute deprive a district from exercising local control, as a budget turned down by district voters is still an exercise of local control.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs' complaint seeking to declare unconstitutional New York's &quot;tax cap&quot; legislation as it applies to public school districts (Education Law &sect; 2023-a, as added by L 2011, ch 97) failed to state a cause of action under the Equal Protection Clauses of the New York and United States Constitutions. Under Education Law &sect; 2023-a and General Municipal Law &sect; 3-c, governmental entities seeking to levy taxes in excess of the allowable tax levy limit must obtain the approval of at least 60% of a local government's governing body or, in the case of a school district, the district voters. As education is not a fundamental right, rational basis is the proper test to apply to an equal protection challenge. The State has a legitimate interest in retaining jobs and business in New York, and that constituted a plausible reason for the statute. Even if the town boards and those that vote on school district budgets were found to be &quot;similarly situated&quot; in that they both can be categorized as involving budget approval, they are not being treated differently under the statute. Rather, the tax cap's supermajority requirement applies to both. Nor does the 60% supermajority requirement violate the Equal Protection Clause, as there is no discrete and objectively identifiable class of protected voters that are impacted by the tax cap's supermajority provision.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs' complaint seeking to declare unconstitutional New York's &quot;tax cap&quot; legislation as it applies to public school districts (Education Law &sect; 2023-a, as added by L 2011, ch 97) failed to state a cause of action for violation of the principle of &quot;one-person, one-vote.&quot; Under Education Law &sect; 2023-a and General Municipal Law &sect; 3-c, governmental entities seeking to levy taxes in excess of the allowable tax levy limit must obtain the approval of at least 60% of a local government's governing body or, in the case of a school district, the district voters. The one-person, one-vote apportionment principle does not carry with it a federal constitutional command that all State school bond and tax levy elections must be decided by a simple majority vote of the voters participating in such an election. So long as a discrete and insular minority has not been singled out for special treatment, there is nothing that requires that a majority always prevail on every issue.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs' complaint seeking to declare unconstitutional New York's &quot;tax cap&quot; legislation as it applies to public school districts (Education Law &sect; 2023-a, as added by L 2011, ch 97) failed to state a cause of action for violation of freedom of expression (NY Const, art I, &sect; 8; US Const 1st Amend). Under Education Law &sect; 2023-a and General Municipal Law &sect; 3-c, governmental entities seeking to levy taxes in excess of the allowable tax levy limit must obtain the approval of at least 60% of a local government's governing body or, in the case of a school district, the district voters. Plaintiffs alleged that the legislation diminished their voting power as compared to those who oppose increased spending; required the placement of an anti-increase message on ballots, effectively encouraging voters to vote &quot;no&quot;; and imposed adverse consequences on school boards and voters who try, unsuccessfully, to pierce the cap. Plaintiffs' voting power was not diminished, as there is no requirement that a majority always prevail on every issue. The ballot statement required by Education Law &sect; 2023-a (6) (b) governs the ballot process and does not regulate speech, and the language conveys neutral facts which are necessary to inform the voter of the impact of his or her vote. Finally, even if Education Law &sect; 2023-a (6) (b) in particular, and the supermajority requirement of the tax cap in general, makes it more difficult for plaintiffs' positions to succeed, that was irrelevant under a First Amendment analysis since there was nothing stopping plaintiffs from making their case to the voting public in whatever ways they might choose.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs' complaint seeking to declare unconstitutional New York's &quot;tax cap&quot; legislation as it applies to public school districts (Education Law &sect; 2023-a, as added by L 2011, ch 97) failed to state a cause of action for violation of substantive due process under the New York and United States Constitutions. Under Education Law &sect; 2023-a and General Municipal Law &sect; 3-c, governmental entities seeking to levy taxes in excess of the allowable tax levy limit must obtain the approval of at least 60% of a local government's governing body or, in the case of a school district, the district voters. A statute which still places the ability to control a school budget in the hands of voters, albeit by a supermajority margin, does not infringe or interfere with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an appropriation action seeking a declaration that claimant was entitled to just compensation for defendant's alleged unconstitutional taking of claimant's property, defendant was not entitled to dismissal of the claim on timeliness grounds where it failed to interpose an answer asserting that defense. Court of Claims Act &sect; 11 (c) provides that a defense based upon failure to comply with the statute of limitations is waived unless raised in the answer or a pre-answer motion to dismiss. Therefore, although a defendant need not submit an answer in an appropriation claim if it merely wants to deny the allegations of the claim (22 NYCRR 206.7), if a defendant wishes to assert a statute of limitations defense, then it must comply with the statute or the defense is waived. The court rule merely states that an answer is not required in order for the allegations of the claim to be deemed denied. It does not state or imply that an answer or a dismissal motion is not required to raise an affirmative defense, and cannot be held to abrogate the statutory mandate set forth in section 11 (c).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The denial of claimant's application for approval to build on its lakeshore property, whose only productive economic use was construction of a residential subdivision, because the property was subject to regulations prohibiting subsurface sanitary waste disposal systems within 300 feet of the lake did not effect an unconstitutional taking for which claimant was entitled to just compensation, where the regulations had been in force at the time claimant purchased the property. Where the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial use, it may resist compensation only where the antecedent inquiry into the nature of the owner's estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of the owner's title to begin with. The land here had been subject to the restrictions preventing residential development for over 80 years, and claimant therefore did not establish a categorical or per se taking. Nothing was taken from claimant to which it had an &quot;of right&quot; entitlement at the time of purchase. Moreover, claimant failed to provide support for the theory that its claim traveled with the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ISSUE: Whether an appearance summons charging defendant with violating Village of Massapequa Park, N.Y., Code &sect; 279-3, by residing as a registered sex offender within one mile of schools and parks, was to be dismissed. HOLDINGS: [1]-The court was unable to determine whether defendant resided at the subject premises pursuant to an order of a county court issued on the date that he was alleged to have violated the provision; [2]-The requirement of written notice to defendant and an opportunity to relocate contemplated by the provision rendered the regulation prospective; [3]-The court found that Village of Massapequa Park, N.Y., Code &sect; 279-3, as applied to defendant, was preempted by the New York Sex Offender Registration Act, Correction Law &sect; 168 et seq., because he was serving a court imposed sentence of probation under the supervision of a county probation department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appearance summons and information dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-- Sex Offenders -- Residency Restrictions -- Residing at Premises Pursuant to Court Order Approving Conditions of Probation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, a level one sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration Act (Correction Law art 6-C), was not entitled to dismissal of an information charging him with violating Code of the Village of Massapequa Park &sect; 279-3, which prohibited registered sex offenders from residing within one mile of a school, on the ground that defendant resided at the premises pursuant to a County Court order approving the conditions of his probation and thus permitting him to remain at the residence. Absent from the record was proof of the date on which defendant was first permitted by the Probation Department to remain at the premises, or of when that condition was first approved by County Court. Thus, it could not be held, as a matter of fact, that defendant resided at the premises pursuant to County Court's order on the date of the alleged violation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Sex Offenders -- Residency Restrictions -- Establishment of Residence Prior to Enactment of Local Law Restricting Residency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The information charging defendant, a level one sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration Act (Correction Law art 6-C), with violating Code of the Village of Massapequa Park &sect; 279-3, which prohibited registered sex offenders from &quot;establish[ing] a residence&quot; within one mile of a school, based on the allegation that defendant &quot;resid[ed]&quot; within a restricted location, was facially sufficient. Even if defendant had established his residence before the enactment of Village Code &sect; 279-3, the Village Board, prior to defendant's alleged violation, repealed the local law which made the residency restrictions of section 279-3 inapplicable to offenders who had established their residences prior to its enactment. Moreover, pursuant to Village Code &sect; 279-3, each day an offender continued to reside within a restricted area constituted a separate violation subject to a fine. Thus, although the regulation expressly restricted the establishment of a residence, the scheme, history and purpose of Village Code chapter 279 reflected an intent to also prohibit registered sex offenders from continuing to reside within a restricted area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-- Sex Offenders -- Residency Restrictions -- Local Law Preempted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant, a level one sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) (Correction Law art 6-C) who lived 1,360 feet from a school, was entitled to dismissal of an information charging him with violating Code of the Village of Massapequa Park &sect; 279-3, which prohibited registered sex offenders from residing within one mile of a school, as that local law was preempted by state law precluding certain sex offenders on probation from residing within 1,000 feet of a school (Penal Law &sect;&sect; 65.10 [4-a]; 220.00 [14]). New York's preemption doctrine precludes local legislation where an express conflict exists between state and local laws, or where the state has clearly evinced a desire to preempt an entire field. By way of SORA, the state legislature enacted a comprehensive and detailed regulatory scheme regarding the registration and regulation of sex offenders who are on probation, thus demonstrating an intent to preempt more restrictive local laws regulating the same subject matter. As defendant was on probation, SORA's residency restrictions preempted those imposed by Village Code &sect; 279-3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-An agency's demand for payment of a $ 1,000 fine, as a condition of the business license renewal, was in excess of its authority as Administrative Code of the City of NY &sect;&sect; 20-101 and 20-104(e)(3) were interpreted in a manner not supported by their plain language as the city had not bestowed the agency with the power to decline to renew a pedicab business license based on the owner's failure to pay fines assessed in connection with a pedicab driver's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petition granted, in part; agency determination denying the driver a renewal of his business license was annulled; matter was remitted to the agency for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the receipt by petitioner, a pedicab owner and driver, of a violation in connection with his pedicab driver's license and the imposition of a fine relating thereto, the demand by respondent Department of Consumer Affairs for payment of the fine as a condition of renewing petitioner's pedicab business license was in excess of its authority as that agency is not bestowed with the power to decline to renew a pedicab business license based on the owner's failure to pay fines assessed in connection with a pedicab driver's license. The agency cited no case law to suggest that petitioner's refusal to pay the fine implicated his honesty and integrity under Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 20-101, especially where his defiance was based on a concern that payment of the fine would &quot;moot out&quot; his opportunity to vindicate his constitutional rights relating to the underlying violation. Moreover, while the agency has authority to &quot;suspend the license of any person pending payment of such fine or civil penalty&quot; under Administrative Code &sect; 20-104 (e) (3), that section ties the fine to the particular license under which the fine was issued&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by its reference to &quot;the license&quot; and &quot;such&quot; fine, and that section, by its terms, relates only to a suspension of a license without any indication that it applies to a renewal. Finally, a review of other Administrative Code provisions relating specifically to violations by pedicab drivers, which place certain obligations but not others on pedicab owners, indicated that the legislature did not intend to hold a pedicab owner responsible for fines incurred by a pedicab driver, even when the business is operated by the driver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Petitioner, whose application for a new driver's license was denied by the DMV, filed suit challenging regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles regarding drivers, like her, who had multiple DUIs. There was no conflict between Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193(2)(b)(12)(b) (regulating DUI-related license revocations) and 15 NYCRR pt. 136 (same), as no legislative policy required the Commissioner to abandon her discretion with respect to the decision to reissue a revoked license; [2]-In adopting pt. 136, the Commissioner did not invade the province of the legislature, as it had explicitly granted her exclusive administrative authority over the revocation and issuance of driver licenses; [3]-The Commission's temporary suspension of the review of new license applications until after pt. 136 took effect was within her inherent discretionary authority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Department of Motor Vehicles Relicensure Regulations -- Waiver of Permanent License Revocation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Revised 15 NYCRR part 136 (eff Sept. 25, 2012), imposing an additional, five-year waiting period before a relicensing application will be granted where a driver's license was revoked for an alcohol- or drug-related driving offense and the driver had three or four such offenses within a 25-year look-back period (15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [3]), does not conflict with Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (b) (12) (b), directing waiver after five years of the &quot;permanent&quot; license revocation required by section 1193 (2) (b) (12) (a) for certain alcohol- and drug-related driving offenses, or section 1193 (2) (b) (12) (e), permitting waiver after eight years of the &quot;permanent&quot; license revocation required by section 1193 (2) (b) (12) (d) for certain alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses. Under section 1193 (2) (b) (12) (b), the waiver of a &quot;permanent&quot; license revocation is subject to a case by case review by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles in the interest of public safety and welfare, and section 1193 (2) (b) (12) (e) likewise does not require restoration of a permanently revoked license. Thus, waiver is not mandated so long as the Commissioner exercises his or her discretion. Moreover, the Commissioner has been delegated broad authority to oversee the relicensing of revoked driver's licenses, and the revocation periods set forth in section 1193 (2) (b) are expressly described as &quot;minimum periods.&quot; Finally, section 1193 (2) (b) (12) (c) provides for the conditional or restricted operation of a motor vehicle after certain mandatory revocation periods subject to such criteria, terms and conditions as established by the Commissioner, and 15 NYCRR 136.5 (b) (3)'s waiting period merely delays issuance of a conditional or restricted license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Department of Motor Vehicles Relicensure Regulations -- Ignition Interlock Device</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Revised 15 NYCRR part 136's (eff Sept. 25, 2012) requirement, upon the relicensing of a driver whose license was revoked for an alcohol- or drug-related driving offense, for installation of an ignition interlock device (IID), in connection with issuance of an A2 restricted license, on vehicles owned or operated by the driver (15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [3]) does not conflict with Penal Law &sect; 65.10 (2) (k-1) or Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1198 (2), which, respectively, expressly authorize and direct a court, when imposing a sentence of probation or conditional discharge in connection with certain alcohol-related driving offenses, to require installation of an IID. Given the legislative policy to uniformly require installation of an IID after conviction of most alcohol-related driving offenses (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 60.21), the administrative imposition of an IID requirement in connection with the issuance of a conditional or restrictive license following the revocation of a driver's license for an alcohol- or drug-related driving offense is merely a rational extension of such policy, and the legislature conferred sufficient authority upon the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to adopt revised part 136's IID requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Department of Motor Vehicles Relicensure Regulations -- Lifetime Review and Look-Back Periods</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Revised 15 NYCRR part 136's (eff Sept. 25, 2012) directive that, upon an application for relicensing following the revocation of a driver's license for an alcohol- or drug-related driving offense, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles conduct a lifetime review of the driver's driving record (15 NYCRR 136.5 [b]) and its imposition of lifetime (15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [1]) and 25-year (15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [2], [3]) look-back periods in determining whether the Commissioner should grant or deny the relicensing application do not conflict with numerous provisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law imposing lesser look-back periods. The mere fact that the legislature, in limited circumstances and unrelated contexts, imposed its own look-back periods does not prohibit the Commissioner from administratively imposing different ones for other purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Department of Motor Vehicles Relicensure Regulations -- Lifetime Denial of Relicensing Application</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Revised 15 NYCRR part 136 (eff Sept. 25, 2012), permitting the lifetime denial of an application for relicensing where the driver has five or more alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses in his or her lifetime (15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [1]) or three or four such offenses and one or more serious driving offenses within a 25-year look-back period (15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [2]), does not conflict with Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (c) (3), imposing a lifetime prohibition with respect to the issuance of a new license where the driver has been twice convicted of certain alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses and physical injury resulted from each incident. Although the legislature, through section 1193 (2) (c) (3), spoke with regard to how a relicensing application should be handled in one specific situation, the language of that section does not establish a legislative intent to prevent the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, in the exercise of his or her broad discretion, from imposing a lifetime restriction on relicensing in other appropriate circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Department of Motor Vehicles Relicensure Regulations -- Separation of Powers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The adoption by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of revised 15 NYCRR part 136 (eff Sept. 25, 2012), which governs relicensing following the revocation of a driver's license for, among other things, alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses, did not overstep the line between administrative rulemaking and legislative policymaking so as to violate the separation of powers doctrine. In determining whether administrative action is in contravention of the separation of powers doctrine, courts consider whether the agency acted within its legislatively delegated policy goals, whether the agency was merely filling in the details of broad legislation describing the overall policies to be implemented, whether the legislature repeatedly tried but failed to adopt legislation in the area and whether the agency has special expertise in the area. Here, revised part 136 falls squarely within the policy and purpose of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which is to protect public safety and welfare, and it was not adopted pursuant to extraneous social or economic policy issues. The legislature properly delegated the Commissioner exclusive administrative authority over the issuance of driver's licenses, and revised part 136 merely carries out that legislatively delegated authority. Despite a single, prior attempt, the legislature has not repeatedly failed to legislate in the area of relicensing, and public safety and welfare with regard to the operation of motor vehicles upon state roadways is a matter within the Commissioner's technical competence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Department of Motor Vehicles Relicensure Regulations -- Legislative Preemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The adoption by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of revised 15 NYCRR part 136 (eff Sept. 25, 2012), which governs relicensing following the revocation of a driver's license for, among other things, alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses, did not violate the principle of legislative preemption. No provision of the Vehicle and Traffic Law expressly precludes or limits the promulgation of rules or regulations with regard to the reissuance of previously revoked driver's licenses, and, given that the legislature granted the Commissioner broad powers with regard to rulemaking and discretionary review in that area, revised part 136 is not inconsistent or out of harmony with the Vehicle and Traffic Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Department of Motor Vehicles Relicensure Regulations -- Ex Post Facto Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Revised 15 NYCRR part 136 (eff Sept. 25, 2012), which governs relicensing following the revocation of a driver's license for, among other things, alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses, did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, which prohibits legislation making criminal an act not criminal when committed or increasing the punishment for a previously committed offense, as the purpose of revised part 136 is to protect the public safety and welfare, not to impose punitive sanctions. Incidental thereto, although in anticipation of revised part 136's promulgation all pending relicensing applications were temporarily held by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to be reviewed in a uniform fashion under the new regulations, petitioner's relicensing application, which ultimately was denied pursuant to 15 NYCRR 136.5 (b) (3), was subject to review under revised part 136 as it had not been finally determined as of the time revised part 136 became effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Department of Motor Vehicles Relicensure Regulations -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Upon the revocation of her driver's license for an alcohol-related driving offense, petitioner's due process rights were not implicated by the denial of her application for relicensing pursuant to revised 15 NYCRR part 136. Although a driver's license is a substantial property interest that may not be deprived without due process of law, that due process right arises only where the applicant has a legitimate claim of entitlement to the license, not merely a unilateral expectation. Here, given that her license previously was revoked, petitioner possessed, at best, a unilateral expectation that she would receive a new license, not a bona fide right thereto. Further, while there is no due process right to a particular state-created review procedure, sufficient protections were made available to petitioner to fulfill the requirements of procedural due process concerning review of her relicensing application by way of an administrative appeal and CPLR article 78 review of the adverse administrative determination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney General </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-- Subpoena Power -- Factual Basis for Issuance of Subpoena</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Upon petitioner's application to quash a subpoena served pursuant to an investigation by the Attorney General relating to petitioner's clients, individuals who rent their apartments located in New York City and State as lodging accommodations via petitioner's Internet platform, a factual predicate for issuance of the subpoena, which sought information identifying petitioner's clients, their accommodations, the dates and durations of guest stay, the rates charged and payment methods, their revenues through petitioner's website and their tax-related communications with the website, was established by evidence that a substantial number of petitioner's clients might be in violation of the Multiple Dwelling Law and/or New York City and/or State tax provisions. Under Multiple Dwelling Law &sect; 4 (8) (a), a class A multiple dwelling can only be used for permanent residence purposes, which requires occupancy of the unit by the same person or family for at least 30 consecutive days. Nevertheless, an investigator with the Attorney General's Internet Bureau, who conducted searches of petitioner's website, averred that petitioner's clients were violating the Multiple Dwelling Law by renting their class A multiple dwelling residences to guests for periods of less than 30 days while not also residing therein. Moreover, anyone operating a hotel in New York City must collect a hotel room occupancy tax (HOT) and file a certificate of registration with the New York City Department of Finance, yet the Bureau Chief for the Attorney General's Taxpayer Protection Bureau affirmed that a review of the certificates of registration revealed that the vast majority of petitioner's clients were not paying HOT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney General</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Subpoena Power -- Overbreadth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Upon petitioner's application to quash a subpoena served pursuant to an investigation by the Attorney General relating to petitioner's clients, individuals who rent their apartments located in New York City and State as lodging accommodations via petitioner's Internet platform, the subpoena, which requested information for &quot;all Hosts that rent Accommodation(s) in New York State,&quot; sought materials that were irrelevant to the inquiry and was thus overbroad. Although a factual predicate existed for issuance of the subpoena based on potential violations of the Multiple Dwelling Law relating to the rental of class A multiple dwelling units for periods of less than 30 days, the Multiple Dwelling Law applies only to large cities or cities, towns or villages that have adopted its provisions. The subpoena, however, was not limited to petitioner's New York City clients or those who reside in cities, towns or villages that have adopted the Multiple Dwelling Law, nor was it limited to rentals of less than 30 days. A further factual predicate existed based on potential noncompliance with state and local tax provisions, such as the New York City hotel room occupancy tax (HOT) and the New York State sales tax, yet the subpoena did not take into account exceptions to the tax provisions, including that a facility is not considered a &quot;hotel&quot; for purposes of HOT where it is rented on fewer than three occasions or for not more than 14 days during the year and that the New York State sales tax applies only to buildings regularly used and kept open as &quot;hotels&quot; for the lodging of guests. The subpoena did not provide any limitation on petitioner's clients by, for example, exempting those who used the website only once or for very limited periods.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Upon petitioner's application to quash a subpoena served pursuant to an investigation by the Attorney General relating to petitioner's clients, individuals who rent their apartments located in New York City and State as lodging accommodations via petitioner's Internet platform, petitioner failed to demonstrate that the subpoena, which sought information identifying petitioner's clients, their accommodations, the dates and durations of guest stay, the rates charged and payment methods, their revenues through petitioner's website and their tax-related communications with the website, was unduly burdensome. Petitioner, an Internet platform with hundreds of thousands of electronic records, failed to establish that such information was not collected by or readily accessible to it. Petitioner's conclusory assertions that it would be difficult to provide, among other things, the names, addresses and contact information for its clients and the addresses of the accommodations being rented, as well as tax communications, if any, that it had with its clients, were insufficient to demonstrate that the subpoena was unduly burdensome.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Upon petitioner's application to quash a subpoena served pursuant to an investigation by the Attorney General relating to petitioner's clients, individuals who rent their apartments located in New York City and State as lodging accommodations via petitioner's Internet platform, petitioner's contention that the Attorney General could not use his subpoena power as a tool for enforcing unconstitutionally vague laws was not ripe for review. Although the Attorney General's investigation was for potential violations by petitioner's clients of state and local zoning and tax laws, the Attorney General had not filed any action or attempted to enforce those laws against any individuals or entities. In determining whether a matter is ripe for judicial review, the action must impose an obligation, deny a right or fix some legal relationship as a consummation of the administrative process and there must be a finding that the apparent harm inflicted by the action may not be prevented or significantly ameliorated by further administrative action or by steps available to the complaining party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Upon petitioner's application to quash a subpoena served pursuant to an investigation by the Attorney General relating to petitioner's clients, individuals who rent their apartments located in New York City and State as lodging accommodations via petitioner's Internet platform, petitioner failed to demonstrate that the information requested by the subpoena--identifying petitioner's clients, their accommodations, the dates and durations of guest stay, the rates charged and payment methods, their revenues through petitioner's website and their tax-related communications with the website--was confidential. Petitioner's privacy policy provided that it would disclose any information in its sole discretion that it believed was necessary to respond to, among other things, subpoenas. Moreover, to the extent the subpoena requested tax-related communications between petitioner's clients and the website, including tax inquiries or tax document requests initiated by petitioner or its clients, petitioner failed to establish adequate legal authority to preclude the request or that the subpoena was requesting the disclosure of petitioner's clients' tax returns.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner's application pursuant to Domestic Relations Law &sect; 115, to adopt twins who were conceived with the genetic material of his spouse and a donor, and carried to term by a surrogate mother, was not foreclosed merely by the existence of the surrogacy contract and instead was approved in the best interests of the children. New York State has deemed surrogacy contracts to be against public policy and void and unenforceable (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 122). A surrogacy contract alone, however, will not foreclose an adoption of a child born under it from proceeding. Here, there was no conflict over the children's care and custody; the surrogate mother had intended from the outset to relinquish her parental rights; and the adoption did not require the court to enforce the surrogacy contract, as it was unrelated to the surrogacy agreement itself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles--Revocation or Suspension of Operator's License--Applications for Relicensure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent Department of Motor Vehicles did not act arbitrarily and capriciously or abuse its discretion in denying petitioner's application for relicensure as a driver, pursuant to 15 NYCRR former 136.5 (b) (eff Sept. 25, 2012). Only respondent may restore a driver's license after it has been revoked (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 510 [5]), and once a rational basis for the administrative determination is shown, it must be upheld even if the court may have reached a contrary result. Here, respondent rationally found that petitioner's driving record, which included three alcohol- or drug-related incidents or convictions as well as several other violations and accidents, showed a serious lack of regard for the safety and welfare of other drivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">--Ex Post Facto Law--Prohibition In-applicable to Civil Remedies--Regulations Governing Reissuance of Revoked Driver's Licenses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent Department of Motor Vehicles' denial of petitioner's application for relicensure as a driver pursuant to revised 15 NYCRR 136.5 (a) (3) and (b) (3) (i) (eff Sept. 25, 2012), instead of the regulation as in effect at the time of his last alcohol-related offense, did not constitute an impermissible retroactive application of the regulations or an impermissible ex post facto penalty. The Ex Post Facto Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 10, cl 1) prohibits states from enacting laws that punish as crimes acts that were innocent when committed or retroactively increase the punishment for criminal acts. However, it applies only to penal statutes, not to civil remedies that seek to protect the public, as here. The amendments were part of an effort to strengthen respondent's authority to deny relicensing to problem drivers for the safety of the public, and they were not so punitive in effect as to negate the non-punitive intent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law--Timeliness of Administrative Actions and Proceedings--Challenge to Timeliness Based on Due Process of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner's due process rights were not violated in the context of respondent Department of Motor Vehicles' denial, based on revised 15 NYCRR 136.5 (eff Sept. 25, 2012), of his application for relicensure as a driver, regardless of whether respondent purposely delayed the application until the amended regulations became effective. The regulations were sufficiently precise to put drivers on notice that relicensing applications may be denied based on three alcohol-related offenses. Moreover, any due process claim that petitioner may have had based on respondent's decision to hold his application in anticipation of the new regulations was moot, as respondent's determination had been rendered. To contest the timeliness of the determination, petitioner would have been required to seek a writ of mandamus to compel, ordering respondent to render the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">--Rule Making--Statutory Authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Respondent Department of Motor Vehicles acted within its broad statutory authority and discretion in amending 15 NYCRR part 136, concerning the licensing or relicensing of drivers after revocation, to lengthen the look-back period for reviewing a driver's record and periods of revocation. The legislature has conferred broad discretionary power on respondent over the reissuance of licenses that have been revoked by reason of alcohol- or drug-related convictions or test refusals (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 [2] [b] [3], [12] [b]; [2] [c]), including the authority to refuse to reissue a license after a mandatory minimum period of revocation (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect;&sect; 1193 [2] [b] [12]; [c]; 510 [6]).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a proceeding commenced by petitioner to challenge respondent Department of Motor Vehicles' denial of his application for reissuance of his driver's license based on his history of six alcohol related driving convictions, petitioner failed to demonstrate that respondent's amendment of 15 NYCRR 136.5 (a) (3) and (b) (1)effecting a ban on re-licensure for individuals with five or more alcohol or drug related driving convictions or incidents in their lifetime--upon which respondent relied in denying petitioner's application, lacked a rational basis and was unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious. Respondent's Commissioner has broad, explicit and exclusive administrative authority over the issuance of driver's licenses and authority to adopt the rules and regulations to carry out respondent's functions. Given the statutorily authorized discretion granted the Commissioner to refuse to issue a license after a mandatory minimum period of revocation (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 [2] [c] [1]), it cannot be concluded that the legislature intended to limit the Commissioner's authority to impose a lifetime restriction to only one circumstance or that respondent exceeded its authority and acted outside of the law in issuing the amendments. Moreover, it was entirely rational to subject applicants with multiple offenses to stricter scrutiny given the Commissioner's statutory responsibility to promote highway safety and to prevent death and injuries caused by impaired or intoxicated drivers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a proceeding commenced by petitioner to challenge respondent Department of Motor Vehicles' denial of his application for reissuance of his driver's license based on his history of six alcohol related driving convictions, the amendments to 15 NYCRR 136.5 (a) (3) and (b) (1)--effecting a ban on re-licensure for individuals with five or more alcohol or drug related driving convictions or incidents in their lifetime--upon which respondent relied and applied retroactively in denying petitioner's application, did not violate the ex post facto doctrine. The amendments, made after petitioner applied for re-licensure, were civil requirements for becoming licensed (a privilege), the purpose of which was not to punish petitioner for crimes previously committed, but to reasonably regulate a problem driver's access to a driver's license. </SPAN></P>

The Administrative Orders, which retroactively imposed additional and more stringent procedural burdens upon foreclosing plaintiffs, are invalid as they are inconsistent with the prospective certification requirements of CPLR 3012-b, which are markedly less onerous with respect to the nature of the disclosures required. That the legislature chose to impose CPLR 3012-b's certification requirements prospectively, rather than retroactively, did not leave pending cases unregulated by statute or give rise to any administrative authority to impose more stringent vouching requirements in such cases but was evidence of the legislature's intention not to saddle plaintiffs in prior commenced actions with any vouching requirements. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ISSUE: Whether petitioner, convicted of raping a young child, was entitled to a judgment prohibiting the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision from enforcing Executive Law &sect; 259-c(14) against him and declaring unconstitutional its provision preventing him from traveling or living within 1,000 feet of a school. HOLDINGS: [1]-The legislature enacted &sect; 259-c(14) to protect children from harm and not to increase punishment, and it was not so punitive in its effect as to negate the legislature's intent; thus, its retroactive application did not violate U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10's Ex Post Facto Clause; [2]-Given the nature of petitioner's crime and his parolee status, the restriction against entering within 1,000 feet of a school was rationally related to the legitimate state objective of protecting children; thus, &sect; 259-c(14) did not violate his substantive due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Residency Restrictions -- Ex Post Facto Clause&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Executive Law &sect; 259-c (14) (as amended by L 2005, ch 544), which prohibits certain paroled sex offenders from entering into or upon any &quot;school grounds&quot; as defined in Penal Law &sect; 220.00 (14), is not an unconstitutional ex post facto law on its face or as applied to petitioner, who had committed his sex offenses before the enactment of Executive Law &sect; 259-c (14) and was prohibited, as a condition of his parole, from living or traveling within 1,000 feet of a school. In determining whether a statute renders the punishment for a crime more burdensome for purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause, the United States Supreme Court has implemented an intent-effects test. Under the first prong of this test, the court determines whether the legislature intended the statute to be punitive or civil in nature. The legislative history of the statute indicates that the legislature sought to protect children from harm and not to increase punishment against sex offenders. Under the second prong of the test, the court determines whether the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate the legislature's intention to deem it civil. Petitioner's argument that he was banished from most of New York City was contradicted by the map that he himself provided. Moreover, the restriction was not similar to the historical punishment of banishment. It merely placed a temporary restriction, which was to expire at the completion of petitioner's sentence, on how close he may live to a school.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Residency Restrictions -- Due Process </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Executive Law &sect; 259-c (14) (as amended by L 2005, ch 544), which prohibits certain paroled sex offenders from entering into or upon any &quot;school grounds&quot; as defined in Penal Law &sect; 220.00 (14), is rationally and reasonably related to the permissible and legitimate state objective of protecting children, and did not violate petitioner parolee's substantive due process rights. Petitioner was prohibited, as a condition of his parole, from living or traveling within 1,000 feet of a school, a restriction that limited his choice of residence within New York City. Petitioner's posited liberty interest, the right to live where one chooses, was subject to rational basis review. Moreover, petitioner and other parolees enjoy only conditional liberty, which is dependent on observance of conditions. Even if petitioner's asserted right to travel freely within the state is a fundamental constitutional right, petitioner, as a parolee, does not enjoy an absolute right to travel. In enacting the restriction, the legislature was acting in pursuit of protecting children from harm posed by paroled sex offenders, which is a permissible state objective. By creating a 1,000-foot buffer around a school, the restriction seeks to protect children from harm by petitioner's &quot;being at large,&quot; and the restriction is temporary, ending upon completion of petitioner's term. Moreover, the statute does not impose strict liability. Incidental contact with the 1,000-foot zone of exclusion, when walking between two permissible places, does not alone constitute a violation. The statute does not, on its face, unreasonably infringe upon any constitutionally protected interest of the parolee.  </SPAN></P>

XVI, &sect; 3 against taxing a nonresident's intangible personal property, and the insistence by the Commissioner of the Department of Taxation and Finance on conformity in the characterization of the sales event, as memorialized in the 2010 amendment to Tax Law &sect; 632(a)(2), did not constitute an unconstitutional change in the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a declaratory judgment action relating to nonresident plaintiff shareholders' election to treat the sale of their stock of a Tennessee corporation as an asset sale pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) &sect; 338 (h) (10), the determination of defendant Department of Taxation and Finance that the gain from the asset sale based on the election constituted taxable New York source income pursuant to the 2010 amendment to Tax Law &sect; 632 (a) (2) was upheld. The effect of the amendment was simply to conform the characterization of the transaction as an asset sale on both the federal and New York State returns. Accordingly, treating an asset sale as New York source income does not run afoul of the constitutional prohibition against taxing the sale of intangible personal property of a nonresident under NY Constitution, article XVI, &sect; 3. Moreover, for defendant to insist on conformity in the characterization of the sales event, as memorialized in the amendment, does not constitute an unconstitutional change in the law given that the legislative history reveals that the amendment was necessary to correct contrary administrative rulings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adult sentence imposed upon defendant, who was 17 years old at the time he committed the class A-I felony of murder in the second degree (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 125.25 [3]) and related crimes, did not violate the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;US Const 8th Amend). Defendant did not qualify as a juvenile offender (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 1.20 [42]), and nothing evinced that his sentence, which included a term of life imprisonment with a mandatory minimum period of 25 years for the felony murder, was in any manner disproportionate or incommensurate with his crimes. Although the legislature recognized that an individual's youthfulness should be considered for purposes of sentencing by specifically creating the &quot;juvenile offender&quot; designation, the legislature also determined that a person 17 years of age possesses sufficient maturity to be sentenced as an adult. Moreover, age, by itself, does not prevent the imposition of a sentence for a class A-I felony on the basis of cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant was convicted of engaging in a crime spree during which he murdered the victim by shooting him in the chest and committed two armed robberies. Although only 17 years old at the time of his crimes, the havoc defendant wreaked, the brutality he savagely inflicted on others and the methodical execution of his victim exuded an abject depravity unparalleled by adults of any age. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Upon respondent Department of Motor Vehicles' denial of petitioner's application to restore his driver's license for a period of five years based on his history of three alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses, the proceeding commenced by petitioner to challenge the substance and constitutionality of certain amendments to 15 NYCRR part 136, the regulations upon which respondent relied in denying petitioner's application, was timely as it was commenced within four months of petitioner's receipt of respondent's determination denying his administrative appeal, albeit more than four months after the promulgation of the amendments. Under CPLR 217 (1), a CPLR article 78 proceeding must be commenced within four months after the determination to be reviewed becomes final and binding upon the petitioner, which is not necessarily the effective date of the regulation but rather when the challenged determination inflicts an actual, concrete injury upon the petitioner or, put another way, when it is clear that the petitioner has been aggrieved and has received notice of the challenged agency action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Rule Making -- Regulation of License Revocation and Restoration for Alcohol-- and Drug-Related Driving Offenses -- Authority to Promulgate Regulations</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding commenced by petitioner to challenge respondent Department of Motor Vehicles' denial of his application to restore his driver's license for a period of five years based on his history of three alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses, respondent did not exceed its authority in promulgating certain amendments to 15 NYCRR part 136, the regulations upon which it relied in denying petitioner's application, given respondent's special expertise and the discretionary authority granted to respondent by statute. The Vehicle and Traffic Law grants respondent's Commissioner authority to enact rules and regulations (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 215 [a]) and provides for license sanctions, including a six-month revocation, for certain alcohol- and drug-related driving offenses (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect;1193 [2] [a], [b] [2]). Where a license is revoked for an alcohol- or drug-related driving offense, the Vehicle and Traffic Law grants the Commissioner discretionary authority to refuse to reissue the license after a mandatory minimum period of revocation (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect;&sect; 1193 [2] [b] [12] [b]; [c]; 510 [5], [6]). Thus, respondent's promulgation of the 15 NYCRR part 136 amendments, mandating that a license revoked for an alcohol- or drug-related driving offense remain in revoked status for a period of five years, in addition to the statutory minimum revocation period, where the applicant has been convicted of three or four alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses within 25 years (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [3]), was not ultra vires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Rational Basis -- Regulation of License Revocation and Restoration for Alcohol-- and Drug-Related Driving Offenses </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding commenced by petitioner to challenge respondent Department of Motor Vehicles' denial of his application to restore his driver's license for a period of five years based on his history of three alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses, petitioner failed to meet his heavy burden of showing that certain amendments to 15 NYCRR part 136, the regulations upon which respondent relied in denying petitioner's application, lacked a rational basis and were unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious. The challenger of a regulation must establish that the regulation is so lacking in reason for its promulgation that it is essentially arbitrary. However, if not irrational or unreasonable, the interpretation given to a statute by an administrative agency should be upheld. Thus, the court must determine whether the regulation is rational and relates to the goals of the underlying statute. Here, the 15 NYCRR part 136 amendments, mandating that a license revoked for an alcohol- or drug-related driving offense remain in revoked status for a period of five years, in addition to the statutory minimum revocation period, where the applicant has been convicted of three or four alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses within 25 years (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [3]), were a permissible and reasonable exercise of respondent's Commissioner's broad statutory authority to promote highway safety and to prevent death and injuries caused by impaired or intoxicated drivers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a proceeding commenced by petitioner to challenge respondent Department of Motor Vehicles' denial of his application to restore his driver's license for a period of five years based on his history of three alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses, certain amendments to 15 NYCRR part 136, the regulations upon which respondent relied in denying petitioner's application, were sufficiently precise to put drivers on notice that their applications for re-licensing could be denied based on three alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses. Due process requires that a civil statute contain a reasonable degree of certainty so that individuals of ordinary intelligence are not forced to guess at the meaning of statutory terms. Here, the 15 NYCRR part 136 amendments, mandating that a license revoked for an alcohol- or drug-related driving offense remain in revoked status for a period of five years, in addition to the statutory minimum revocation period, where the applicant has been convicted of three or four alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses within 25 years (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [3]), were not too vague to give notice to drivers of the wrongful activities they should be avoiding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a proceeding commenced by petitioner to challenge respondent Department of Motor Vehicles' denial of his application to restore his driver's license for a period of five years based on his history of three alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses, certain amendments to 15 NYCRR part 136, the regulations upon which respondent relied in denying petitioner's application, did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 10). The 15 NYCRR part 136 amendments imposed civil penalties, and the revocation of petitioner's driving privilege was not so punitive as to have transformed the civil penalty into a criminal one. Although an ex post facto law increases the level of punishment beyond that which was available at the time the offense was committed, the prohibition applies only to statutes that are punitive in nature. Here, after petitioner pleaded guilty to misdemeanor driving while intoxicated, his license was revoked for the mandatory six-month period and he applied to have his license restored, respondent promulgated the 15 NYCRR part 136 amendments, mandating that a license revoked for an alcohol- or drug-related driving offense remain in revoked status for a period of five years, in addition to the statutory minimum revocation period, where the applicant has been convicted of three or four alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses within 25 years (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [3]). Nevertheless, the amendments were not so punitive in either purpose or effect so as to negate their civil purpose of regulating the right to drive and the possession of a driver's license in the furtherance of highway safety and to protect against potential injury to the public. </SPAN></P>

The court held that these laws did not violate vehicle owners' procedural due process rights because the laws advanced the legitimate government interest in public safety; the enforcement proceeding was civil in nature, since the maximum penalty was a $ 50 fine; and an owner was afforded the right to a hearing, to the assistance of counsel, to compulsory process, and to appeal; [2]-The laws' imposition of vicarious liability on vehicle owners for the actions of vehicle drivers did not infringe on a fundamental right or offend substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1111-b, which authorized defendant City of Rochester's red light camera program--a demonstration program that imposes monetary liability on the owner of a vehicle for a failure of its operator to comply with traffic control conditions if the vehicle was used with the owner's express or implied permission--and the city charter provision that implemented the program were not facially unconstitutional. The program had a rational relationship to the legitimate government interests of promoting public safety by reducing traffic accidents, and preserving law enforcement resources through automated traffic infraction oversight. Statutes and municipal enactments are conferred an exceedingly strong presumption of constitutionality. To overcome the presumption, a plaintiff must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the contested law has no rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. It is further presumed that the legislative body investigated and found a need for the law, and, if any facts justify the law, a court's power of inquiry ends. The record, which included relevant legislative history, showed that disregarding traffic control devices is the leading cause of urban traffic accidents and detailed the toll that motor vehicle crashes exact upon society. It also showed that a system of photographic evidence reduces the cost of law enforcement and increases the proportion of traffic offenses that are detected. Finally, the presence of these findings in the legislative history demonstrated that the state legislature and city council took adequate investigative measures to support their actions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Traffic Infractions -- Red Light Camera Program -- Adjudication of Infraction was Civil in Nature</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant City of Rochester's process for the adjudication of infractions detected through its red light camera program, which automatically monitored compliance with certain traffic control devices throughout the city and imposed liability on the owner of the vehicle if the operator was using it with the owner's express or implied permission, was entirely civil in nature. The statutory scheme demonstrated an unequivocal intent to create a civil enforcement mechanism, not a criminal one. Accordingly, the heightened procedural due process standards applicable to criminal matters did not apply to adjudicative processes under the program. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1111-b, which authorized defendant to implement the program, expressly states that a finding of liability shall not be deemed a conviction. The infraction is adjudicated in an administrative forum, and the maximum penalty is a $50 fine. No jail time or surcharges can be imposed. Whether a particular procedure or punishment is criminal or civil is primarily a matter of statutory construction and only the clearest proof will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Traffic Infractions -- Red Light Camera Program -- Procedural Due Process Standards Met</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant City of Rochester's red light camera program, which automatically monitored compliance with certain traffic control devices throughout the city and imposed liability on the owner of the vehicle if the operator was using it with the owner's express or implied permission (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1111-b), satisfied the requirements of due process applicable to it as a civil enforcement mechanism adjudicated in an administrative forum. First, the program was a minimal invasion into privacy. Photographs of the driver, passengers or contents of a vehicle were prohibited and the $ 50 maximum penalty for a violation was not so substantial as to infringe upon private property rights. In any event, actions undertaken on a public street are not cloaked in constitutional privacy rights. Second, the risk of the erroneous deprivation of a private interest was nominal, as sufficient safeguards were in place. Under the program, an owner charged with a violation received a detailed notice of liability, an opportunity to view the video of the alleged infraction and an opportunity to be heard at a hearing at which he or she could contest the charge. At the hearing, the owner was allowed the assistance of an attorney and to subpoena witnesses and records, and was not restrained by the rules of evidence. The owner's guilt must have been shown by substantial evidence, the defense that the camera was malfunctioning was available and an avenue for appeal existed. Further, an owner could seek indemnification from the operator who committed the alleged infraction. Finally, the government interests in securing public safety and maintaining efficient means of addressing traffic infractions were strong, and the fiscal and administrative burdens of requiring additional procedures, such as requiring live witnesses to authenticate the camera evidence, would have undermined those goals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Traffic Infractions -- Red Light Camera Program -- Owner's Vicarious Liability for Operator's Infraction -- Substantive Due Process Standards Met</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The vicarious liability provision of defendant City of Rochester's red light camera program, which automatically monitored compliance with certain traffic control devices throughout the city, imposed liability on the owner of the vehicle if the operator was using it with the owner's express or implied permission and presumed that such permission had been given (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1111-b), did not deny substantive due process to vehicle owners. The provision was a sound exercise of the government's discretion in managing public safety. There is no fundamental right to run a red light or to avoid being seen by a camera on a public street, and the $50 maximum fine was too modest to qualify as a fundamental property right. Further, similar permissible presumptions appear elsewhere in the Vehicle and Traffic Law, and in the criminal context where more stringent due process protections exist. Finally, the alternative enforcement mechanism, a traffic stop, is much more invasive than the program. It often involves investigatory questioning from a police officer and affords the officer a view into the vehicle. The extension of the doctrine of liability without fault to new situations to attain a permissible legislative object is not so novel in the law or shocking to reason or conscience as to afford in itself any ground for the contention that it denies due process of law. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A regulation adopted by respondent New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and its Commissioner establishing outdoor no-smoking areas in certain parks, historic sites and recreational facilities and banning outdoor smoking in New York City parks (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">9 NYCRR 386.1) was invalid as violative of the separation of powers doctrine. That doctrine requires that the legislature make critical policy decisions and that the executive branch implement those polices. Thus, when the executive branch acts inconsistently with the legislature or usurps its prerogatives, the doctrine is violated. Factors to be considered in determining whether a violation has occurred include whether the regulation is based solely upon economic and social concerns; whether the regulation created a comprehensive set of rules in the absence of legislative guidance; whether the agency was acting in an area in which the legislature has repeatedly tried, but failed, to reach agreement; and whether the regulation involved issues which required no special expertise in the agency's field. Here, the imposition of smoking restrictions was an area fraught with difficult social problems and thus especially suited for legislative guidance yet no legislatively established outdoor tobacco use policy existed; the Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Law did not empower respondents to promulgate rules regulating conduct bearing any tenuous relationship to park patrons' health or welfare; both the Senate and Assembly had attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to target smoking in public parks; and no special expertise was required to understand that secondhand tobacco smoke is deleterious to the health of nonsmokers. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-In a landlord's summary holdover proceeding, alleging that a rent-controlled tenant had sublet the rental premises without permission, the tenant established excusable default pursuant to CPLR 5015(a)(1) because his failure to appear was due to his incarceration, which was not deemed willful due to his many attempts to respond to the proceeding and the failures of various notices; [2]-The tenant made a showing of meritorious defenses because another occupant of the premises was a roommate and not a subletter, it was unconstitutional to extinguish his tenancy rights due to his incarceration under N.Y. Const. art. II, &sect; 4, and there were multiple procedural defects in the pleadings; [3]-Laches did not bar the tenant's day in court, as his default was not willful and the delay in seeking to vacate the default was beyond his control.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Upon entry of a default judgment of possession in favor of petitioner landlord following an inquest conducted in a summary holdover proceeding brought by petitioner against respondent tenant, who was incarcerated at the time the proceeding was commenced, based on allegations that respondent sublet his rent-controlled apartment without petitioner's permission, respondent demonstrated in support of his application to vacate the default judgment under CPLR 5015 (a) (1) that his incarceration constituted a reasonable excuse for his failure to appear at the inquest. Respondent made many and varied attempts to respond to the proceeding, thereby establishing that his failure to appear was not willful; he attempted to retain counsel to represent him in the proceeding; he repeatedly made inquiries at the prison about being produced for the inquest; he sent his common-law wife to court to speak on his behalf; and he sent letters to the court after the inquest explaining why he failed to appear. Moreover, the orders to produce issued by the inquest court, which failed to result in respondent's production at the inquest, did not comply with the statutory requirement that they be signed by a Supreme Court Justice, and the orders used an outdated form requesting respondent's physical production at the inquest rather than his production via videoconference.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Upon entry of a default judgment of possession in favor of petitioner landlord following an inquest conducted in a summary holdover proceeding brought by petitioner against respondent tenant, who was incarcerated at the time the proceeding was commenced, based on allegations that respondent sublet his rent-controlled apartment without petitioner's permission, respondent was denied due process as a result of the inquest court's failure to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent him throughout the proceeding. Trial courts must insure that incarcerated litigants have a meaningful opportunity to be heard, and a litigant who fails to appear in a summary proceeding due to incarceration and whom the court is unable to produce via videoconference or otherwise is unable to adequately defend his or her rights. Here, despite his many and varied attempts to respond to the proceeding, respondent was unable to appear at the inquest due to his incarceration, and the orders to produce issued by the inquest court failed to result in respondent's production at the inquest. Nevertheless, there was nothing in the record to indicate that the inquest court even considered the possibility of appointing a guardian ad litem to represent respondent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Default Judgment -- Vacatur -- Meritorious Defense </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Upon entry of a default judgment of possession in favor of petitioner landlord following an inquest conducted in a summary holdover proceeding brought by petitioner against respondent tenant, who was incarcerated at the time the proceeding was commenced, based on allegations that respondent sublet his rent-controlled apartment without petitioner's permission, respondent sufficiently articulated the existence of meritorious defenses to the proceeding in support of his application to vacate the default judgment under CPLR 5015 (a) (1). Respondent asserted that he had a roommate, not subletting, arrangement with an individual who resided in the apartment both before and after his incarceration but who vacated the apartment prior to the inquest, and he further asserted that, at the time of the inquest, the only alleged occupants of the apartment were his minor child and the child's mother, who could not be considered subtenants given their familial relationship with respondent. Moreover, absence from a rent regulated apartment due to incarceration is excusable and does not preclude the assertion of the tenant's rights. Finally, the pleadings on their face contained numerous defects, including defects in the petition as well as the predicate notices, which were acknowledged by petitioner.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Equity -- Laches -- Delay in Seeking Vacatur of Default Judgment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Upon entry of a default judgment of possession in favor of petitioner landlord following an inquest conducted in a summary holdover proceeding brought by petitioner against respondent tenant, who was incarcerated at the time the proceeding was commenced, based on allegations that respondent sublet his rent-controlled apartment without petitioner's permission, laches did not bar vacatur of the default judgment. Respondent's failure to appear at the inquest was not willful; respondent's three-year delay in seeking vacatur of the default judgment was beyond his control; and the prejudice to petitioner, which spent funds renovating the apartment following entry of the default judgment, was outweighed by the potential prejudice to respondent, who was in danger of losing the rent-controlled apartment that he had occupied for approximately 50 years. Mere delay, however long, is in and of itself insufficient to establish laches. </SPAN></P>

IV and N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Upon discovery that petitioner had overcharged passengers using the higher out of town rate for trips that were entirely within the city according to records generated by a Taxi Technology System, which included a Global Positioning System, that was installed in every city taxicab pursuant to the rules and regulations of respondent New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to electronically transmit location, trip and fare information to the TLC, the revocation of petitioner's taxicab driver's license by respondent TLC Chairperson was a discretionary revocation that petitioner was required, but failed, to appeal to the full TLC. Petitioner thus failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, thereby precluding judicial review of his nonconstitutional claims. TLC Rules (35 RCNY) &sect; 68-18 provides for an appeal to the full TLC from the Chairperson's final decision revoking a taxicab driver's license where the revocation is discretionary. Under TLC Rules (35 RCNY) &sect;&sect; 2-87 (a) (1) and 8-03 (b) (ii), the TLC may exercise its discretion to revoke a taxicab driver's license if the driver is found guilty of overcharging passengers once or twice within 24 months but the TLC must revoke the license if the driver is found guilty of overcharging passengers three times within a 36-month period. Here, the revocation of petitioner's license was identified as a discretionary revocation from the initiation of the charges against him, and the charges against petitioner were for his first offense.  </SPAN></P>

Upon the revocation of petitioner's taxicab driver's license based on discovery that petitioner had overcharged passengers using the higher out of town rate for trips that were entirely within the city according to records generated from a Taxi Technology System (TTS), which included a Global Positioning System, that was installed in every city taxicab pursuant to the rules and regulations of respondent New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to electronically transmit location, trip and fare information to the TLC, there was no violation of petitioner's privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution or article I, &sect; 12 of the New York Constitution. Petitioner did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the data generated by the TTS as he knew that the TTS was installed in his taxicab, he was required to use the TTS pursuant to the TLC rules and regulations and the data collected by the TTS related solely to his employment as a taxicab driver. In any event, any search resulting from the TLC's use of the TTS data was reasonable. Petitioner's privacy interest and the degree of governmental intrusion, which were minimal as the TTS only gathered information when petitioner was on duty and pertaining to the taxicab industry, were outweighed by the substantial governmental interests in insuring the safety of taxicab drivers and passengers and in generating information to improve taxicab customer service.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. An information charging loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense, alleging that defendant approached a police officer and said, &quot;I want sex. I'll give you 40 dollars,&quot; was facially insufficient because only one single instance of the conduct complained of is alleged to have occurred. A person is guilty of loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense under Penal Law &sect; 240.37 (2) when he or she &quot;remains or wanders about in a public place and repeatedly beckons to, or repeatedly stops, or repeatedly attempts to stop, or repeatedly attempts to engage passers-by in conversation, or repeatedly stops or attempts to stop motor vehicles, or repeatedly interferes with the free passage of other persons, for the purpose of prostitution, or of patronizing a prostitute.&quot; The conduct sought to be proscribed is repeated conduct, not a single act.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Speedy Trial -- Effect of Superceding Accusatory Instrument</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant's criminal action was not dismissed on speedy trial grounds, even though the offense initially charged, loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense, a violation, was facially insufficient and a superceding information charging that offense and patronizing a prostitute in the third degree, a class A misdemeanor, was filed eight months after the first accusatory instrument. Replacement of one accusatory instrument that is defective with another involving the same crime does not affect time computations or automatically render the entire period prior thereto includable, and the People's initial statement of readiness was not rendered illusory simply because the initial charge was facially insufficient on both accusatory instruments. Further, any perceived pleading defect related to the subsequently dismissed charge did not serve to vitiate the People's otherwise valid readiness statement relating to the properly pleaded charge. CPL 30.30 time periods are generally calculated based on the most serious offense charged in the accusatory instrument and are measured from the date of commencement of the action. The determinative factor is not the initial charge, but the level of crime with which the defendant is ultimately accused and for which he or she is prosecuted. Because a class A misdemeanor was ultimately charged, a 90-day time period applied. The entire period between commencement of the action and the filing of the superceding information was excludable for various reasons and the People were chargeable with only six days after filing the superceding information, after which they timely announced readiness. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ISSUE: Whether a landlord unlawfully removed apartment units from rent stabilization or control and charged tenants excessive rents under the New York City Rent Control Law and Rent Stabilization Law. HOLDINGS: [1]-Because a forfeiture of rent increases statutory provision was not a penalty it did not bar class certification under CPLR 901(b); [2]-Certification of a class of past and current tenants was appropriate under CPLR 902 and 903; [3]-Dismissal of the landlord's alternative third-party actions against the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) was appropriate because there was no genuine dispute between the DHCR and the landlord, and the DHCR's inclusion in one action as a third party defendant would not affect the determination of the rights and obligations between the landlord and the tenant class, while the other action was not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Class Actions -- Recovery of Penalty -- Claim for Rent Overcharge -- Waiver of Treble Damages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In consolidated class actions in which plaintiffs, former and current tenants of defendant's building complex, sought rent overcharges based on defendant's unlawful deregulation of their apartments under the luxury decontrol provisions of the New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Law and the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 while receiving J-51 tax benefits, plaintiffs' waiver of treble damages under those statutes and their implementing regulations (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect;&sect; 26-413 [d] [2]; 26-516 [a]; 9 NYCRR 2206.8 [b] [1]; 2526.1 [a]) and allowance for class members to opt out of the class to pursue such damages permitted plaintiffs to proceed as a class action despite CPLR 901 (b)'s prohibition against a class action that seeks a statutory penalty. Waiver of a statutory penalty is permitted as long as the penalty is neither mandatory nor the sole measure of recovery, and class members retain the right to opt out of the class to pursue the punitive relief. Here, although the rent-stabilization and rent-control laws provide for treble damages as a penalty for a willful rent overcharge, they supplement the recovery of overcharges and may be awarded only upon a finding of willfulness or bad faith. Thus, treble damages were neither the sole means of recovery nor mandatory and could be waived on behalf of the class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Class Actions -- Recovery of Penalty -- Claim for Rent Overcharge -- Forfeiture of Lawful Rent Increases</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In consolidated class actions in which plaintiffs, former and current tenants of defendant's building complex, sought rent overcharges based on defendant's unlawful deregulation of their apartments under the luxury decontrol provisions of the New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Law and the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 while receiving J-51 tax benefits, plaintiffs' claim that, in calculating their damages, defendant should be deemed to have forfeited lawful rent increases as a result of its noncompliance with rent-stabilization and rent-control registration requirements (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 26-517 [e]; 9 NYCRR 2203.7, 2528.4 [a]) did not bar plaintiffs from proceeding as a class under CPLR 901 (b) as such forfeiture, even if applicable, did not amount to a statutory penalty. The forfeiture of rent increases equates to nonentitlement to a statutory benefit, and the forfeiture provisions do not provide for the recovery of a penalty as redress for noncompliance. Moreover, unlike the treble damages recovery available as a penalty for willful rent overcharges, the forfeiture of lawful rent increases would enhance an overcharge award by comparatively little and thus would not amount to a punitive measure or provide litigation incentive or deterrent effect. In any event, class certification was not to be denied at such an early stage of the litigation solely on the possibility that forfeiture was both a penalty in this context and applicable to a landlord that, like defendant, assumed it was exempted from the registration requirements in reliance on the Division of Housing and Community Renewal's long-standing but erroneous interpretation of the luxury decontrol provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-- Class Actions -- Class Certification</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In consolidated class actions in which plaintiffs, former and current tenants of defendant's building complex, sought rent overcharges based on defendant's unlawful deregulation of their apartments under the luxury decontrol provisions of the New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Law and the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 while receiving J-51 tax benefits, the CPLR 901 (a) prerequisites for class certification were satisfied, and the factors enumerated in CPLR 902 weighed in favor of proceeding as a class action. The proposed class--all tenants formerly and currently residing in defendant's 558 deregulated apartments--was so numerous that it would be impracticable to join the potential plaintiffs individually. Moreover, the common, predominate questions were whether class members paid deregulated rent during defendant's participation in the J-51 program and, if so, the period of defendant's liability and the formula for calculating rent overcharges--questions requiring minimal individualized disputed evidence and to which no conceivable individualized defenses pertained. The named plaintiffs' claims were typical of the classwide claims as they sought the same declaratory and injunctive relief based on defendant's illegal deregulation of their apartments and damages equal to the excessive rents charged as a result thereof according to the same formula, and the named plaintiffs were adequate representatives of the class as the proposed class definition included both former and current tenants whose apartments were deregulated through various means. Finally, the class members' numerosity and the expense of bringing separate, individual actions outweighed any anticipated difficulties in managing a class action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Justiciable Questions -- Third-Party Action for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief -- Lack of Controversy between Parties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Upon the commencement by plaintiffs, former and current tenants of defendant's building complex, of consolidated class actions seeking rent overcharges based on defendant's unlawful deregulation of their apartments under the luxury decontrol provisions of the New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Law and the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 while receiving J-51 tax benefits, third-party actions commenced by defendant against the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) were dismissed in the absence of a viable controversy between the parties. The claims upon which defendant sought declaratory and injunctive relief against DHCR--that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Roberts v Tishman Speyer Props., L.P.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (13 NY3d 270, 918 NE2d 900, 890 NYS2d 388 [2009]), holding that luxury decontrol did not apply to buildings receiving J-51 tax benefits, should not be applied retroactively; that retroactive application of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Roberts</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> constituted an un-constitutional regulatory taking; and that defendant could rescind its participation in the J-51 program--had already been decided, and defendant's alternative claim for declaratory relief--that, upon the expiration of its J-51 tax benefits, it should no longer be subject to rent stabilization or control--was premature for judicial adjudication because the effect of any such declaration would be contingent upon future events that might not occur. Defendant's remaining claims regarding the regulatory status of its apartments and its liability for deregulation while receiving J-51 tax benefits were disputed is sues in which only defendant and the plaintiff class held a genuine stake. The third-party actions thus presented no factual or legal basis to grant defendant any of the relief sought against DHCR.</SPAN></P>
