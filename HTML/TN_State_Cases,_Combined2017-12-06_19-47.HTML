<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of human services (DHS) challenged an order of the Chancery Court for Bradley County holding that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-501 and the pre-January 1, 2005, version of &sect; 36-5-103(f) were unconstitutional in appellee child support child support obligors' action challenging the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-5-103(f) and 36-5-501 on the basis that they violated due process and the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were each paying child support to their respective former spouses, and under &sect;&sect; 36-5-103(f) and 36-5-501, DHS summarily increased the amount of appellees' child support obligations. Appellees maintained that DHS's ability to summarily issue wage assignments without a hearing violated due process and the separation of powers doctrine. The trial court issued an order restraining DHS from acting on any administrative orders and from collecting any child support payments in excess of the amount appellees had previously been ordered to pay. However prior to the trial court declaring Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-103(f)&nbsp;unconstitutional, substantial changes to &sect; 36-5-103(f) became effective. As amended, the statute provided for notice and a hearing prior to the issuance of an order increasing or decreasing a child support obligation under &sect; 36-5-103(f)(4) and (f)(5). Therefore, the only relief available to appellees would be a declaration that &sect; 36-5-103(f) as it existed prior to January 1, 2005 was unconstitutional. And such an order would serve no useful purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was vacated, and the cause was remanded to the trial court with directions to enter an order dismissing this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Lauderdale County (Tennessee), which granted the motion to dismiss filed by defendants, prison officials and Tennessee Department of Corrections (TDOC) personnel, and denied the inmate leave to amend his complaint. The inmate filed his action pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging that prison officials terminated his prison job in retaliation for his filing grievances against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court first held that the inmate's complaint failed to state a claim for violations of the First or Fourteenth Amendments and that the trial court therefore properly dismissed those aspects of his complaint. The court decided that the trial court correctly dismissed the complaint as to a deputy warden and the TDOC's assistant commissioner of operations because the inmate nowhere alleged that they directly participated in the job termination decisions of their subordinates. The court then agreed with the trial court's decision to reject the inmate's amended complaints. The court's independent review of the amended complaints showed that they either suffered from the same deficiencies as the original complaint or constituted actions for which he initially had to seek administrative redress. The court then found that the inmate's alleged need for a preliminary injunction had been abrogated since the inmate's complaint failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. Finally, the court held that the inmate's action should have been dismissed at the trial level pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 41-21-801 et seq., which governed lawsuits filed by inmates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and remanded the case to the trial court for the assessment of all costs, expenses, and fees associated with the lawsuit against the inmate in accordance with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 41-21-801 et seq. Thereafter, the trial court was directed to enter an order assessing that amount to the inmate for filing a frivolous lawsuit and appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant voter filed suit against appellee Shelby County, Tennessee, Election Commission (the Commission), under the Tennessee Declaratory Judgment Act asserting that the legislation authorizing the use of electronic voting machines in some jurisdictions violated Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and Tenn. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The Shelby County Chancery Court, Tennessee, dismissed the complaint pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6). The voter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter sought to have the trial court declare that the Commission must use a system of voter verified, tangible paper ballots that were capable of being placed by the voters into an appropriate ballot box for later tabulation. The voter's primary concern was that, without a paper ballot or paper record of his vote, there could be no meaningful recount in a questionable election outcome, nor could there be a meaningful election contest if one became necessary, and that consequently, his voting rights were diminished when compared with other citizens of Tennessee who received a paper ballot of record. The appellate court ruled that even if it were to concede that paperless voting could disenfranchise voters under certain circumstances, there was no indication in the complaint that voters were presently being disenfranchised by the current voting system. In short, the voter's allegations appeared to be based on conjecture and not upon actual events. The voter presented a theoretical question of what could happen in future elections, which did not rise to the level of a justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Juvenile Court for Knox County, Tennessee, terminated the parental rights of appellant father to his minor child upon finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the father abandoned his child and that termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interest. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(f)(3) was unconstitutional in that it gave trial courts the discretion to determine whether a prisoner was entitled to be physically present in the courtroom during a proceeding involving the termination of the prisoner's parental rights. The appellate court noted that the father failed to give proper notice to the attorney general that he planned to challenge the constitutionality of a state statute. Thus, the appellate court could not address the constitutional issue on appeal. The father had meaningful access to court by way of his participation in the trial via telephone and there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision to proceed with the trial. Appellee relatives alleged an applicable ground of abandonment and the parties proceeded to try the case with the implicit understanding that the relatives were attempting to prove that the father had abandoned the child in the four months preceding his incarceration. The evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that the father's visitation and support of the child did not even rise to the level of token visitation or support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee manufacturer contracted with appellant sales representative company in 1980. In 1994 they entered a new contract. Modifications were made in 2001. In 2002 the manufacturer terminated the contract. The company filed suit. The Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) dismissed the company's action upon determining the contract was governed by former Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-25-1301 et seq., as it existed in 1991. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company prayed for damages of $ 5,000,000, costs, and attorney's fees under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-25-1311(a).&nbsp;The trial court found that the 1991 version of the statute did not provide redress for the damages allegedly suffered by the company. The issue on appeal was whether Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-25-1301 et seq., as amended in 1999, applied to the contract originally executed by the parties in 1994. The appellate court disagreed with the trial court that the additional modifications of sales quota in the contract in 2001 were not material. The 2001 modification established a probationary period and the curative policy modified the termination provisions of the 1994 agreement. The 2001 modification altered the termination rights provision of the contract and significantly and materially affected the parties' rights under the contract. In light of the parties' rights and obligations under the contract, and in light of the intervening amendments to &sect; 47-25-1301 et seq., in 1999, which, inter alia, prohibited termination without cause, the instant modification of termination rights was material. That modification was sufficiently material to have resulted in a new contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court issued a temporary restraining order and, following a hearing, vacated the department's orders with regard to the father's child support and enjoined the mother from further attempts to collect child support without first seeking relief from the court. The court also dismissed the department on the ground that it was not a proper party, and then denied the motion of the attorney general to intervene to defend the constitutionality of the department's administrative child support enforcement procedures. The department and the attorney general appealed.&nbsp;The substantive dispute in the instant case involved the payment of child support. The mother claimed that the father had not paid any of the child support ordered by the court, while the father asserted that he had provided support of the parties' child in excess of the amount the mother claimed was past due. While the instant appeal was pending, the father and the mother compromised and settled their child support dispute. Thus, the courts could no longer grant any sort of meaningful relief to the mother. Therefore, the substantive issue regarding the father's obligation to pay back child support was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was vacated. The case was remanded to the trial court with directions to dismiss the father's petition challenging the constitutionality of a statute. The costs were taxed in equal proportions to the father and the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Washington County, Tennessee, denied plaintiff client's motion to recuse in her legal malpractice action against defendants, her former attorneys.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client argued that the trial court judge abused his discretion in refusing to recuse himself on the basis of his presiding over the underlying wrongful death action. The appellate court found that the judge's involvement in the underlying litigation would not disqualify him from hearing the legal malpractice action. His dismissal of the wrongful death action did not address, expressly or by implication, whether the dismissal was proximately caused by or even remotely associated with any act of legal malpractice on the part of the attorneys in the instant case. The wrongful death suit was, in the judge's opinion, time-barred without regard to whether the client's lawyers in that case had pursued their representation in keeping with the applicable standard of care or not. No reasonable person could question the judge's impartiality in hearing the instant litigation simply because he ruled, as a matter of law, that the underlying suit was filed outside the period of the applicable statute of limitations. There was no conceivable subject that would require the judge to trade his seat on the bench for a seat on the witness stand. The attorneys' issues were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged a judgment of the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) that granted summary judgment in favor of appellee revenue commissioner in the taxpayer's action seeking a refund of a percentage of franchise and excise taxes paid in fiscal year 1999-2000 pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 56-4-217(b) (Supp. 2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that because the premium tax credits allowed under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 56-4-217(a) applied to workers' compensation self-insurers, the franchise and excise tax credits allowed under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 56-4-217(b) applied to self insurers as well. The court held that although a tax credit was allowed under &sect; 56-4-217(a) for premium taxes paid by self-insurers, the tax credit for franchise taxes under &sect; 56-4-217(b) did not apply to self insurers because &sect; 56-4-217(b) was added to the statute at the same time and in conjunction with &sect; 56-4-217(c), which restricted its application to insurance companies as defined in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 56-1-102(2); thus the credit described in &sect; 56-4-217(b) was also restricted to insurance companies and did not apply to the taxpayer as a self-insurer. The court rejected the taxpayer's equal protection claims because the classification of insurance companies versus self-insurers rested rest upon a reasonable basis. The court held that alleviating the effects of retaliatory taxation by other states to the disadvantage of Tennessee's domestic insurance companies standing alone was a sufficient basis to withstand equal protection scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Knox County, Tennessee, held that the language of a divorce decree mandated that appellee wife was entitled, without limitation, to one-half of appellant husband's retirement benefits. The trial court found that the husband's retirement, when it happened, would constitute a change in circumstances. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband argued that the wife's entitlement with respect to the retirement benefits should be limited to a share of the benefits that accrued before the divorce. The appellate court agreed with the trial court's interpretation of the divorce decree because, simply stated, the wife was entitled, without limitation, to half of the husband's retirement. The issue before the appellate court was the intention of the court as gathered from all of the judgment. The issue was not what the court should have intended. The addition of the limiting language sought by the husband would change the meaning of the judgment as it pertained to the annuity plan. The doctrine of res judicata precluded the appellate court from going behind the final judgment to test whether the trial court erred, factually or legally, in awarding the wife, without limitation, one-half of the husband's retirement benefits. The husband had ample options available to him at a much earlier time to correct any errors. The trial court could not examine the totality of the circumstances surrounding the husband's retirement to ensure that it was objectively reasonable as he had not retired or set a date for retirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed except the judgment regarding whether the husband's retirement constituted a change in circumstances was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Knox County (Tennessee), which granted summary judgment to appellees, a judicial commissioner, a county, and a surety, in an action seeking relief from a failure to issue a Tenn. R. Crim. P. 4(a) criminal summons. The complaint sought mandamus relief, a declaratory judgment, and alleged a failure/neglect to perform duties and malicious harassment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner contended that several law enforcement officers trespassed on his property and assaulted him. He went to the judicial commissioner in an attempt to obtain a criminal summons. The judicial commissioner refused to issue such, citing Knox County, Tenn., Gen. Sess. Ct. R. 20 and Knox County, Tenn., Gen. Sess. Ct. R. 25. Summary judgment was granted, and the owner sought review. On appeal, the reviewing court determined that, based on the clear language of Tenn. R. Crim. P. 4(a), a police report was not a prerequisite to the issuance of a criminal summons. Due to the conflict with Rule 4(a), Knox County, Tenn., Gen. Sess. Ct. R. 20 was invalid. Next, the appellate court held that there was no cause of action under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-21-701 because the owner was unable to show that the actions were based on discrimination. The Tennessee Court of the Judiciary was vested with the authority to hear the claims relating to the neglect of duty under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-5-101. Finally, the judicial commissioner was immune from liability under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-38-102, and there was no authority for the recovery of damages under Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the determination relating to the validity of a local rule. The rest of the decision was affirmed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee lienholder filed suit against appellant county seeking damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 alleging the county failed to provide adequate notice to it of the delinquent taxes and scheduled tax sale in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-5-2502 and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) held that due process required certified mail. The County appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county did not dispute that the lienholder's interest was a protected property interest that could not be disturbed absent due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. The issue was whether the county was required by due process to notify lienholders by certified mail, as opposed to regular mail, that it was preparing to sell the secured property to collect delinquent taxes. The appellate court held that even though certified mail might have been &quot;better&quot; notice and the county might elect to use that notice in the future, constitutional due process did not require the adoption of other, more expensive delivery methods, and the county's practice of sending notice to lien holders of a tax sale by regular mail did not violate due process. The U.S. Supreme Court in Mennonite found regular mail was a sufficient means to provide lienholders notice of a tax sale. The fact that the lienholder did not receive the notice in the instant case did not nullify the efficacy of the use of regular mail. The Supreme Court in Mullane recognized that in order to meet minimum due process, the method of notice did not have to be fail proof since constitutional law had to take some chances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. Costs were assessed against the lienholder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Sevier County (Tennessee) held that a child support judgment entered by a Canadian court was entitled to registration, but was not entitled to enforcement in Tennessee pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-2001 et seq. The circuit court ordered appellee father to pay significantly less than the amount previously ordered by the Canadian court. Appellant State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment entered by the Canadian court set the father's child support obligation based on an annual income of $ 250,000. The Canadian court stated that had he properly disclosed his income in 1997, the table amount under the guidelines on income of $ 250,000 was $ 2,801 per month. In accordance with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-2611, the circuit court was without subject matter jurisdiction to modify the Canadian child support judgment. The father claimed that the circuit court really did not modify the Canadian judgment, but rather enforced that judgment only to the extent that the father actually could pay the support, i.e., $ 500 or $ 600 per month. The appellate court was at a loss as to how the circuit court's holding that the father should pay only $ 500 to $ 600 per month in child support could be deemed anything other than a direct modification of the Canadian judgment, which both parties and the circuit court agreed the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to do. The appellate court also held that the father failed to prove the existence of any defense to the registration or the enforcement of the child support order issued by the Canadian court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was affirmed insofar as it registered the judgment of the Canadian court. The judgment which concluded that the Canadian judgment was not entitled to enforcement and that the father should be ordered to pay only $ 500 to $ 600 per month was reversed. On remand, inter alia, the court was to enforce the judgment of the Canadian court and determine the amount of arrearages since the entry of the Canadian judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that under &sect; 6-58-111(a)(2), the landowners were required to prove that annexation would not materially benefit the welfare of the citizens and property owners of the city and the affected territory. The evidence established the territory would materially benefit from annexation in that the territory would gain better city services. The city would benefit as well given that the territory was an enclave surrounded by the city and there was confusion regarding the extent of city services in the area. It followed that the failure to annex the would materially retard the welfare of the citizens and property owners of the city and territory. The court also held that because &sect; 6-58-111(b) was not an attempt to create a rule that applied only to one or a few chosen local governments, it did not violate Tenn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, upheld a decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ) for appellee, the Tennessee Department of Safety, which concluded that vehicles and cash allegedly owned by appellant, a father, were subject to forfeiture pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 53-11-451(a)(6)(A) (2005). The father, whose son had attempted to purchase a quantity of cocaine, sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed the father agreed to help his son, who had a record of drug offenses, start his own car business. While the father provided some start up money, the small dealership (in the father's name) was run by said son on a day to day basis. While the son was operating the dealership, an undercover informant arranged to sell him a large quantity of cocaine. The ALJ determined the father failed to demonstrate any legal interest in the cash or any ownership of the 33 vehicles that were seized (pursuant to forfeiture warrants from the Circuit Court for Wilson County). The appellate court rejected the father's argument that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-33-204 (2003), which permitted any state judge to issue a forfeiture warrant even when the property was not located within the judge's jurisdiction, violated Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The father presented no authority for the notion that a court of record could not constitutionally issue a warrant for the forfeiture of property that was not located in its judicial district. In addition, he presented no evidence that he experienced any difficulty in obtaining the information required to be kept by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-33-204(b) (2003).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company had no written policies for its trust administration department and the sole shareholder had virtually no oversight. When it was determined that the company had a deficit fiduciary cash position of over $ 7 million, and the company failed to prepare a capital plan as ordered, the Commissioner took emergency possession. The court held that &sect; 45-2-1502 did not violate the separation of powers provision of Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 2, because the Commissioner's powers were limited to the judicial powers reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of the purposes of the Department. Also, it was clear that the Tennessee Banking Act applied to trust companies from the language of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 45-1-124(b) and (d). Given the shareholder's admissions of the deficit, there was ample evidence that the company was being run in an unsound manner and further, material evidence existed to support the decision to take emergency possession. The evidence of an admitted multi-million dollar fiduciary cash deficiency, the company's poor earning performance, operation at a net loss, and no plan to eliminate the deficiencies, provided a sound basis for the liquidation of the company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an elderly resident and her purported attorney-in-fact, challenged a decision of the Probate and Family Court for Cumberland County, Tennessee, which ruled that two powers of attorney were void, and appointed a public guardian to serve as the resident's conservator. The action was brought by appellees, the resident's nieces, alleging that the resident suffered from dementia.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1996, the resident executed a purported durable power of attorney to a lawyer and to the lawyer's wife should the lawyer become incapacitated. She also appointed the lawyer as co-trustee over an inter vivos trust and named the wife as the successor trustee. The probate court held that the 1996 document was not properly executed, and appellants subsequently executed a second power of attorney, which the probate court held was invalid due to the resident's disability. The court held that the probate court erred in admitting a medical report from a court-appointed physician because it was hearsay in that nowhere in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 34-3-105(a) (2003) did the legislature direct that the report be admitted without being tested by the evidentiary rules. However, the other testimony from lay witnesses was sufficient to show the resident's mental incapacity, such as the resident offering her yard person $800 to cut her yard, and her talk of people living in her basement. The court agreed that the two powers of attorney were invalid. Also, the trial court properly appointed a public guardian as conservator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the probate court's evidentiary ruling regarding admission of the medical report, but the error did not require remand. The court otherwise affirmed the orders of the probate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee individuals filed petitions alleging that a city court violated the $ 50 fine clause in Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Tennessee) denied appellant city's motion to quash the petitions and held, inter alia, that the fines were unconstitutional and the prospective application of Chattanooga v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the individuals' use of petitions for writ of certiorari were used impermissibly as a substitute for appeal, that the issues raised by them were barred by the doctrine of res judicata, and that the Tennessee Supreme Court's decision in Davis v. City of Chattanooga, applied prospectively and, thus, did not apply to the instant penalties, and that the city court's collection of the fines in chronological order was against public policy. Inter alia, the appellate court held that the individuals were attempting to render the amount of the fines imposed by the city's ordinances unconstitutional and in violation of art. VI, &sect;&nbsp;14. Thus, the circuit court's grant of the petition for writ of certiorari and its denial of the city's motion to quash the petitions were not an abuse of discretion. The individuals were not trying to re-litigate the issues when they petitioned for writ of certiorari. Rather, they sought relief from a void judgment of an inferior tribunal that exceeded its jurisdiction by rendering fines over $ 50 in violation of art. VI, &sect;&nbsp;14. Thus, the doctrine of res judicata did not bar the petitions for writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part and the case was remanded for further proceedings. Costs of the appeal were taxed equally to the city and to the individuals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the constitutionality of &sect; 67-5-225, which provided that the real and personal property of a nonprofit family wellness center would be exempt from property taxes as a charitable use of property if the center was owned and operated by an I.R.C. &sect; 501c(3) charitable organization. The appellate court affirmed the constitutionality of the statute on its face as the classification for fitness centers contained in the statute was reasonably related to the expressed public policy to provide for the physical health and social well-being of citizens, and the statute did not violate Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 28, as under the statute the property had to be used to further the purposes of a tax exempt organization. Tenn.

The appellate court reversed the trial court's ruling as to whether one of appellee's facilities met the requirements of &sect; 67-5-225, as there was a question as to whether that particular facility provided access to children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowners filed a complaint with the Tennessee Claims Commission against the State of Tennessee for an alleged unconstitutional taking of their property in connection with the State's issuance of a permit to the homeowners to install a subsurface sewage disposal system. The Commission ruled in favor of the State, finding among other things that the homeowners' claim was time barred. The homeowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the homeowners' suit was timely filed. The applicable statute of limitations allowed a landowner one year within which to commence an action for taking of land after the landowner realized or reasonably should have realized that their property had sustained an injury that was permanent. The homeowners contended they did not realize that they had suffered permanent injury until the State eliminated the possibility that the injury to their property could be resolved. The Commission concluded that an Administrative Law Judge's final order reasonably should have put them on notice that any taking of their property by reason of the denial of their permit was permanent. They were therefore required to exercise due diligence to ascertain the pertinent facts within one year of this occurrence and to initiate suit. The proof demonstrated that they did not do so and therefore the Commission concluded the claim should be dismissed as time barred. The evidence did not preponderate against the finding of the Commission that the homeowners did not exercise due diligence to ascertain the pertinent facts within one year of the order of the administrative law judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants parents appealed the judgment of the Chancery Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) that terminated their parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the conclusion of a three month foster care period, the biological parents agreed to the transferring of custody of the child to appellees foster parents. The biological parents continued limited visitation with the child but paid no child support. The biological parents argued, inter alia, that termination was not in the child's best interests. The court of appeals disagreed. The trial court concluded that the child had developed a strong psychological and emotional attachment to the foster parents, and that removal of the child from them would cause substantial harm to the child. The foster parents provided a stable, loving environment for such a length of time that removal of the child would cause substantial harm. The continuation of a parent-child relationship between the child and the biological parents would diminish the child's chances of early integration into a permanent home. The trial court also concluded that there was misconduct, that the biological parents were unfit, and that they were of questionable character as evidenced by their defiance to legal authority and untruthful statements over the course of events giving rise to the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that the parents willfully failed to support the child for four months immediately preceding the petition to terminate parental rights was reversed. The judgment was reversed as to the trial court's finding that at the time the petition was filed, the father was not the legal parent or guardian of the child. The court erred in finding that Tenn. Code Ann. 36-1-113(g)(3)(A) did not apply. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, elected members of the county board of commissioners, challenged a decision of the Chancery Court for Shelby County, Tennessee, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, the county and the county election commission, in appellants' action seeking a declaration that term limits on their board seats under Shelby County, Tenn., Charter art. II, &sect; 2.03(G) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were candidates for the board, and under Shelby County, Tenn., Charter art. II, &sect; 2.03(G), they were ineligible to be elected when there current terms expired. The trial court held that &sect; 2.03 (G) was not invalid under Tenn. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1. The court held that the plural &quot;terms&quot; in art. VII did not mandate that each officer should be entitled to be elected to more than one term and that Shelby County, Tenn., Charter art. II, &sect; 2.03(G) did not violate Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-210. The court reversed, though, and held that a plain reading of &sect; 5-1-210(12) compelled the conclusion that county governments must include the constitutional officers prescribed by Tenn. Const. art. VII. Also, nothing in art. VII supported the proposition that the General Assembly's duty to prescribe the qualifications of constitutional officers was not mandatory or that the General Assembly could delegate the authority. Because art. VII, &sect; 1, para. 3 could not be read as a stand-alone provision, members of board were constitutional officers, and the court elided the phrase &quot;qualifications for holding office&quot; from Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-210(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment and awarded summary judgment to appellants. The court enjoined the county from enforcing the charter provision at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother and her husband filed a second petition in the Juvenile Court for Williamson County (Tennessee) to terminate appellant incarcerated biological father's parental rights. The petition was based solely on the ground for termination in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(g)(6) and the claim that terminating the father's parental rights was in the child's best interests. The trial court granted the termination petition. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father asserted that many of the factors in &sect; 36-1-113(i) for determining a child's best interests did not apply to him because he was incarcerated and that the court placed undue weight on his failure to support the child financially. All or virtually all of the statutory factors weighed in favor of terminating the father's parental rights. He lived in a prison, continued to use illegal drugs, and had amassed a record of 14 disciplinary violations while incarcerated. He had not seen the child in well over five years, had made no more than token efforts to establish a relationship with the child during that time, and had paid far less to support his child than he could have even given his meager resources. The fact that he decided to conceive a child at a time when he knew he was facing almost certain conviction for a heinous crime and would therefore most likely be unavailable to support or care for the child for a large portion of the child's early life spoke volumes about his lack of a sustained commitment to the child. By contrast, the husband had demonstrated his commitment to the welfare and long-term well being of the child through years of concrete action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Costs of the appeal were taxed to the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because of appellee's numerous suits regarding the constitutionality of out-of-state contributions to political campaigns, a special master was to review his fillings and determine if they should proceed. The special master determined that the instant case could proceed. The Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) granted a motion to dismiss but denied the imposition of Tenn. R. Civ. P. 11 sanctions. Appellant attorney general appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The &quot;fail-safe&quot; order specified that the special master had to determine whether appellee's new lawsuits were frivolous or duplicative of other lawsuits previously filed by him. The difficulty with faulting the chancellor for refusing to impose sanctions was that it was plain from the special master's report that after reciting both the provision regarding Tenn. Const. art. X, &sect; 3 together with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-19-126 and the provision relative to legally frivolous or duplicative lawsuits, the special master specifically ruled only on the constitutional and statutory provisions without addressing the issue of frivolous or duplicative matters. No party appealed the action of the special master. If the attorney general was dissatisfied with the report of the special master, the remedy was to appeal to the Chancellor or the Presiding Judge of Davidson County State Trial Courts. Having failed to do so, he now sought to hold the chancellor to an abuse of discretion for refusing to impose sanctions regardless of the &quot;fail-safe&quot; mechanism. The Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Nashville was not prepared under those circumstances to hold that the chancellor abused her discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the chancellor was in all respects affirmed with costs assessed to the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a decision by an administrative law judge, an automobile belonging to appellee motorist was forfeited, after notice and hearing, for a violation of the driving under the influence of an intoxicant (DUI) law. However, for undisclosed reasons, an order nolle prosequi was later entered. The motorist sought review, and the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, reversed the forfeiture. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancery court held that a conviction for DUI was a prerequisite to a forfeiture under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403(k). On appeal, the State (the Tennessee Commissioner of the Department of Safety) presented for review the issues of: (1) whether a conviction for DUI was a condition precedent to a forfeiture of the vehicle, and (2) whether an administrative finding that a driver had violated the DUI statute unconstitutionally infringed upon the driver's right to a trial on the DUI offense. Examining the relevant statutory language and legislative history, the appellate court held that a conviction for driving under the influence of an intoxicant (DUI) was not a prerequisite to a forfeiture of a vehicle under &sect; 55-10-403(k). Secondly, the matter involved a civil proceeding, requiring a preponderance of the proof as opposed to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court concluded that the various statutory schemes, and the various statutes, clearly revealed the legislative intent to authorize forfeiture even in cases where the party was found innocent of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture action, an in rem proceeding against the property only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the case was remanded to the administrative agency. Costs were assessed to the motorist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, county and Gibson County Special School District (GCSSD), challenged a judgment of the Chancery Court, Davidson County (Tennessee) that granted summary judgment in part for appellees, city and its officials, holding that the county was obligated to operate a county school system and to levy a countywide property tax for schools, and that 2002 Tenn. Pub. Acts 770 (codified as Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-2-501(b)(2)(C)) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county ceased operating schools because all of its students were served by the GCSSD or other special districts. The city claimed the county had a constitutional and statutory duty to oversee education in the county, operate a school system, and levy a countywide property tax to fund schools, and that its failure to do so resulted in an unequal educational opportunity to county students in violation of Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 12. The trial court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-1-102 placed a duty on the county to operate a school system and that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-2-501(b)(2)(C), which stated that the county was not required to operate a separate county school system, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 49-2-501(b)(2)(C) was constitutional because it was not special legislation and it was rationally related to legitimate legislative interests. The court held that the county was not required to operate a school system or to levy a countywide property tax because the legislature had wide discretion in establishing its education system and it was not shown that the method used to raise revenue for schools had resulted in unequal educational opportunities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged a decision from the Chancery Court for Rutherford County (Tennessee), which dismissed her complaint against appellee father regarding the modification of his child support obligation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was ordered to pay weekly child support. After the father was laid off, he asked the Tennessee Department of Human Services to lower his obligation. The Department granted the request under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-103(f) (repealed January 1, 2005). The mother then filed a complaint, which alleged that the Department had taken away her property right without due process of law. The complaint was dismissed, and the mother sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the former version of &sect; 36-5-103 did not have a requirement of notice of a request for modification to the affected party, notice of a proposed adjustment, or the opportunity to object and be heard before the modification became effective. As such, the court held that this procedure violated the Fourteenth Amendment and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. At the very least, the court found that the agency was not permitted to unilaterally reduce child support without pre-deprivation notice and an opportunity to be heard. The court noted that the amended version of &sect; 36-5-103 ensured pre-deprivation due process. Finally, the court declined to consider the mother's remaining constitutional challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the modification of support order was declared void. The case was remanded to the trial court for a determination of the appropriate amount to compensate the mother for the temporary loss of support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city filed suit in the Criminal Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, seeking to enjoin the operation of a brothel on appellant property owner's land and requiring it to post a $ 20,000 bond to assure compliance with the injunction. The trial court granted the city its requested relief. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's predecessors in interest were the original parties to the abatement proceedings. During the pendency of those proceedings, the property was conveyed to the property owner. The property owner agreed to permit the city to remove all items on the premises that were used for the purpose of maintaining a brothel and to permit the entry of a permanent injunction against operating a brothel on the premises, but the city insisted on a $ 20,000 surety bond to assure compliance with the injunction. The property owner appealed the portion of the trial court's order requiring it to post a bond to assure continued compliance with the abatement order. The appellate court held that contrary to the trial court's belief that the bond requirement did not restrict the property owner's lawful use of its property, the requirement of posting a bond effectively deprived it of all economically beneficial use of its property unless it posted an acceptable $ 20,000 bond and then maintained that bond as long as it owned the property. The appellate court concluded that the trial court's order went well beyond Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-3-110 and amount to an unconstitutional taking of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's abatement order was affirmed, as modified to enter a revised order omitting the bond requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher and union member brought a suit against appellee union alleging, inter alia, that his union dues were being used in violation of his rights to free speech, free assembly and petition, and freedom of religion set out in Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 19, and 23. The Circuit Court for Polk County (Tennessee) dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The teacher appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher also claimed that his due process rights under Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 had been violated and that the state granted the education association a monopoly in violation of Tenn. Const. art I, &sect; 22. The controversy sprung from the Education Professional Negotiations Act (EPNA), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 49-5-601 - 49-5-613 (2002). The Supreme Court of Tennessee believed that the complaint, though premised on state constitutional violations, could also have been construed to have alleged other wrongs upon which relief could have been granted. For instance, the complaint alleged that the teacher paid his dues but protested the use of a portion of his dues. The EPNA contained authority for a collective bargaining organization for the purpose of a relationship of the various employees with the board of education, and it could have been interpreted to mean that a voluntary donation of a portion of the dues collected from the employees exceeded the authority granted. Giving the complaint its liberal construction, the supreme court found that the complaint, as to the first four counts thereof, stated a cause of action upon which relief could have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a metropolitan government and county, challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court, Davidson County (Tennessee), that found two zoning ordinances violated due process and equal protection rights on their face and that appellee landfill developer was not entitled to an injunction or damages and did not have standing to bring a takings claim. The developer challenged the finding that the ordinances did not constitute exclusionary zoning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer claimed the ordinances, which regulated the location of construction and demolition (C &amp; D) landfills, were unconstitutional on their face and exclusionary as they treated C &amp; D landfills differently and precluded the construction of such landfills in the county. On appeal, the court rejected appellants' claim that the landfill developer was precluded from bringing its facial challenges to the ordinances. The court held that the U.S. Supreme Court had not adopted a position that substantive due process claims related to a zoning ordinance were always subsumed into a takings claim and had rejected the view that the applicability of one constitutional amendment preempts the guarantees of another. Also, the Tennessee courts had traditionally analyzed zoning ordinances under the rational basis test as an exercise of the local government's police power. The court rejected appellants' ripeness claims, holding that the ripeness requirements that applied to takings claims did not apply to facial challenges of an ordinance. The court held that the ordinances failed to meet the rational basis test and that the developer was entitled to attorney fees as the prevailing party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment and the award of attorney's fees. The court affirmed the trial court's holding that the developer was not precluded from bringing its facial challenge to the ordinances on substantive due process and equal protection grounds and that the trial court's determination that the ordinances violated those constitutional protections. The court assessed the costs of the appeal to appellants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father appealed the judgment of the Chancery Court for Henry County (Tennessee) that modified his child support and failed to modify his alimony obligation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in refusing to modify the award of alimony provided by the marital dissolution agreement (MDA). The court of appeals disagreed. The award of alimony was not determined by the trial court but was agreed to by the parties as a contractual provision of a very detailed MDA. The alimony provision provided for annual fluctuations in the amount of alimony based on the consumer price index. It also established a minimum alimony payment notwithstanding potential fluctuations and provided for increases in alimony upon the emancipation of the parties' children. When the MDA was executed, the mother was a registered nurse, although she was not working as a nurse and had minimal income. The father argued that his alimony obligation should be reduced to the $ 1,500 minimum amount established by the MDA because he did not anticipate that the mother would return to work as a registered nurse on a full-time basis. However, the trial court properly found that there had been no substantial and material change of circumstance warranting modification of the alimony provision of the parties' MDA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed with regard to the trial court's finding that the mother was entitled to an additional increase of child support upon emancipation of the parties' younger child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, independent candidate, challenged the judgment of the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, dismissing his action which sought to have the election for United States Senate declared void, pursuant to the motion to dismiss, Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The independent candidate sought to have the election declared void on the basis that the incumbent candidate used his own money and accepted campaign contribution in support of his candidacy. The main thrust of the independent candidate's argument was that such contributions, and the necessity therefore, constituted an additional property qualification, available only to those who had money or could raise money and unavailable to candidates lacking such good fortune. The independent candidate asserted that the giving and receiving of campaign contributions added property qualifications to the electoral process which was prohibited. The independent candidate asserted that Tenn. Const. art. IV provided that the only qualifications for those seeking public office were citizenship, age and residency. By the independent candidate's reasoning, the need to raise money constituted an additional qualification in violation of the Tennessee Constitution. The court ruled that the zeal of the independent candidate's crusade could not vest the judiciary with powers that were essentially legislative in character.</SPAN></P>

However, the trial judge in the Circuit Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, sitting without a jury, found that the defendant violated the implied consent law and revoked his license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant was driving while under the influence of an intoxicant. By refusing to take a blood alcohol test, he violated the implied consent law. His license was revoked by the judge under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-406(3). Defendant claimed that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-406(3) was unconstitutional, because it required the judge to also serve as an administrative officer of the Tennessee Department of Safety and rule on the civil charge of the alleged violation of the implied consent law. Defendant's claim lacked merit, because the implied consent law did not violate the separation of powers clause. Conviction under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-406 with the right of the trial judge to prohibit the person from driving was a judicial act, and it had no relation whatever to the Department of Safety's power to grant, revoke and suspend licenses.</SPAN></P>

Defendant renovated the dormitory and, it was decided that the name would be changed. The court held: (1) because plaintiff did not claim that it intended to create a revocable charitable trust when it entered into the agreements with the college, the contracts reflected a charitable gift subject to conditions; (2) the contracts did not specify the duration of the conditions, but the court concluded that the conditions were limited to the life of the building itself; (3) the original placement of the plaque did not constitute substantial performance; (4) defendant's legal obligation to comply with the conditions of the gift agreement arose defendant's own decision to enter into a merger agreement with the college, so defendant's assertions of academic freedom did not apply; (5) because defendant presented no legal basis for permitting it to keep the gift while refusing to honor the conditions attached to it, defendant had to either return the present value of the gift to plaintiff or abide by the conditions originally placed on the gift.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 70-4-403(4)(B), defendant, the State, banned the importation of white-tailed deer based on concerns of the spread of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) to Tennessee's white-tail deer population. Plaintiffs, numerous individuals, asserted the statute violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, upheld the statute. Plaintiffs sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs included persons who imported wildlife or exotic animals for business purposes and for sale to customers. Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), was a fatal, transmissible disease of the central nervous system found in white-tailed deer, mule deer, and Rocky Mountain elk and scientists appeared to have agreed that captivity of elk and deer facilitated the transmission of the disease. However, mule deer and elk could be tested for CWD before they were imported into Tennessee. There was no similar test for white-tailed deer, which could be tested only by an autopsy following their death. The appellate court noted that preventing the spread of CWD to Tennessee's indigenous white-tailed deer was an interest of the highest order and therefore the subject legislation was reasonable. The appellate court held that plaintiffs' assertion that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 70-4-403(4)(B)&nbsp;unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce failed to demonstrate that the statute discriminated against interstate commerce or that its incidental burdens on interstate commerce were clearly excessive in relation to the benefits it provided by protecting the health of Tennessee's indigenous white-tailed deer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a prisoner, filed a petition for common law writ of certiorari, contending that the refusal of appellee, the Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole, to release him violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto enactments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1977, appellant was sentenced to life in prison for a first degree murder. In 2000, three out of seven members of the parole board voted to parole him. Because of a 1997 statute that required four members of the parole board to concur, parole was denied. He did not file his complaint for writ of certiorari until 2003. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 27-9-101, -102 required him to seek review within sixty days of entry of the final order. Therefore, appellant's petition was untimely. As for the merits of appellant's ex post facto claim, the parole board's application of the four vote provision of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-28-105(d)(3) was not constitutional. At the time he committed his crime, the parole board was composed of three members, and a majority vote or 67% was required to grant parole. Requiring a vote of four out of seven members or 57% did not disadvantage his quest for parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners obtained a permit to construct an accessory storage building on his property, which was zoned A-1 (Agricultural-Forestry).

He represented that he intended to place hay, antique cars, and storage in the building, but he used the building for warehousing tractor-trailer loads of doors and other materials for his retail building supply store. The Board of Zoning Appeals found him to be in violation of the Jefferson County, Tenn., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 9.3 and ruled that his use of the building was not allowed in the zoning classification. On certiorari, the trial judge affirmed the Board's decision and enjoined the owners from using the building in violation of the zoning ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the terms &quot;storage shed&quot; and &quot;repair shop&quot; in the ordinance were not vague and overbroad but were common every day terms, and when considered in the context of the ordinance, their meaning and intent were clear.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner sought to have the property zoned from agricultural to commercial in order to allow billboards on the property. Because the circuit court reversed the city's denial and remanded to have the city council again deny the landowner's request, the trial court found that the city violated the court's order but that it was not willful. The court reversed and held that neither party filed a notice of appeal seeking to contest the trial court's amended order and therefore the court could not examine the correctness of the trial court's order on the original petition filed by appellee. The court also held that the trial court failed to identify and apply the correct legal principle to the petition for contempt. Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the actions of the city council did not constitute contempt due to the erroneous advice of its lawyer. On remand, should the trial court determine that the actions of the city council constituted willful contempt of the court's order, the trial court was instructed to fashion an appropriate sanction authorized by law under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-9-103 to -105 (2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded for a determination of whether the actions of the city council constituted contempt of the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Henry County (Tennessee) increased appellant husband's alimony obligation pursuant to the parties' marital dissolution agreement (MDA). It also denied the husband's petition to modify his alimony obligation and increased appellant wife's child support obligation retroactive to June 1, 2003. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, the husband asserted that the trial court had erred in refusing to modify the award of alimony provided by the MDA provision. The alimony provision provided for annual fluctuations in the amount of alimony based on the consumer price index. When the MDA was executed, the wife was a registered nurse, although she was not working as a nurse and had minimal income. The parties disputed whether the wife's return to full-time employment and resultant increase in income constituted a substantial and material change. The husband argued that he did not anticipate that the wife would return to work as a registered nurse on a full-time basis. The wife asserted that she had worked as a registered nurse during the marriage, that there was no evidence that she was unable to work after the divorce, and that it was &quot;incredible&quot; that the husband would not have foreseen that she would return to work as a registered nurse in the future. The appellate court agreed with the trial court, that there had been no substantial and material change of circumstance warranting modification of the alimony provision of the parties' MDA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court increasing the child support obligation was affirmed but the order was modified as was the order increasing the husband's alimony obligation. The trial court's finding that the wife was entitled to an additional increase of alimony upon emancipation of the parties' younger child was reversed and the trial court's judgment on that issue was vacated. The cause was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's effective sentence was 48 years. He was eligible for parole in 2001, and in 2002 the board of parole declined parole owing to a substantial risk that he would not conform to the conditions of his release and ordered no further review for 15 years. The Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) dismissed appellant's petition for certiorari that alleged that the board's action was ex post facto. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed, inter alia, that the board, not only denied him parole, but unconstitutionally ordered no further review for 15 years. The policy of the board was later changed. The appellate court agreed with the State that the Policy Change Notice, which amended Tenn. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. Policy 501.30 by omitting the provision for annual parole hearings, was an administrative change and did not add to appellant's punishment. He was convicted of aggravated kidnapping, especially aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary and extortion for which he received an effective sentence of 48 years. The board declined parole finding that there was a substantial risk that he would not conform to the conditions of his release and that his release from custody would depreciate the seriousness of his crimes. The board set his next parole review for February 2017. The appellate court held that appellant had no constitutional or inherent right to conditional release prior to the expiration of a valid sentence. There was no change in any law which had retroactively inflicted a greater punishment on defendant; therefore, his ex post facto claim was without merit and was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the judgment deferring parole consideration until 2017 was reversed; otherwise the judgment was affirmed. Costs were assessed to appellant.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a complaint, seeking a declaration that it had a vested right to erect a non-conforming replacement sign. The Chancery Court for Williamson County, Tennessee, dismissed the complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three years after its free-standing advertising sign was damaged in a thunderstorm and removed, the restaurant owner decided to erect a replacement sign. The restaurant was notified by the city that it had remove the support posts remaining from the original sign. That notice also stated that the old sign could not be reconstructed since it did not conform to a new sign ordinance. The restaurant owner filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, seeking a declaration that it had a vested right under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-7-208 to erect a non-conforming replacement sign. Although the protections of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-7-208 applied generally to on-site advertising signs, the restaurant owner was not entitled to a declaratory judgment that its sign could be reconstructed without regard to the city's sign ordinance. The restaurant owner should have appealed the Sign Codes Administrator's interpretation or determination to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Its failure to exhaust this administrative remedy justified the trial court's dismissal of the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Madison County, Tennessee, granted judgment in favor of plaintiff utility company on its claim against defendant building owner for past due utility payments by dismissing the owner's appeal from general sessions court on the basis that it was not filed within ten days of the final general sessions judgment entered. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that the ten-day time limitations was tolled by his general sessions petition to rehear and that the ten day period under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-5-108 for filing an appeal from general sessions court began to run the day after it entered its August 6, 2003, denial of his petition to rehear. The appellate court found that the petition to rehear was filed within the ten-day time period for appeal to circuit court, and the denial of the petition was likewise filed within that time period. Thus, the question was whether a petition to rehear filed and decided by the general sessions court within the ten-day period for appeal tolled the period for appeal to the circuit court. The authority of the general sessions court ended when it entered a judgment in the case. It had no statutory authority to grant the relief requested and the petition did not toll the appeal period. Thus, the ten-day period for seeking a de novo review in the circuit court began to run when the general sessions final judgment was entered. Due process did not require a tolling of the ten-day period for appeal where the owner simply mistakenly presumed that the ten-day period for appeal would be tolled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner father sought an order changing his child's custody from respondent mother in the Chancery Court for Shelby County (Tennessee), alleging that there had been a material change of circumstances and that the mother had tried to minimize or negate his relationship with the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother moved to California with the child when he was two and was granted a divorce and custody by the Tennessee court. The father exercised visitation in both California and Tennessee, but primarily in California. The court found that the mother was correct to file in Tennessee because the child had not lived in California six months at the time and the Tennessee trial court had the jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-6-216(a)(1). The trial court properly found that it had lost jurisdiction pursuant to Tenn. Code &sect; 36-6-217(a)(1). The first part was met because the child and his mother had lived in California since 1996. The other requirement, that the child no longer had a significant connection with Tennessee and that substantial evidence was no longer available in Tennessee concerning his care, protection, training, and personal relationships, was also met. There was no evidence of any current connection between the child and Tennessee other than that his father lived there. Two affidavits of persons who had seen the child in Tennessee at his last visit did not support a finding of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant, the City filed a counter-complaint, alleging that statutory minimum population and distance requirements unconstitutionally deprived it of equal protection. Appellee, the Tennessee Attorney General (State), answered, denying that the statutory provisions were unconstitutional. The Chancery Court for Roane County, Tennessee, dismissed the City's counter-complaint. The City appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City challenged the requirements in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-1-201(a)(1) and 6-1-201(b)(1)(A), which precluded incorporation of territory unless such territory contained not fewer than 1,500 persons. The statute also set a three mile to five mile minimum distance for incorporation from an existing municipality, depending on the population of the municipality. In the instant case, the three mile distance applied. The appellate court rejected the City's argument that the requirements of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-1-201(a)(1) and 6-1-201(b)(1)(A) were arbitrary and capricious and violated the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8. The appellate court held that the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution was not implicated under the circumstances of the case. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-1-201(a)(1) and 6-1-201(b)(1)(A) was a general law and was constitutional. Further, Tenn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, granted judgment in favor of appellant Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance by finding that the record supported the department's conclusion that appellee insurance agent had sold policies in states where he was not licensed, but determined that the agent's license had to be suspended for six months rather than revoked. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department argued that the agent's license should have been revoked. The appellate court noted that the undisputed facts of the case established that the agent knew that he was repeatedly violating the laws of Georgia and Virginia and that he was exceeding the authority of his Tennessee license by his deliberate actions. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 56-6-161 of the Tennessee Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-101 et seq., was applicable to proceedings to revoke or suspend the license of an insurance agent. The sanctions imposed by the administrative tribunal upon the agent were clearly warranted in law. No basis existed for finding that the sanction of revocation of license was without justification in fact. The agent's repeated transgressions in taking applications for policies of insurance in Georgia and Virginia while indicating that they were executed in Tennessee were committed intentionally and with deliberation. Neither the chancery court nor the court of appeals was empowered to substitute judicial judgment in the place of the judgment of an administrative tribunal acting within the scope of its statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that the residents cited no authority indicating that such cases of great public importance were considered any differently from other cases on the trial court's dockets. The case languished on the trial court's docket for over 15 years with little or no activity. The residents were certainly aware that continued inaction would result in dismissal, but the residents made no further efforts to prosecute their case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city cited appellants, adult bookstores, for violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-51-1402. The stores filed a complaint for declaratory judgment which also requested a temporary and permanent injunction challenging the constitutionality of the Act. The Circuit Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) entered an order denying the injunction and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and upheld the statute. The bookstores appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The civil court did not have authority to enjoin the enforcement of a criminal statute. While it was correct in denying the stores' motions for temporary and permanent injunction, the trial court erred in finding that the doctrine of former suit pending barred the stores from bringing an action in civil court while the prosecutions proceeded against their employees, for violation of the Act, in criminal courts. The stores alleged that the court's sua sponte dismissal of all of their claims was improper because they were denied the opportunity to argue those claims fully. The trial court, in ruling on the merits of the constitutional claims upon a hearing of their motions for temporary injunction, either effectively issued a declaratory judgment or dismissed the action on its merits. In either event, the trial court went beyond the proper scope of a hearing on a motion for temporary injunction. The appellate court found nothing in the record that indicated that the trial court properly ordered the consolidation of the hearing of the application for temporary injunction with a trial on the merits, and it was clear that both sides desired a full trial on the merits at a later date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court denying the motions for temporary injunction was affirmed, and the order in all other respects was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court for such further proceedings on the declaratory judgment action consistent with the appellate opinion. Costs of the appeal were assessed one-half to the bookstores and one-half to the city and the Attorney General.</SPAN></P>

The comparison of benefits under the settlement agreement with benefits under the Tennessee Child Support Guidelines clearly showed that the contractual benefits did not conform economically to the benefits which would have accrued had the guidelines been followed in lieu of the parties' private agreement. By the trial court's own calculations, the contractual benefit was $ 1,000 per month while the benefits under the guidelines as set by the trial court's order were $ 1,671 per month. The trial court offered no other explanation that would support an allowable deviation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ruling of the trial court that the settlement agreement was void was affirmed. Prospective child support was modified. The trial court's ruling on retroactive child support was reversed. An upward deviation as to retroactive support was denied, but such deviation as to future support was granted. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court rejected the inmate's arguments and held: (1) the Department was not required to follow the rules and regulations of the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act in establishing the lethal injection protocol; (2) the Nonlivestock Animal Humane Death Act did not apply to the execution of a human being by lethal injection pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-23-114; (3) although the manner in which a warden mixed Sodium Pentothal for executions did not meet requirements for dispensing controlled substances, the warden was exempted from the requirements in the Tennessee Drug Control Act of 1989 and the Tennessee Pharmacy Practice Act of 1996; (4) the Department's protocol of mixing three lethal drugs for an execution did not violate either Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bondsmen filed their action after the court decreed that all bonds set by that court in the amount of $ 4,400 or less were to be granted bond by the signature of two property owners living in the county, and that property tax receipts and signatures of the parties were sufficient for release from custody. The bondsmen claimed that the trial court's order violated the Release from Custody and Bail Reform Act of 1978 (Act), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-11-101 - 40-11-144 (2003) as the order purported to take away the authority of the sheriff or judicial commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the surety, a power set out in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-11-106(b)(1). The appellate court agreed and held that the statutory scheme of the Act clearly contemplated that while the judge or magistrate would determine whether defendants would be released upon their own recognizance, upon conditions, or upon admission to bail, it was within the authority of the sheriff or judicial commissioner to determine the sufficiency of a surety or validity of a bond. Thus, the trial court's judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 55-8-108(e), in the father's wrongful death action that arose as the result of a high speed police chase of his son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father claimed the trial court erred in dismissing the action because it could not be established from the complaint that the decedent was an &quot;actual or suspected violator of the law&quot; for purposes of Tenn.

The court held that the issue of whether or not decedent had the capacity to commit a crime was not determinative because the scope of &sect; 55-8-108(e) was very broad and applied to both criminal and civil violations. The court found that the complaint alleged that the officer pursued the decedent based on a description of the vehicle and driver, thus decedent was a &quot;suspected violator of a law or ordinance,&quot; and defendants were not liable for his injuries. The court rejected the father's claim that &sect; 55-8-108(e) was unconstitutional under the federal and state constitutions because the issue was not properly before the court. The trial court did not rule on the issue, and the notice requirements of Tenn. R. Civ. P. 24.04 were not complied within the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment dismissing the father's wrongful death action and remanded the case with costs assessed to the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners asserted that they were entitled to bring the action, being adjoining landowners. The appellate court determined that the statute the landowners relied upon, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-51-103, had been declared unconstitutional. The legislature did not take further actions concerning the provisions of the statute since 1989, and thus, the only property owners allowed to contest an annexation ordinance by way of the quo warranto proceeding were those who owned property within the annexed area. It was the appellate court's duty to grant the city's motion to dismiss because there were no other statutes which allowed adjacent landowners to contest annexation ordinances. The landowners did not own property within the annexed territory, and thus could not claim the right to challenge an annexation ordinance under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-51-103. The annexation ordinance did not include the landowners and their property. The quo warranto remedy was not available to the landowners. The landowners lacked legal standing to challenge the annexation ordinance at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband claimed that the wife's cohabitation with another man terminated his obligation, as she was being supported by that third person and was in no need of alimony. The trial court held that the wife was no longer living with the third person and had rebutted the presumption that she did not need the alimony and that no material change in circumstances had occurred to warrant modification of the initial alimony award. The court found that the evidence supported those holdings. Because the wife was not receiving support from the third person as of the trial, the situation justifying alimony reduction or termination had ceased to exist. The wife's financial support to the parties' adult child was not unforeseeable or unanticipated, and she demonstrated that she was in need of the continuing alimony payments. The court concluded that, while Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-103(c) authorized a trial court to award attorney fees to an alimony recipient who was forced to defend an action to reduce or terminate that alimony, fees should not have been awarded to the wife, because it could not be said that the husband's attempt to reduce or terminate alimony was unwarranted or without basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operators asserted that the trial court erred in its application of the doctrine of elision. The city cross-appealed, arguing that the trial court erred by finding the elided portion unconstitutional. The appellate court determined that the ordinance prohibited horse-drawn carriages from standing within 100 feet of a restaurant not for the protection of the restaurant business per se, but as a matter of public health and welfare. The section was part of an overall regulatory scheme affecting matters of public health and welfare. The consent provision permitted restaurant owners to waive a restriction that served to protect the public health and welfare. It contained no standards for determining when such a waiver was appropriate or for review by the city of whether the waiver adversely affected those that the section protected. Therefore, the consent provision unlawfully delegated the city's police and legislative powers to private citizens. Absent the consent provision, the section fulfilled its objective of protecting the public health and welfare. The doctrine of elision was properly applied.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that the pivotal issue was whether the courts had subject matter jurisdiction to enforce or modify administrative orders issued under &sect; 36-5-103(f).

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-5-812 and 813 together, the legislature clearly conferred to the courts subject matter jurisdiction over enforcement of administrative orders of support issued under &sect; 36-5-103(f). The court may enforce its own support orders and those issued by the State pursuant to contempt orders. The trial court clearly had jurisdiction to modify the child support order previously modified by the department. The trial court erred in dismissing the State's petition to modify without reaching the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Tennessee Department of Children's Services (DCS), filed an action seeking the termination of respondent father's parental rights. The Juvenile Court for Greene County, Tennessee, terminated the parental relationship on statutory grounds of non-support, non visitation, and best interests, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-102(1)(A); Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(c). The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that his son was hidden from him, thereby frustrating his efforts to support or visit him. The court found, however, that the record reflected clear and convincing evidence supporting a statutory grant for the termination and that the termination was in the child's best interests. The father was obligated by two judicial orders to keep his wife and mother-in-law informed of his address. He knew two years before the trial that his son had been moved to Tennessee, and he knew six months before the trial that his son was in State custody. Yet he made no effort whatever to contact DCS. Finally, the DCS representative recited her rejected efforts to involve the father in the life of his son, all of which he ignored. The father made no claim that he was unable to support his son. He simply failed to do so for years. He basically just allowed the child to not be a part of his life. He had no mailing address; he maintained contact &quot;with the world&quot; through his sister; he resided in a dilapidated trailer; he had no drivers license, no job, no funds. He appeared to be a vagabond by choice, as he found employment when he chose to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Costs were assessed to the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Tennessee filed a delinquent tax suit against the taxpayer. Notice of the tax sale was given to the taxpayer and the creditor, who held an equitable interest in the property through a second mortgage. The buyer purchased the property at the tax sale, and the sale was confirmed on October 2, 2000. On November 14, 2000, the creditor filed a notice of redemption for the property, and the buyer was sent a notice of redemption informing him that he had 30-days from November 14 to seek additional lawful compensation or to otherwise protest the redemption. The buyer did not file any claims in accordance with the notice he received on November 15, 2000. The appellate court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-5-2702(a) granted the trial court in rem jurisdiction of the taxpayer's property for up to a year after the tax sale, until August 2001. The buyer was sent the letter of notice well within the statutory requirements of due process, and the buyer was provided the right to protest at a hearing, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-5-2704.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff product purchaser appealed from a judgment of the Law Court for Sullivan County (Tennessee), which denied its motion for class certification in its illegal price-fixing action against defendant product seller. The trial court had granted the purchaser's motion to dismiss a claim under the Tennessee Trade Practices Act (TTPA), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-25-101 et seq. (2001), but denied its motion for summary judgment on unjust enrichment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchaser alleged that the seller engaged in illegal price-fixing of sorbates. Although the purchaser bought and sold sorbates directly, the action was based on its indirect purchases from supermarkets as an end-user of sorbates that were in the products purchased. Previously, the sellers had pled guilty to price-fixing of sorbates and had settled lawsuits by both direct and indirect purchasers. The trial court's dismissal of the TTPA claim was based on its holding that the TTPA did not apply to indirect purchasers or out-of-state transactions. On appeal, the court found that, based on a recently issued opinion, the TTPA did apply to indirect purchasers. However, as the purchaser was unable to show that its purchases of sorbates &quot;substantially affected&quot; Tennessee commerce, the holding that the TTPA did not apply to the purchaser's claim was proper. The purchaser did not show compliance with Tenn. R. Civ. P. 23.02(3) for purposes of class certification, nor were the prerequisites of a common question of law or fact and typicality of claim satisfied. Lastly, summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim was properly denied, as questions of fact as to the choice of law remained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment of the trial court by noting that the TTPA applied to indirect purchasers. As modified, the court affirmed the judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual filed a lawsuit against appellee Governor, challenging the practice of serving meat and drink at political fund raisers, alleging that the practice violated Tenn. Const. art. X, &sect; 3. The Governor filed a motion for sanctions, pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 11. On remand, the Circuit Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) granted the motion and imposed as a sanction a screening mechanism. The individual appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual claimed that the screening mechanism imposed against him violated his constitutional rights. He acknowledged having filed a series of lawsuits asserting violations of Tenn. Const. art. X, &sect; 3 and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-19-126 and that various courts had declined to accept his interpretation of those laws. He claimed, however, that those lawsuits were filed in order to protect the constitution. The appellate court held that the two year screening mechanism imposed by the trial court was narrowly tailored and short in duration, effectively curbing for a defined period of time any repetitive or frivolous lawsuits filed by the individual, and was fully warranted, given his undisputed history of filing such lawsuits. The screening mechanism did not prevent him from filing another lawsuit. It prevented him only from relitigating essentially the same lawsuit. The Court of Appeals of Tennessee, Nashville, had great respect for the need to litigate novel interpretations of the constitution and had respect as well for the sincerity of the individual's beliefs. However, the appellate court had to respect the need for other litigants to have the courts hear their lawsuits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, in the complaint, the contractors also asserted a violation of the prohibition against malicious harassment, pursuant to Tenn.

Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-307(a)(1)(N), which stated that the claims commission had jurisdiction to determine a claim against the State for the negligent deprivation of a statutory right. The appellate court held that that section required that the contractors showed that the legislature expressly conferred a private right of action against the State. The claims commission found that it lacked jurisdiction over that claim, holding that there was no express private right of action by an individual against the State conferred by the statute. However, since a state university was considered a &quot;person&quot; under the Human Rights Act, and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-21-701 expressly granted a right of action against such a &quot;person&quot; for malicious harassment, the appellate court concluded that the claims commission had had jurisdiction over the malicious harassment claim pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-307(a)(1)(N).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part, the holding by the commission that it lacked jurisdiction over the claim of malicious harassment was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner operated an adult bookstore in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

The primary issues on appeal concerned whether the Chattanooga ordinance regulating adult oriented establishments provided the necessary procedural safeguards required by the First Amendment to be considered facially constitutional under the federal Constitution. The Court of Appeals of Tennessee concluded that the licensing scheme provided the necessary First Amendment procedural safeguards. There was sufficient evidence presented to revoke the license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an employment tax case, appellant, the State of Tennessee, appealed the determination of the Tennessee Claims Commission that appellee employer was not liable for state employment tax by virtue of a federal safe harbor provision. The commissioner thus entered judgment for the employer, ordering the State to return all funds paid under protest by the employer and awarding the employer post judgment interest of 10 percent. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development (DLWD) determined that the employer's stage hands were employees and not independent contractors, and that the employer accordingly was liable for state employment taxes. The policy behind the Tennessee's Employment Security Law was to protect workers in Tennessee from involuntary unemployment. The statute contained no safe harbor provision parallel to the federal safe harbor provision known as &sect; 530, 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3401 note, and that federal provision did not further the state's public policy as defined by the Tennessee legislature. The State, therefore, was not bound to provide liability protection parallel to &sect; 530 for state employment tax purposes. Thus, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 50-7-102 and -104 (1999) did not mandate a safe harbor provision parallel to &sect; 530. Therefore, the State was not required to relieve the employer from state employment tax liability when the employer had obtained &sect; 530 relief from federal employment tax liability. Additionally, the employer withdrew its challenge regarding whether its workers were employees and not independent contractors; thus, the employer was liable for state employment taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the Commission erred by denying the motion for summary judgment because it was entitled to discretionary function immunity. The court of appeals disagreed.

Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-301, et seq. Discretionary function immunity was a qualified (good faith) immunity rather than an absolute immunity and by the express provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-307(d) could not be relied upon by the State in an action before the Commission. The question of notice of a dangerous conditions remained for trial, and therefore, the trial court properly denied the motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The State filed a motion to dismiss, which the Tennessee Claims Commission for the Eastern Grand (Commission) granted. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to conversations with his attorney, the inmate knew he was being tried, convicted, and sentenced in absentia. Eventually, the inmate filed his claim against the State with the Tennessee Division of Claims Administration alleging that the trial judge deprived him of his statutory rights because the indictments against him were void and because he was tried, convicted, and sentenced in absentia. The case was transferred to the Commission. The appellate court found that the Commission properly held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the inmate's claim and that the inmate failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because none of the statutes he based his claim on conferred a private right of action on him. Additionally, the inmate filed his claim against the State well beyond the one-year statute of limitations. Also, the inmate had full knowledge of the facts relevant to his alleged injury when it occurred because he knew that he was being tried and sentenced in absentia. Thus, the Commission properly held the inmate's claim was barred by the statute of limitations. Therefore, the Commission did not err when it dismissed the inmate's claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the father and mother divorced, the mother was awarded custody of the parties' daughter and the father was ordered to pay child support plus a clerk's fee for processing the payments.

However, the trial court denied the State's request to collect the statutory processing fee under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-21-403(a) (2002) and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-116(a) (2002 &amp; Supp. 2003) and cited a perceived violation of an unspecified federal law. On appeal, the court reversed. Regardless of the merits of the trial court's legal conclusion, the issue of the legality of the processing fee was not timely presented in order to properly litigate the issue and the trial court acted precipitously in holding that the statutory fee violated federal law and could not be enforced. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Appellee mother then filed a petition for contempt, alleging that appellant father had violated the order by allowing their child to be in the presence of the father's &quot;gay lover&quot; at the father's apartment and that the father told the child that he was gay. The Chancery Court for Williamson County (Tennessee) found the father in contempt. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father asserted that the restraining order was overbroad and/or vague, not issued pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ.

The appellate court found that the prohibition against &quot;taking the child around or otherwise exposing the child to his gay lover(s) and/or his gay lifestyle&quot; was not so vague or overly broad as to have been unenforceable. However, the appellate court found that it did not put the father on notice that he was restrained from telling his son that he was gay. The appellate court did not read the restraining order to prohibit such a statement. Thus, the appellate court found that the father did not have notice that he was prohibited from telling his son he was gay and therefore could not have been held in contempt for having done so. The mother argued that the father's act of telling his son that he was gay was against the advice of their child's counselor. The appellate court held that, while the father violated the understanding he had with his child's counselor, that understanding was not the equivalent of an order of the court, thus the father's violation of that understanding was not a contemptuous act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court erred by granting visitation to the grandmother. The court of appeals agreed. The trial court found that prior to the mother's death there existed a significant relationship between the child and his grandmother. However, regardless of whether the evidence supported that finding, there was simply no evidence of the danger of substantial harm to the child because of the cessation of that relationship or otherwise. There was no evidence that the father was anything but a fit parent or that the child was in any danger of harm from his living environment or from the father's parenting decisions. The trial court found that the total absence of a relationship with the grandmother and the maternal side of his family would result in substantial harm to the child. There was simply no proof of such harm. The psychologist appointed by the trial court, relying in part on the child's statements, reported a conclusion contrary to that finding. Therefore, the trial court erred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, certain hotels, motels, and taxpayers, challenged a decision from the Chancery Court for Shelby County (Tennessee), which entered judgment in favor of defendant municipalities by finding that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-1425 (2003) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-1425 (2003) governed occupancy taxes on hotels and motels. The hotels, motels, and the taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 67-4-1425. After the trial court determined that &sect; 67-4-1425 was constitutional, an appeal was filed. On review, the court determined that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear some of the claims. The taxpayers were not required to pay the tax &quot;under protest&quot; pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1-911 before challenging the tax. The claims against one municipality should have been dismissed for lack of ripeness because the tax had not been imposed there. Further, the hotels and motels lacked standing to bring the action because they were not the taxpayers in the case. Turning to the merits of the case, the court determined that the proper standard of review was the rational basis standard. The court held that the double taxation exclusions in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-1425(c), (d) (2003) did not violate Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8 and Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 8. The rapid growth of other counties excluded from double taxation was a reason to justify the classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision regarding the claims against one municipality and the claims brought by the hotels and motels. The rest of the trial court's decision was affirmed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company owned and operated videotape movie rental stores and opened up a store in Knoxville where it began selling and renting videotapes for home viewing. The front room of the store was stocked with a mix of videotapes rated G, PG-13, and R, and the back room of the store was stocked with sexually explicit X-rated tapes. The city filed a complaint requesting that temporary and permanent injunctions be issued against the company alleging that it violated Knoxville City Code &sect; 16-468 because it was operating an &quot;adult bookstore&quot; in violation of that section. The trial court enjoined the company from operating the video store, but the court reversed, stating that &sect; 16-468 was unconstitutional and unenforceable. The court stated that the problem with the use of terms such as &quot;significant&quot; or &quot;substantial&quot; contained in &sect; 16-468 was that they must suffice for application to a wide range of situations across a broad spectrum. Without more specificity, there would be inevitable disagreement as to those situations near the middle of the spectrum. Thus, &sect; 16-468 was unconstitutionally vague, and therefore unenforceable. The temporary injunction violated Tenn. R. Civ. P. 65.02(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and declared the relevant City of Knoxville Code section unconstitutional. The court further remanded the cause as to the matter of damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A leased vehicle was seized pursuant to laws that provided for the forfeiture of a vehicle used in the commission of a person's second or subsequent offense of driving while intoxicated. Appellee credit corporation owned the vehicle. The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, held that appellant, the Tennessee Department of Safety, failed to give the credit corporation proper notice of the forfeiture proceeding. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department sent certified letters containing information about the forfeiture warrant to the credit corporation (for a major automobile manufacturer) at the address listed on the vehicle's certificate of title and registration. However, the certified letter sent to the credit corporation was returned and marked &quot;Not Deliverable as Addressed Unable to Forward.&quot; Thereupon, the Department issued a summary order of forfeiture. The trial court noted the credit corporation was the kind of entity that anyone with the least bit of sense would have known could have been located with little effort. Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 prohibited the State from taking property without due process of law. The appellate court noted that adequate notice was an essential element of due process, and notice had to be given in a manner reasonably calculated to notify all interested parties of the pending forfeiture. Here, no such effort was made. Because the Department failed to exert the minimal effort required to ascertain the credit corporation's correct address, it was deprived of the opportunity to be present at a hearing to assert its claim. Thus, the notice failed to satisfy due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant firefighter who was employed by appellee city and forced to retire at age 62 pursuant to the city's mandatory retirement policy, filed a lawsuit against the city asserting that the mandatory retirement policy violated the Tennessee Human Rights Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-21-401, by discriminating against him based on his age. The Chancery Court for Hardin County (Tennessee) granted summary judgment for the city. The firefighter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighter argued that the city was required to show age to have been a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ). The parties did not dispute that the city was permitted to establish age 62 as a mandatory retirement age if it had proven age to have been a BFOQ for a firefighter. The threshold issue was whether the city was required to prove that age was a BFOQ. The Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Jackson, held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-36-205 authorized the city to adopt a mandatory retirement policy, not less than 60 years old, for firefighters, without being required to establish age as a BFOQ. Since the Tennessee legislature could not, of course, carve out an exception to the federal statute prohibiting age discrimination, &sect; 8-36-205 included the proviso that the mandatory age requirement not violate the federal act. No such reference was made to the prohibition against age discrimination in the Tennessee Human Rights Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-21-401. The legislature intended to create an express exception to the Tennessee statute prohibiting age discrimination, to permit a municipality to adopt a mandatory age requirement for firefighters without having to show a BFOQ.</SPAN></P>

The application was filed pursuant to the provisions of the &quot;Jackson Law,&quot; Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 68-211-701, et seq. The commission denied the application. After petitioning for judicial review, the Chancery Court for Loudon County (Tennessee) held in favor of the commission. The landfill operator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, the operator contended that the trial court's consideration of the facts in light of the &quot;substantial and material evidence&quot; rule and its determination that the commission acted &quot;arbitrarily or capriciously&quot; were improper, as the Jackson Law's mandate of de novo review was, according to the operator, clearly a &quot;species of the statutory writ of certiorari.&quot; The &quot;substantial and material evidence rule&quot; and the &quot;arbitrary or capricious rule&quot; required that some substantial reason be proven for refusing the permit before the commission could validly refuse the permit. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 68-211-704(c) required the reviewing court to consider all evidence presented to the commission, plus any relevant evidence presented to the trial court and to decide de novo the factual question of whether a fact or facts exist which justified the refusal of the permit. Following Tucker, the appellate court found no error in the trial court's interpretation of de novo review under the Jackson Law. The trial court correctly refused to substitute its independent judgment for that of the commission, since such a substitution was &quot;clearly not the legislative intent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the administratrix of estate of deceased husband, filed a wrongful death action against defendants, an anesthesiologist and anesthesia services group. The jury in the Circuit Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, returned a verdict for plaintiff, finding defendants at fault and awarding damages for medical and funeral expenses, and the pecuniary value of the life of the deceased. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During voir dire in a medical malpractice trial, plaintiff exercised eight peremptory challenges. Ultimately, the jury found for plaintiff. On review, the court of appeals held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 22-3-105 (1994) limited a single plaintiff party in a civil action to four peremptory challenges. The trial court's failure to comply with the procedural guidelines set forth in &sect; 22-3-105 constituted prejudice to the judicial process, and required a reversal in this case under Tenn. R. App. P. 36(b). The court of appeals also found reversible error in the improper use of medical literature to impeach an expert witness' credibility; counsel failed to establish the literature as reliable authority. Counsel also erred in asking the expert to cite to medical authority supporting his position on cross-examination. The trial court did not err in retrospective application of a rule allowing decedent's family to recovery loss of consortium damages. The trial judge did not improperly comment upon the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment on the jury verdict was vacated, and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellee mother's action for an increase in child support, appellant father challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), including the father's income in excess of $ 10,000 per month in calculating his child support obligation. Appellant attorney general filed a notice of appeal to defend the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-101(e)(1)(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court made a factual finding that the father's gross income was $ 275,000 per year. Accordingly, child support was set at $ 3,342 per month. On appeal, the father asserted that the mother failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the child support based on income greater than $ 10,000 per month was reasonably necessary to provide for the needs for the minor child, as contemplated in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-101(e)(1)(B). The appellate court held that the mother showed that child support based on the father's net income in excess of $ 10,000 per month was reasonably necessary to provide for the child, as the mother was unable to afford her half of the child's private school education expenses, and she testified that if she received more child support, she would re-enroll the child in private school, and would provide art and dance lessons, as well as educational travel. Additionally, although the trial court did not use the term &quot;reasonably necessary,&quot; its written finding was equivalent to a finding that the increased support was reasonably necessary to provide for the child's needs. Finally, the constitutional issue was waived by the mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed, the mother's request for attorney's fees for the appeal was granted, and the case was remanded for a determination of the amount of attorney's fees for the appeal. Costs on appeal were taxed to the father and his surety, for which execution could issue, if necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department filed a petition to terminate the parents' rights to their three children on the ground that one of the children was sexually abused by the father.

The court found that there had been no judicial finding of child abuse. There was no physical evidence of sexual abuse against any of the children. The Department did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that the father abused any of the children. The court further found that the Department failed to provide clear and convincing proof that the parents had abandoned the children by willful failure to support or visit. The Department's records refuted the claim that the parents demonstrated a lack of concern in the months immediately following removal of the children from their custody. The Department failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence the existence of any one ground for termination. However, the court found that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to order the children's return home.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. The father's conduct throughout the case did not evince a purpose to forego parental claims to his children or an overall lack of parental responsibility. To the contrary, the father sought custody early on and continued to seek custody. The only apparent and expressed reason the State took the children in custody after removing them from the mother's home was the unsuitability of the father's housing. The father attempted to comply with directives given him by the State, and it stated that he had substantially complied with those requirements. He cooperated with workers and agencies that attempted to help him. Therefore, the trial court erred in finding that the father had abandoned his children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sought placement at a minimum security facility and claimed that the denial was based upon the fact that he allegedly had an escape charge and/or history.

He sought a writ of certiorari, a declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief. The trial court dismissed the inmate's petition for failure to state a claim. The inmate appealed, contending that the application of the new rule, regulation, law, policy, and/or practice to his earlier infraction violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws and that the defendants were acting in an arbitrary, illegal, and unconstitutional manner. The court affirmed the trial court, finding that a writ of certiorari was not available, as there was no action taken by an inferior tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial functions. The court further found that the case did not involve a violation of the ex post facto prohibition and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to otherwise consider the inmate's petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner in the custody of the Tennessee Department of Correction became eligible for parole after serving over 20 years of his sentence. The Tennessee Board of Paroles conducted a hearing and voted to deny him parole. They also decided to defer further parole consideration for another 20 years. The prisoner filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) denied. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both versions of the rule at issue stated that, if the case was continued or parole denied, a future hearing date should be specified, with the 1 year requirement deleted from the amended rule. The state's argument implied that the amended rule granted the board absolute and unbridled discretion over the timing of subsequent hearings. It appeared to the appellate court that the statutes relating to the Board of Paroles, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-28-116(a)(1) and 40-28-118(d), did not support that interpretation. Under the board's ruling, it was possible that the entire membership of the board could completely turn over more than once before the prisoner's case came up for decision again. The board's decision constituted an arbitrary withdrawal of the power to parole from future board members, and a 20-year deferral would undermine the very provisions of the parole statutes that empowered the board to grant parole. In addition, the essential effect of the board's action was to change the prisoner's sentence to life without parole, contrary to what the legislature intended. The appellate court held that the prisoner stated a cause of action that entitled him to a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>

The indirect purchasers of the software appealed the decision of the trial court dismissing the claims of the direct purchasers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchasers filed suit seeking damages, injunctive relief, and equitable remedies under the TTPA, Tenn.

They alleged that the company engaged in conduct that eliminated or retarded the development of new software products that could support or become alternative platforms to the company's operating systems. They also contended that the price that they paid for their software was higher than it would have been in a competitive market. The appellate court concluded that the purchasers sufficiently alleged substantial effects on commerce within the State to state a claim under the TTPA and that the indirect purchasers could sue for injury caused them by violations of the TTPA. Thus, the trial court properly denied the company's motion to dismiss the purchasers' TTPA claims. However, the purchasers' TCPA claims had to be dismissed, as their claims based upon anticompetitive conduct were not cognizable under the TCPA. Thus, the trial court erred in denying the company's motion to dismiss those claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company executed a sublease agreement that allowed it to construct a cellular telecommunications tower, for which the sublessor had obtained a building permit. After the sublease was executed, the company secured a new building permit in its own name. The county closed down the project when it received complaints from residents, who had discovered that the company had not obtained a certificate of appropriateness (COA) from the development authority, a prerequisite for a building permit. A county commission ruled in favor of the residents. The company alleged in its lawsuit against defendants that it acquired vested property rights in the building permit. The trial court entered judgment for defendants. The court affirmed. The issuance of a COA was a prerequisite to the issuance of a valid building permit, and the company's failure to obtain a COA before seeking the permit rendered the issued permit invalid. The company thus had not acquired a vested property right in the invalid permit. The company could not rely on estoppel because the statute that set forth the COA requirement, the Tennessee Technology Corridor Development Authority Act, was in the public domain.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the mother's relationship with the boyfriend continued even at the time of the hearing. The permanency plan also required a stable home for the children. The mother had moved 13 times between 1994 and the time of the hearing, and, thus, had not provided a stable home. The mother acknowledged living at nine different addresses. The mother, by her own admission, was not in compliance with the counseling requirement. There was clear and convincing evidence of the mother's substantial noncompliance with the permanency plan, and therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother argued that the trial court erred by awarding custody to the father because the evidence preponderated against the trial court's finding that the father did not willfully abandon the children. The court of appeals agreed. It was undisputed that the father knew where his children were and where to send the child support payments had he chosen to do so. The father's only explanation for his failure to support was that sometimes he did not make much money, and that his income depended on the jobs he received. It was therefore established by undisputed evidence that the father's failure to pay child support was willful. In addition, the father had abandoned the children for an extended period of time. Indeed, as of the date of the divorce, it was clear that the father had in fact abandoned them. The mother brought the children to Birmingham, where the father was living, and they saw him there. The father's visitation with the children as of the date of the divorce could only be characterized as &quot;token.&quot; Therefore, the trial court erred by awarding custody to the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff minor appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Knox County (Tennessee), which granted summary judgment on all claims to defendant county and defendant sheriff, and summary judgment on most claims to defendant county medical examiner. The minor had alleged liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor, who had an interest in a medical career, drove around with the examiner in the examiner's county vehicle for the purpose of observing him on the job. At one point, the examiner invited the minor back to the examiner's home where he drugged him and took nude photos of him. The court held that the county was not negligent under &sect; 29-20-205 of the Governmental Tort Liability Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-20-205, because there was no evidence that any county employee was, or should have been, aware of the examiner's propensity to sedate and photograph young men. Although the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the county and the sheriff under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, it did vacate the grant of summary judgment to the examiner under &sect; 1983 in his individual capacity because there was an issue of whether he misused his power and position as examiner in order to coerce the minor into a situation where he could be taken advantage of. The court also vacated the grant of summary judgment in favor of the county under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-8-302 because there was an issue as to whether the examiner was acting as a deputy sheriff under color of his office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition for termination of use of land as a cemetery. Appellants, landowners, a tax assessor's office, and an interest group, filed a counter petition seeking money damages as well as an injunction preventing disinterment of the graves. The State filed a motion to dismiss the counter petition. The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, granted the State's motion. Appellants filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State petitioned to disinter ancient Native American remains located on State property that had been acquired by eminent domain. The issue before the court on appeal was the dismissal of a counter petition filed by appellants after the court denied their right to intervene in the action. The court determined that appellants could not appeal the dismissal of their counter petition, as there never was a valid counter petition. In order for appellants to have filed a valid counter petition, they would have had to have been parties to the action which, by virtue of the denial of their motion to intervene, they were not. The grant of amicus curiae status upon appellants did not create a vested interest sufficient to prevent the State from taking a voluntary dismissal. The court's decision did not prejudice appellants' ability to have their concerns addressed, because the constitutionality of the encapsulation of the burial sites in concrete and subsequent paving over of the sites was being challenged in a separate lawsuit.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held willful non-payment of child support or failure to make reasonable payments toward child support for four consecutive months immediately preceding the filing of the petition to terminate rights, established a basis to sever a parent's relationship with his child. The appellate court noted the state supreme court had previously found later statutory definitions of abandonment unconstitutional because they effectively created an irrebuttable presumption that a mere failure to pay support constituted abandonment and reinstated the definition in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-102(1)(A)(I) (Supp. 1994). The appellate court concluded the trial court applied the correct legal standard and properly terminated the father's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

After giving the father a second chance to establish a relationship with the child based on a psychological finding that he and the mother worked nicely as a team, appellee Department of Children's Services petitioned to terminate father's parental rights, alleging that he willfully abandoned the child by failing to pay child support, that the conditions that led to the child's removal persisted, and that he was mentally incompetent to parent the child. The court terminated his parental rights. On appeal, the father argued that no specific order had ever been entered requiring him to pay child support, so it was error to base the termination on his wilful failure to pay. However, the court noted that a parent's obligation of support was so obvious that the father's professed lack of knowledge militated for terminating his rights. The termination was upheld as being in the best interest of the child.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment, the corporation sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the city was authorized to charge connection fees for new connections to a water or sewer system, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-34-104. However, the city did not have the authority to levy a tax for such a purpose. The fees did not constitute a tax because the revenues generated were not paid into the city's general fund. Moreover, they were not levied or used for the purpose of paying the city's general debts and liabilities. Further, Clarksville, Tenn., Codified Ordinance &sect; 13-309 did not violate equal protection because there was a reasonable basis for the connection fee. Because the reasonable basis test was met, there was no violation of equal protection merely because there was a resulting inequality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Juvenile Court for Hamilton County (Tennessee) determined there were sufficient grounds to terminate appellant mother's parental rights to her three youngest children. The mother appealed, and claimed that appellee department of children's services (DCS) failed to prove that there were sufficient grounds to terminate her parental rights and that such termination would be in the best interests of the children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother contacted DCS and asked for assistance in caring for her five minor children and informed DCS that she was two months behind on her rent, was having emotional problems, and was undergoing counseling. DCS obtained temporary custody of the five minor children. DCS later sought to terminate the mother's parental rights. Custody of the mother's two oldest children was transferred to their biological father. A permanency plan was developed with the stated goal of returning the children to the mother. However, there was substantial noncompliance with the terms of the plan by the mother. The mother consistently was unable to support the children financially. The mother admitted that she was unable to care for the children for the two years they were in DCS custody. The mother's last minute ability to secure employment two days before the second day of trial began, as well as the scheduling of a therapy session in the near future was, quite simply, too little too late. The present court did not believe that the juvenile court committed any reversible error in reaching its conclusion that clear and convincing evidence existed to terminate the mother's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the juvenile court was affirmed, and the cause was remanded to the juvenile court. The costs on appeal were assessed against the mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

More than 2 years later, the Department filed a petition to terminate parental rights. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence did not preponderate against the findings that the grounds for termination in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(g) (2001) existed and that the termination was in the child's best interest. The mother failed to support or visit the child regularly for more than two years. The mother claimed she did not have transportation, but she admitted to having transportation for other needs. The mother met only one of the requirements on her permanency plan and failed to attend doctor visits, attend therapy to improve her parenting skills, show that she could administer the child's medication, or obtain reliable transportation. Also, the child had previously been in the Department's care. The child also expressed a desire to be adopted and made great improvements in foster care.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) ordered a husband involved in a divorce to pay $ 230 per week in support payments to appellee wife after the husband retired. The husband designated his daughter as the beneficiary to receive the payments if he died within the 120 month period. After the husband's untimely death, the court ordered appellants, his ex-employer and/or his daughter, to make the payments to the wife and they appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both the daughter and the ex-employer objected to having been made parties and the court originally sustained the objection. But without any further process having being served, the court ordered them to take steps necessary to have seen that the wife received part of the pension. The appellate court held that the court's order was void because of a lack of jurisdiction over the ex-employer and the daughter. The trial court's subsequent joinder of the ex-employer and the daughter had no effect on the invalid judgment. In 1988 the General Assembly provided that a pension could be reached to provide support under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-501. That remained the only exception, however; therefore, the pension could not have been assigned to a spouse as a division of property. So, even with jurisdiction over the ex-employer it would have been an error to have ordered the ex-employer to have divided the pension. One way to divide a pension was to order the recipient to pay part of it to the other spouse. That was apparently what the trial court intended to do in the case at bar, but the order could not have bound the daughter because she had not been a party to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court's order attempting to bind the daughter and the ex-employer was reversed and the ex-employer was dismissed. The cause was remanded for further proceedings. The costs were taxed to the wife.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Tennessee Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Act (USTA) made the release of petroleum from underground tanks illegal. Appellant service station owner contested a fine imposed by appellee Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC). The Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) held that Tenn. Const. art. VI &sect; 14 did not preclude imposition of a fine, even though the fine was punitive. The service station owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The TDEC found that the service station owner failed to submit a Site Status Monitoring Report on two occasions. Hence the total of $ 15,000 in penalties. Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14 had a provision called the &quot;Fifty Dollar Clause,&quot; which provided no fine could be laid on any citizen that exceeded $ 50 dollars, unless it was assessed by a jury of a person's peers. The inquiry on appeal boiled down to a question of whether the latter provision applied to the government as a whole or only to the judiciary. The appellate court concluded that Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14 did apply only to the judiciary and not to the government as a whole. The statute under which the Board assessed the service station owner was titled &quot;Civil Penalty,&quot; Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 68-215-121. Giving the TDEC the benefit of the doubt, the appellate court would not say that the service station owner's assessment was punitive, based on &sect; 68-215-121 alone. However, the appellate court held the two $ 7,500 fines must have been assessed primarily to punish the service station owner, and they would be subject to the Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14 limitation, if that provision applied to administrative agencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancery court's conclusion that the fines were remedial was reversed. The chancery court's judgment affirming the action of the petroleum underground storage tank board was affirmed. The cause was remanded to the chancery court for further proceedings. Costs of the appeal were taxed to the service station owner.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's order stated that the court reviewed the administrative record, considered the additional testimony and documentary evidence offered by the grocer and found based upon said stipulations and the undisputed facts set forth in the administrative record, that the grocer had violated the ordinance by the sale of beer to a minor. The order indicated that the trial court had conducted a de novo review as it was required to have done. The testimony of the police officer was unchallenged and the past violations of the grocer, were stipulated. Collierville, Tenn., City Ord. &sect; 2-223(8), allowed the board, in assessing a penalty, to have considered the past record of the permit holder and location.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city filed an action for injunctive and declaratory relief against defendants, a newly incorporated town, the county administrator of elections, the election committee and certain members, and the town mayor, claiming that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-1-210(b) (2001), under which the town became incorporated, was unconstitutional. The Chancery Court for Fayette County (Tennessee) granted summary judgment to the city. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An unincorporated territory voted to incorporate as a town, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-1-201 (1996). The city, which shared boundaries with the new town, filed the instant action to have the election declared invalid, arguing that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-1-210(b) (amended 2001), which ratified the town's election, was unconstitutional. The town and the mayor claimed that the action was barred by the statute of limitations for election contests at Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-17-105 (1994). On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment to the city on constitutionality issue and the summary judgment for the city determining that the issue was not an election contest. The court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-1-210(b) (amended 2001) violated Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 9, as the statute enabled only certain territories to incorporate, namely those that held elections before a certain date, and there was no rational basis for the creation of that special class. The court also held that the city's claim was not an election contest, noting that the city had no standing to proceed in an election contest about a referendum involving the town's citizens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of partial summary judgment for the city on the constitutionality of the statute at issue and the order granting the city's motion for summary judgment holding that the action was not an election contest. Costs of appeal were assessed against the town, the mayor, and members of county election commission and their sureties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county filed an action against appellee property owner to enjoin the maintenance of an automobile junkyard within 1,000 feet of a county road pursuant to the authority of 1987 Tenn. Priv. Acts chs. 95, and 97. The owner asserted that the county lacked standing and that the acts were unconstitutional. The Chancery Court for Smith County (Tennessee) sustained both the owner's defenses. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner first argued that the private acts violated Tenn. Const. arts. I, &sect; 8 and 2, &sect; 8, as well as the federal Equal Protection Clause, because they amounted to a suspension of the general law against the inhabitants of the county, and second, that the acts were so vague that they denied due process of law. The appellate court could have construed the private acts harmoniously with the general laws in the case at bar by determining if the statewide laws contemplated the possibility of stricter local regulations, which they did. The statutes applicable statewide provided that nothing in them should have been construed to have affected the provisions of any lawful ordinance, regulation or resolution that were more restrictive. Localities were thus left free under the statewide laws to regulate junkyards and automobile graveyards more rigorously than the state did. The appellate court held that the private acts were effectively county-specific regulations and their less-than-perfect wording presented a problem more of statutory ambiguity, than a case of unconstitutional vagueness. The appellate court also held that the trial court erred in holding at the county lacked standing.</SPAN></P>

It did not appear that the mother was actively looking for a job and there were no prospects on the horizon. The parents failed to maintain contact with one child. There was no proof that the father lived in a residence suitable for raising the children. The father did not remain drug free. There was no proof offered at trial that the conditions would be remedied in the near future. Therefore, the trial court properly terminated the parent's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner department of children's services sought the termination of the parental rights of respondents, the three-year-old child's mother, biological father, and another man who had signed a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity. The Juvenile Court for Putnam County, Tennessee, terminated the parental rights of the mother and the biological father, but not of the other man. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court based its ruling on a narrow reading of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 24-7-113, to allow the other man to retain the parental status he had obtained as a result of his voluntary acknowledgement of paternity. On review, the department argued that such a narrow reading of the statute violated public policy. The appellate court agreed, finding that by limiting paternity challenges to the signatories to a voluntary acknowledgment, the trial court's decision would make that status virtually unassailable. This was an inappropriate construction of &sect; 24-7-113 as it would defeat the clear intent of the paternity statutes. Contrary to the other man's argument, the evidence showed that fraud was involved in the execution of the voluntary acknowledgement of paternity. His attempt to circumvent the adoption statutes by using the voluntary acknowledgement also violated public policy. The mother failed to raise any constitutional questions at the termination hearing; the appellate court ruled that a finding of severe child abuse against any child created an obvious presumption of parental unfitness, and the incorporation of this presumption into statutory law was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The termination of the parental rights of the mother and the biological father was affirmed. The order of the trial court in regard to the parental rights of the other man was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, proprietress of a bed and breakfast (innkeeper), filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of 1986 Tenn. Priv. Acts 127, a hotel/motel privilege tax. The Chancery Court for Greene County (Tennessee) granted appellee county's summary judgment as to the claim, finding that the innkeeper was not the taxpayer under the act and, consequently, did not have standing to pursue her claim. The innkeeper appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The innkeeper pointed out that she was the taxpayer with respect to &quot;business taxes,&quot; pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-701, et seq., and &quot;sales taxes,&quot; pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-6- 101, et seq. She argued that it made no sense for her to have been the taxpayer on the &quot;breakfast&quot; revenue but not as to the &quot;bed&quot; portion of her income. Under the definition of &quot;taxpayer&quot; in 1986 Tenn. Priv. Acts 127, it was clear that the innkeeper was not the taxpayer. The Act imposed an obligation on an innkeeper to collect and remit the tax. The Act did not designate the operator as the taxpayer. Rather, the innkeeper was merely an agent for the purpose of collecting the tax from her guests. The money damages the innkeeper sought were not hers to claim. As she was not required to pay any taxes, any reimbursement to her would be a windfall to which she was not entitled. The Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Knoxville declined to &quot;broaden&quot; Tennessee's definition of standing just because of a possibility that an innkeeper might be required to remit a charged, but uncollected tax. The appellate court held that the innkeeper lacked standing to have sought the relief set forth in her complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the chancery court was affirmed. The costs on appeal were taxed to the innkeeper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee father pled guilty to and was imprisoned for especially aggravated robbery, committed prior to the birth of the parties' son. Appellant mother subsequently filed a petition to terminate the father's parental rights. The Chancery Court for Williamson County (Tennessee) declined to do so, because the evidence that the child would have been substantially harmed if the father kept his parental rights was insufficient. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the statutory ground for terminating parental rights had been met. On appeal, the appellate court had to address the issue of whether, once grounds for termination had been established, the trial court was required to have made a separate finding of substantial harm. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(c) did not on its face require such a separate finding; the statute required a finding by clear and convincing evidence that grounds for termination existed, and that termination of the parental rights was in the child's best interest. The issue was whether the Tennessee Constitution required an additional finding of substantial harm as it pertained to the termination of parental rights based on &sect; 36-1-113(g)(6) regarding a parent's incarceration. The Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Nashville, concluded that, where grounds were established pursuant to &sect; 36-1-113(g)(6), regarding incarceration of a parent, a separate finding of substantial harm was not constitutionally required. The trial court clearly required the mother to have established substantial harm, beyond meeting the requirements of the termination statute. An erroneous legal standard was applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An erroneous legal standard had been applied, and the case was reversed and remanded for the trial court to make a determination of the child's &quot;best interests&quot; in light of the correct legal standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-employee was arrested for child sexual abuse and brought an action against appellees, the church he once worked for, as well as against the department of children's services and other governmental agencies. He claimed that his arrest was procured by illegal or unconstitutional means. The Circuit Court for Warren County (Tennessee) dismissed the action for, inter alia, failure to state a claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-employee listed 17 issues for review, most of which had nothing to do with the grounds upon which his pleading was dismissed. However, he did state that the statute of limitations should not have applied to him, as the county jail had not provided adequate resources for prisoners to do legal research and that the governmental defendants were not immune, as they were also sued in their individual capacities and for acting under color of state law. The appellate court found neither of those arguments persuasive. Tenn. R. Civ. P. 8.01 stated that the pleading required to initiate a civil suit had to contain, inter alia, a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader was entitled to relief. Neither the ex-employee's initial motion nor his subsequent filings were sufficiently coherent to satisfy the simplified requirements. Instead, they asserted a welter of allegations and grievances against a large number of people, some of whom were named as defendants and some not. Most of the allegations were so lacking in sufficient particulars that it was difficult to determine what conduct each individual was alleged to have been guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that the Declaratory Judgment Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-14-101 et seq., did not permit the filing of a suit against the state to construe statutes. The chancery court lacked the jurisdiction to hear a declaratory judgment action against the Department of Correction. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-5-223 and 4-5-225 did not apply to the internal management of state government if the policy did not affect the private rights, privileges, or procedures available to the public. The chancellor held that the policy fell into that category, and on appeal the court agreed. The inmate did not allege that he was presently affected by the policy. He only alleged that he feared he might become subject to discipline sometime in the future if he was unable to give a urine sample.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the chancellor, remanded the cause to chancery for any further necessary proceedings, and taxed the costs on appeal to the inmate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, dismissed appellant citizen's complaint against appellees, Tennessee governor and others, alleging that appellees were guilty of kidnapping, extortion, and racketeering through the application of laws calling for mandatory car insurance, and the practice of routine car stops. The citizen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen argued that the trial court erred in finding that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for production and for exigency writ. The appellate court found that the trial court did not err in denying the citizen's request for production as the discovery was unduly burdensome or expensive. Denying the citizen's request for injunctive relief was proper as there was little chance that the citizen's complaint could succeed on the merits, there was no threat of irreparable harm to the citizen, and public interest and interest-balancing considerations weighed in favor of appellees. Granting the citizen the relief he sought would bring law enforcement and all branches of state government to a halt in Tennessee. The citizen failed to demonstrate that appellees, through any of the alleged wrongs, caused the citizen a distinct and palpable injury, or that application of the Tennessee Financial Responsibility Act, which the citizen claimed was unconstitutional, had injuriously affected him. As such, the citizen lacked standing as to all claims presented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trash haulers filed suit against defendant city, challenging the legality of certain fees. The suit was consolidated with the city's action against the trash haulers for collection of the unpaid fees. The Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, entered summary judgment for the city. The trash haulers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter involved a dispute over tipping fees, which were fees on waste deliveries to a disposal facility that were assessed by the city against trash haulers. On appeal, the following issues were presented: (1) whether the tipping fee constituted double taxation; (2) whether the tipping fee violated equal protection rights; (3) whether the tipping fee was a flow control mechanism; and (4) whether the tipping fee was an unlawful restraint of trade. While the trash haulers suffered financial loss, the customers, not the haulers, bore the ultimate brunt of shouldering these costs. The tipping fees were fees, not taxes. The equal protection argument hinged on the theory that non-uniform fees were imposed in a single class. Under the circumstances, the trash haulers' equal protection rights were not violated. Moreover, there was a rational basis to justify these fees. The tipping fees also did not constitute an illegal flow control device. The tipping fees were not designed to force haulers in the area to strictly and exclusively dispose of collected waste at a certain facility. Finally, the city was authorized to impose and collect tipping fees upon the disposal of solid waste.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tennessee Department of Health/Health Facilities Commission (HFC) filed a petition to hold defendant owners in civil contempt for operating a clinic that performed a substantial number of abortions without a certificate of need from HFC and a license from the department. The Chancery Court of Davidson County (Tennessee) held the owners in contempt and enjoined the clinic from operating without a certificate and a license. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clinic owners asserted that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 68-11-201(3) requiring a doctor's office to obtain a certificate of need and a license to operate if a &quot;substantial number&quot; of abortions were performed in the office did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of due process under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 68- 11-213(b)(2) made the operation of an ambulatory surgical treatment center (ASTC) without a license a crime. The appellate court believed that the owners had standing to challenge the statute on the vagueness ground. The appellate court found the statute was unconstitutional because it failed to give fair notice of what it required and because it encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. To the extent that there was any basis for distinguishing between a doctor who occasionally performed an abortion in his office and one whose practice was primarily devoted to such procedures, the regulations appeared to run contrary to sound health policy. The appellate court concluded that the statute adversely impacted a constitutionally protected right to privacy without a compelling State reason to justify it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment, dismissed the contempt charge, declared the statute requiring the clinic owners to obtain a certificate of need and a license unconstitutional, and remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mineral companies filed a lawsuit in the Chancery Court for Decatur County, Tennessee, challenging the constitutionality of a mineral severance tax increase assessed by appellee county.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general assembly enacted a public act authorizing counties to collect a mineral severance tax provided the funds were deposited in the county road fund. Later, the general assembly passed another private act allowing the county to allocate the revenue from the tax to the county's general fund and to increase the tax. The mineral companies unsuccessfully opposed the tax increase, arguing the tax was unconstitutional because the funds were being deposited into the county general fund rather than into the county road fund. The county argued the mineral companies were estopped from challenging the increase because they did not make payment under protest. The appellate court initially noted in a suit to recover taxes paid after January 1, 1986, payment of the tax under protest was not a condition precedent to a claim against the governmental entity imposing the tax. The appellate court held the tax increase bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest, did not discriminate in the manner in which it was collected, and was properly applied to the general fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part; however, the portion of the judgment holding the mineral companies were not required to pay the tax in protest, that they did not have standing to sue, and were estopped from contesting the constitutionality of the tax was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother married the father. At the time, the mother had one daughter, whom the father adopted. The second daughter was later born. About five years after the parents married, the mother left the father and her children. The parents were divorced two years later. The mother had not seen the children since she left the father. The mother pleaded guilty to statutory rape of two boys. The father was later found to have sexually abused the two girls. The State successfully had the mother's parental rights terminated because she abused the girls as well as abandoned them. The court of appeals held that the mother willfully abandoned her two daughters. The two girls had severe emotional problems because of the abandonment, as well as because of their father's sexual abuse. The best interests of the children rested with their aunt and uncle, who desired to adopt the two girls. The trial court did not err by finding that the mother had abandoned her children and by terminating the mother's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner challenged a judgment of the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), dismissing his petition for judicial review of an extension, after his release eligibility date was extended by 30 percent after he assaulted a correctional employee of appellee Tennessee Department of Correction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of burglary and grand larceny in 1985, smuggling of contraband in 1986, and felony escape in 1990. He received separate sentences of imprisonment for each offense. He came before the prison disciplinary board for assault on a staff member, and was convicted of the violation. As a consequence, the release eligibility date on all his offenses was extended 30 percent. On appeal, the prisoner argued that the extension amounted to an unconstitutional violation of the ex post facto prohibition, double jeopardy, and separation of powers. The appellate court initially held that the prisoner was not entitled to relief, because his petition was untimely and there was nothing indicating that the prisoner first petitioned the department for a declaratory judgment. The appellate court addressed the constitutional claims and held that there was no ex post facto violation; there was no jeopardy violation, because the disciplinary proceeding was administrative in nature and did not conflict with criminal court proceedings; and the separation of powers issue was without merit, as the sentence change was within the parameters of statutory law and the executive power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the inmate was a prisoner under Tennessee statutes. The inmate failed to allege all the elements of a prima facie claim of retaliation. The inmate failed to detail how his transfer to an Oklahoma prison in any way prevented or discouraged him from exercising his right to petition the court for redress of grievances. As such, the inmate could not show a casual connection between his transfer and his inability to freely access the courts. The inmate also failed to state claim that alleged he was entitled to certain procedural safeguards before the company could transfer him to another prison. The inmate failed to allege any atypical or significant hardship. Transfers to other prisons and administrative segregation did not constitute atypical or significant hardships in and of themselves. The inmate was not prejudiced by the trial court clerk's failure to insure that his response to the motion to dismiss was before the judge as the inmate did not raise the issue at the trial level, and such error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first issue was whether the trial court erred by terminating the father's parental rights on the basis of willful abandonment under &sect; 36-1-102(1)(A)(i). The chancery court found that the father willfully abandoned his child in that he willfully failed to visit and willfully failed to support her during the four months immediately preceding the filing of the county's petition to terminate parental rights in the juvenile court. The father argued that the chancery court erred by looking to the four months immediately preceding the filing of the petition to terminate parental rights in the juvenile court rather than the four months immediately preceding the filing of the foster parent's petition to terminate parental rights in the chancery court. The appellate court held that the relevant four month period was the four months immediately preceding the filing of the county's petition to terminate parental rights in the juvenile court. The father failed to contact DCS to request visitation until six months following the filing of the county's petition. He never paid support until five months following the filing of that petition.

As they were leaving, defendant made statements and gestures to the school supervisor that he considered threatening. The appellate court found that defendant's statements were not mere epithets or insults, but were threatening and made the school supervisor feel apprehensive. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of disorderly conduct pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-305(a)(1) (1997). In the courtroom, the judge ordered defendant to sit on the benches. When defendant refused to comply, the judge ordered an officer to take defendant out of the courtroom and place him into a holding cell. Defendant reacted violently and struck the officer. Eventually, five officers subdued defendant. As a result of defendant's altercation with the five officers, the jury convicted him of assault and resisting arrest. Because the juvenile court had the right to prevent disturbances in the courtroom and it did not act arbitrarily in ordering defendant to sit on the benches, the jury's decision finding defendant guilty of assault and resisting arrest for his altercation with the officers was proper.</SPAN></P>

His complaint alleged the failure of certain employees to honor his doctor's direction that he was to be housed on a lower floor and assigned to a lower bunk following back surgery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner had to show that the prison employees were aware of, but chose to disregard, a substantial risk of serious harm to him. The appellate court found there were simply no facts, or reasonable inferences, suggesting that the conduct of any of the employees was tantamount to an intent to punish. While there was a dispute in the record as to who knew of the prisoner's medical restrictions and when they knew of them, the appellate court agreed with the trial court that the prisoner failed to assert facts that would support his claim for relief. The appellate court also agreed with the trial court that two of the defendants were not charged with any specific acts of misconduct; rather they were sued because of their supervisory responsibilities. The appellate court noted that liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 had to have been based on more than the right to control employees. The prisoner's claim was for negligence or, at most, gross negligence. The appellate court stated this was simply not enough to state a claim for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs to be actionable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into an oral contract regarding towing and storage services for vehicles seized by the department. The parties disputed many of the terms of the contract, including how much the owner's business was to be paid for towing and storage and when the department was required to hold a sale of the seized vehicles. Over a two-year period, the owner's business towed and stored about 80 vehicles for the sheriff. The department never held a sale of any of the vehicles and did not begin removing the vehicles until after the instant complaint was filed. The appeals court held the evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that the parties agreed upon a fee of $ 45-$ 65 per vehicle for towing and storage until the vehicles could be sold. The sheriff's performance of his duty, under the oral contract, to sell the seized vehicles was not due until he determined he had enough vehicles to justify holding a sale. This was the procedure used by state agencies in the sale of seized vehicles. The owner was not entitled to recovery of storage fees under a quantum meruit theory since the parties had an enforceable contract which covered the same subject matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Hawkins County (Tennessee) ordered that appellee grandparents be allowed visitation with their granddaughter every two weeks as recommended by a psychologist. Both the child and appellant father had lived with the grandparents the first two year of the child's life and the grandparents had been highly involved in raising the child. The father appealed on statutory grounds and on grounds of the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the father first raised the issue of whether the petition for grandparent visitation should have been dismissed because it was filed under a prior version of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-6-306 (1997) with certain language regarding the &quot;best interest of the child&quot; standard that had been declared unconstitutional. However, the appellate court held the doctrine of elision allowed the trial court to elide the unconstitutional portion of a statute and find the remaining provisions to be constitutional and effective. The father was against grandparent visitation because he alleged they did not support his own relationship with his daughter and because he feared a cousin posed a threat to his daughter. However, the trial court had found that the child had a significant existing relationship with the grandparents for five years, they being pretty much the child's primary parents and that there was a danger of substantial harm to the child if she was not to have visitation with her grandparents. The appellate court concluded the trial court properly evaluated all the evidence in making it's decision and found that the limited visitation ordered was sufficient to avoid substantial harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed and the case was remanded, with the cost assessed one-half to the grandparents and one-half to the father.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Sevier County (Tennessee) increased the child support. The circuit court denied the motion for a new trial filed by appellant, the father, overruled the mother's motion for summary judgment, found the father was in civil contempt, denied the mother's petition for attorney's fees, and dismissed her second petition for contempt. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed for a divorce from the father. They had one daughter. The trial court ordered the father to pay child support. At the time of the divorce, the father had custody of a minor son by a previous marriage, along with an obligation to child support. The parties remarried. The father had another child. The mother sought to modify child support based on a change of circumstances. Inter alia, the trial court ordered modification of the child support, overruled the mother's motion for summary judgment, and decreased the amount of money the father had to put into a trust fund. The court of appeals held: (1) there was no abuse of discretion in granting certain continuances; (2) the issue involving the scheduling of the mother's hearings was moot; (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to find the father in contempt in various instances and by refusing to award the mother attorney fees; (4) it was harmless error to examine certain financial records; (5) the change in custody issue was not a proper subject for resolution by summary judgment; and (6) Tenn. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. 1240-2-4-.03(4) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed in part as to the finding that the regulation in question was constitutional, and the judgment was vacated as to child support.

The mother's motions to admit post judgment facts and to dismiss due to unclean hands were denied.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the warden was a proper party to the suit. One of the inmate's claims was that he appealed the denial of three days credit for pre-hearing segregation to the warden, who denied him relief. The disciplinary board was a proper defendant because it was the proper board or commission whose decision was being challenged. Although the inmate alleged he was coerced into pleading guilty, he did not deny he engaged in a fight with another inmate. He willingly entered the guilty plea to the lesser offense. No particular punishment was part of the inmate's inducement to plead guilty. The inmate did not allege he was treated more harshly than others because he was a member of a suspect class. Exercise of discretion in punishment in relation to the seriousness of the offense was reasonably related to penological interests. The inmate failed to state a claim for denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was involved in an automobile accident when his car was struck by the employee, acting in the course and scope of her employment.

Code Ann. &sect; 16-1-116 should be applied to allow the transfer to circuit court, thereby saving his lawsuit from the statute of limitations; and that the Tennessee Constitution prevented dismissal of his complaint. The appellate court initially noted that the filing of the complaint in general sessions court did not toll the statute of limitations, and the &quot;removal&quot; was unauthorized. Additionally, the appellate court held that &sect; 16-1-116 could not be applied retroactively, because it would impair the entity's vested right in its statute of limitations defense; the constitutional provision allowing citizens of the most populous county or counties to bring qualifying GTLA actions in general sessions courts had a rational basis; and the case was distinguished from the Flowers case, which tolled the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

The father was removed from the home, and he ultimately pled guilty to child abuse. The trial court was concerned about DCS' inability to locate the father, and his failure to satisfactorily address the issue of his prior child abuse, or follow counseling recommendations. On appeal, the father maintained that there was failure to show sufficient proof establishing willful and deliberate abandonment of his minor child. The appellate court concluded the totality of the circumstances supported the determination the father abandoned the child by clear and convincing evidence. Moreover, the facts were sufficient to support a finding that the placement of the child with the father posed a risk of substantial harm to the child. The termination of the father's parental rights was in the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that senior correctional officers took him into custody and placed him in segregation as the result of an altercation that occurred between two prisoners. The inmate was served with a disciplinary report in which he was charged with conspiracy to violate state law. The report alleged that the inmate had hired one of the prisoners to assault the other prisoner. On appeal, the inmate alleged that his placement in administrative segregation for an undetermined period of time constituted an atypical and significant hardship and, therefore, implicated a liberty interest which required the protections of due process. The inmate explained that, while he was being held in administrative segregation, he was classified a maximum custody inmate. The appellate court did not agree that this inability to obtain certification for a parole hearing constitutes a liberty interest which requires due process protections. Since Tennessee recognized no constitutional right to early release, the inmate could not show that he suffered a deprivation of a liberty interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In August 1999, the mother left her child with an acquaintance before she was jailed. The acquaintance did not believe the mother wanted the child back, so the child was placed in foster care. The agency moved to terminate the mother's rights in November 2000. The appellate court held that clear and convincing evidence existed to show that the mother failed to substantially comply with the responsibilities set forth in a plan of care. For more than 18 months after the plan went into effect, the mother continued to live in a motel and did not obtain suitable housing until approximately 2 months before the termination proceeding. As of the date of the hearing, the mother had yet to attend her first parenting class, and she had attended only a few counseling sessions. There was no proof that the mother had located any appropriate and responsible providers to care for the child when she was away, and by her own testimony, she paid no monetary support during the entire time her child was in the agency's custody even though she was employed for a majority of that time. The mother's argument that she did not pay support as she was not under an order to do so did not benefit her claim.</SPAN></P>

On review, the appellate court found no error in the trial court's conclusion that termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interests.  Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(i).

On remand, the Probate Court for Sumner County (Tennessee) determined that the changing fraction method to calculate the surviving spouse's elective share of the estate did not apply. The surviving spouse appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died in June 1993. The surviving spouse filed a petition for an elective share of the decedent's estate in December 1993. A dispute subsequently arose among the parties regarding the proper calculation for the surviving spouse's elective share. The appellate court determined that the &quot;fixed fraction&quot; method was the proper method of calculation of the surviving spouse's elective share. After the court made that decision, the legislature amended the Uniform Principal and Income Act. In response to that amendment, the executors moved the court to determine whether the fixed fraction method or the changing fraction method should be used. The appellate court held that the plain language of the amendment indicated that it was to apply to any existing estate or trust as of July 1, 2000. As the court noted, it was not reasonable to assume that the legislature intended that the amendment operate retroactively to necessitate the recalculation of prior years distributions of income. Thus, the fixed fraction method applied to income received prior to July 1, 2000, and the changing fraction applied to income after July 1, 2000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the application of the fixed fraction method to income received before July 1, 2000, and reversed it to income received after July 1, 2000.</SPAN></P>

The mother was granted sole custody of their two children, and the father was granted supervised visitation. The issue of child support was reserved for the future, as the father was not working at the time of the divorce. The mother married the step-father in 1997. The mother and step-father sought to terminate the father's parental rights so the step-father could adopt the children. The mother and step-father claimed the father abandoned the children by willfully failing to pay child support and by willfully failing to visit the children. The appellate court affirmed the lower court's ruling that the father had not abandoned his children. The court held that, while the father's visits were irregular, the mother did little to accommodate the father's efforts to establish visitation. The court also found that, while the father could be criticized for failing to provide support, there was no order for him to do so, and the mother clearly indicated to the father that she did not want to receive support. The mother and step-father failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that the father abandoned the children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner sued appellees, Tennessee Department of Correction (TDOC), its commissioner, the prison warden and employees for the destruction of his photos, claiming their actions amounted to an unconstitutional deprivation of his rights. The Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) dismissed the suit, ruling it was a negligence claim and that the only forum available was the Tennessee Claims Commission. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission furnished a remedy for injuries caused by the negligence of state employees who were acting in their official capacities. The only proper defendant in such an action was the State.  42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 furnished a remedy for malicious or intentional actions by State employees acting under color of law, which resulted in a deprivation of constitutional rights. The only proper defendants in this type of action were the individuals. The appropriate procedure was to hold the court proceedings in abeyance until the commission could determine whether the prisoner's claim fell within its charter. If the commission determined that the destruction of the prisoner's albums was a negligent act, arising from the scope of employment of the named individuals, then the waiver provision of Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 9-8-307(b) came into play, and the civil rights claim could be dismissed. Finally, the TDOC was not a &quot;person&quot; within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and the prisoner was not challenging the TDOC Commissioner's policy, but rather the misuse of the policy by others. Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed the claims against those two parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's dismissal of the prisoners claims against the department and the commissioner was affirmed. The dismissal of the prisoner's claims against the prison warden, the assistant commissioner as well as two prison officials who destroyed the photos was reversed. The order dismissing the civil rights claims against the latter two prison officials, the assistant warden and assistant commissioner was reversed. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an operator of a whitewater rafting business, contended evidence presented at trial in the Chancery Court for Polk County (Tennessee) showed that classification of whitewater rafting businesses and their customers under a private act applicable to appellee county was without reasonable basis, and that the trial court's finding to the contrary was in error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county classified whitewater rafting businesses and their customers under a private act (the Act), assessing a privilege tax on the business. The appellate court reversed the taxes, but remanded for the trial court's determination as to whether a reasonable basis existed for the classification of the business under the Act. On remand, the trial court found a reasonable basis existed and reinstated the tax. On appeal, the rafting company argued the Act violated the Tennessee Constitution, as it was contrary to the general law of Tennessee, without a reasonable basis. The appellate court noted that the county's resources supported a population of less than 15,000; but for 116 days each year, these resources had to be used, in cooperation with state and federal services, to oversee and control an estimated one million tourists. The tax was equally applicable to all within the class, county commercial rafting companies and their customers engaging in the sale or purchase of rafting tickets. The appellate court found the classification under the Act was rational, not arbitrary, and found a direct, natural, and acceptable relation between the classification and the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review of an administrative child support decision of the Tennessee Department of Human Services, the Juvenile Court, Haywood County (Tennessee), transferred the case, but also decided it on the merits, ruling appellee state's action contravened Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-905 regarding seizure of appellant obligor's assets, and the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state petitioned to establish paternity of two children. Paternity was established. Hearings were held to determine the father's child support obligations. A retroactive child support obligation was ordered, to begin in seven days. The state sought to collect it, starting the day the judgment issued, by issuing the father's employer an administrative order for the seizure of assets, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-905. Two days later, the state notified him his pension was to be seized to satisfy the retroactive support. He appealed to the juvenile court, which ruled the seizure impermissible but disavowed jurisdiction, having erroneously concluded a conflict existed between Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-322 and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-1003. The state conceded it failed to comply with the statutory guidelines in seizing the father's assets before any payment was due. The instant court concluded that, pursuant to &sect; 36-5-1003, these administrative appeals related to child support orders issued by the department of human services and were properly before the juvenile court pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-1001.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals reversed the decision of the juvenile court regarding its lack of jurisdiction to review the department human services' administrative ruling, as well as its decision to transfer the matter to chancery court. Further, it reversed the ruling on the constitutionality of the statute. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject children were placed in the home of the former foster parents, who had adopted their half-siblings.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-1-117(a)(1) and (d) listed the necessary parties to an adoption proceeding and those entitled to notice, and former foster parents were not included. Therefore, the former foster parents were not entitled to notice of the foster parents' adoption petition. When the foster parents filed their adoption petition, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-116(f)(2) suspended the former foster parents' pending custody matter, and the chancery court had exclusive jurisdiction of all matters pertaining to the children under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-116(f)(1). As a result, the chancery court was not required to decide the custody petition before it ruled on the foster parents' summary judgment motion filed in the adoption case. It was unnecessary to decide the former foster parents' challenge to the constitutionality of Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Chancery Court for Roane County (Tennessee) judgment upheld defendant county board of commissioners' refusal to rezone plaintiff landowners' property from A-1 General Agricultural to a newly created A-2 zoning district intended for application in rural areas for the keeping of Class I exotic animals and enjoined the landowners from using their rural property to house exotic animals except for their pet tiger. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal dispositive issue decided by the appeals court was whether the county's refusal to rezone the landowners' property from A-1 to A-2 was arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory. Soon after acquiring the property, the landowners informed the county that they intended to house a tiger thereon, a non-conforming use permitted in the A-1 zone pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-7-208. The county responded by adopting a resolution amending the regional zoning ordinance to create the A-2 zone. The county then rezoned another person's property, originally approved for exotic animals, from A-1 to A-2. The landowners' A-1 property was more qualified than the other person's property for A-2 designation. The amendment could not abrogate permitted A-1 uses and limit uses to a different class of animals such as dogs and cats. There was no reasonable basis for the obvious discriminatory action of the county in rezoning the likely unqualified other property, while refusing to rezone the landowners' clearly qualified property. The appeals court upheld the zoning amendment as not vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court reversed the judgment, in part, to dissolve the injunction against the landowners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court reserved the mother's contempt for a later hearing, at which it initially refused to hear evidence on that subject. The appellate court held this error was made harmless when the trial court amended its decision and allowed such proof. If the trial court's refusal to allow the father to fire his attorney and proceed pro se was error, it was harmless because it did not affect the judgment or prejudice the judicial process. The evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that the father did not show a material change in the child's circumstances to support his motion to modify custody. The father's status as joint legal custodian had no bearing on his child support obligation, as he did not have primary physical custody, so his child support obligation was correctly raised, based on increased income. The trial court's order finding the father's failure to pay child support was willful implied that it found the father was able to pay the support ordered when due, and sufficiently supported its finding that the father was in contempt. The trial court's credibility determination that the mother was not in contempt was not disturbed.</SPAN></P>

The Chancery Court for Anderson County (Tennessee) granted summary judgment to the taxpayer, holding that the subject software fell within an exemption. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer had a contract with the United States Department of Energy and carried out the fabrication of nuclear weapons components.

Code Ann. &sect; 67-6-102(25)(B) (1998), which provided that the fabrication of software by a person for such person's own use or consumption was not considered a taxable &quot;use.&quot; The facts of the case implicated several provisions of the Retailers' Sales Tax Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-6-101 et seq. The question before the appellate court was whether the general assembly intended to exempt computer software made by the user, but continue taxation of its sale or use otherwise, and whether the software was fabricated for the taxpayer's own use or consumption so as to be exempt from the use tax. The appellate court held the taxpayer was both the fabricator and the user of the subject software. It did not fabricate the software for sale to another, nor did it fabricate it for the use of another, either of which events would have rendered the exemption inapplicable. Therefore, the exemption under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-6-102(25)(B) (1998) applied.</SPAN></P>

The mother and State of Tennessee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that Tenn. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. 1240-2-4-.03(4) violated the Equal Protection Clause contained in U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The juvenile judge found that the provision of Tennessee's child support guidelines, Tenn. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. 1240-2-4-.02(2)(b), violated the Equal Protection Clause, as well as the Due Process Clause and the separation of powers provision of the Tennessee Constitution. The appellate court found that there was no legitimate state purposes in requiring a parent to allocate his or her income more to one child than another. The State's attempt to do so was unconstitutional. The appellate court found it was appropriate to remand the case to hear additional proof as to the father's net income, as the figures for the father's income showed that he had considerably more income in the two preceding years. The appropriate method to determine the child's award would be to determine the appropriate amount under the guidelines for three children, deduct that amount from the father's net monthly income, and make an award to the child applying the guideline percent for one child.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the instant court found that (1) it lacked authority to abolish the doctrine of sovereign immunity; (2) the GTLA's cap on damages did not violate the Tennessee Constitution; (3) the trial court did not err in subjecting the loss of consortium claim to the GTLA's statutory limits; (4) the trial court did not err in refusing to grant summary judgment to the county based on discretionary function immunity; (5) the evidence was sufficient to sustain the survivor son's claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress; (6) the trial court did not err by refusing to grant the county's directed verdict motion with respect to the wrongful death claim; (7) the verdicts were not excessive; (8) the trial court did not abuse its discretion concerning counsel's arguments; and (8) discretionary costs were not awardable above the statutory cap.</SPAN></P>

The realtors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three ordinances were adopted by the city annexing property in three separate locations. Each of the realtors owned property in one of the areas annexed, and they filed suit contending the annexation of the areas violated state law. Three years after the three original ordinances were adopted by the city, and after the suit was filed, the city amended the ordinances to exclude the properties owned by the realtors from the area annexed. In response to the city's amendments, three additional landowners, whose property was within the original annexation ordinance, moved to be permitted to intervene. The realtors appealed the dismissal of their suit, insisting their right to contest the annexation was not precluded by excluding their property from the ordinances repealing the earlier ones. The appeals court disagreed, finding counsel for the realtors conceded in oral argument that had the initial ordinances not included their property they would have had no standing to contest. As to the parties seeking to intervene, they failed to perfect an appeal by not filing a notice of appeal.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that (1) the mother's last minute efforts to attempt to comply with the plan's requirements and remain drug free did not form the basis for a conclusion that the DCS did not meet its burden of proof; (2) the mother's willful abandonment of the children by not paying child support, and her failure to maintain regular visitation with them, established that it was in the best interest of the children to terminate the mother's parental rights; and (3) because the evidence was clear that the DCS made reasonable efforts to assist the mother in establishing a suitable home for the children, a re-evaluation of the trial court's assessment of the DCS witness was not required.</SPAN></P>

Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(g) provided that a termination of parental rights could be based upon the ground of abandonment pursuant to &sect; 36-1-113(g)(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver had her license revoked for one year for driving while intoxicated (DUI). She was eligible to have her license reinstated, but had failed to do so, when she was stopped for a traffic violation. The trial court held that forfeiture of her van under &sect; 55-50-504(h) violated the Excessive Fines Clauses of the United States and Tennessee Constitutions. The appellate court agreed. It ruled that the driver's van was subject to forfeiture under &sect; 55-50-504(h), even though she had been eligible for reinstatement. It then conducted an &quot;excessive fines&quot; proportionality analysis in which it considered both the gravity of the offense and the culpability of the driver's conduct. The maximum punishment for driving when one's license had been revoked for a DUI offense was six months in jail, and a $ 1,000 fine, indicating a minimal level of culpability for this offense. The driver was neither violent nor dangerous to the public. Her failure to take the steps necessary to have her license reissued was not especially reprehensible and caused minimal harm to the department. The forfeiture was held to be an unconstitutionally excessive fine on the facts of the instant case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen sought documents relating to lease negotiations between the authority and a third party and correspondence to and from the authority's privately retained attorney relating to the project. The trial court ordered disclosure of most of the documents but reserved ruling on the correspondence until a later date. The court refused to stay its order and the authority released the documents, including proposed leases. The trial court then issued a separate order directing disclosure of the correspondence. That order was stayed pending appeal. The authority argued that the leases and correspondence were exempt from disclosure. The appellate court held that the case was moot as to the leases as they had been released. As to the correspondence, while an attorney had the ethical duty to maintain the confidences and secrets of a client, the mere fact that a public record had been signed or was being held by an attorney did not necessarily exempt the record from disclosure. Disclosure would be prohibited only if the records contained something of a confidential or secret nature.

He alleged that, before he was placed in punitive segregation, prison policy provided him with certain disciplinary procedures, including issuance of a disciplinary report, and the prison failed to follow these procedures in transferring him from protective to punitive segregation.</SPAN></P>

The property owner contended that the city's decision to deny his rezoning application lacked a rational basis; that it was arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful. The appellate court found no abuse of discretion in the city's decision to deny the property owner's rezoning application. The MPC staff advanced cogent reasons for maintaining the residential zone. The MPC and the city council essentially adopted the staff's reasoning. The city's decision upheld the sector plan and its rationale in denying this rezoning request was &quot;fairly debatable,&quot; as it was based upon rational underpinnings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued, inter alia, that Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 40-28-115(c) was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers mandated by the United States and Tennessee constitutions. The court of appeals disagreed because the exercise of a judicial function was not the same as being the recipient of a delegated power that properly belonged to the judicial branch. The inmate argued that his parole eligibility date should not have been governed by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-501, because that statute was enacted after his conviction and sentencing. Instead, he claimed he was entitled to have his parole eligibility date calculated in accordance with the law in effect at the time he was sentenced. The court of appeals found that that the inmate might have been correct, but there was nothing in the record to indicate how his release eligibility date was calculated, including what statute it was based upon, or what the correct date would have been if the calculations had been based upon the earlier law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its request of a temporary injunction, the tavern had argued the city's beer ordinance was unconstitutional and invalid because it was more restrictive in terms of hours of sale than that permitted by the state law for liquor-by-the-drink establishments. The city appealed the chancery court's grant of injunctive relief, arguing the chancery court did not have jurisdiction to enjoin pending or threatened criminal proceedings, or to enjoin the enforcement the city's ordinances as they related to beer sales. The appellate court initially noted a license to sell alcoholic beverages did not confer a property right on the licensee. The appellate court held beer ordinances were expressly prohibitory and penal in nature. The appellate court further held the chancery court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin criminal prosecutions under statute or ordinances, except where property rights were affected. The appellate court concluded the chancery court erred by imposing the injunction prohibiting enforcement of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

He appealed the citations to the Circuit Court for Wilson County, Tennessee, which found that the storage buildings did not violate the principal building zoning provision, and that the seller had not violated the sign ordinance. Appellant city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller was fined for the violation of an ordinance which prohibited certain buildings from being placed on a lot and was also fined for the violation of an ordinance which prohibited signs of certain types in certain areas. He had placed empty storage building with advertisements on the lots. The city maintained that the placement of the storage buildings violated the first ordinance because they were neither the one primary building allowed nor a customary accessory building. Because the storage buildings were not used for storage or for any purpose by the owners of the lots or the businesses on the lots, they were not incidental to the principal uses on the lots and were, therefore, not accessory buildings. The court held that the empty storage buildings which were used for advertising fell within the definition of those buildings which were prohibited by the ordinance. The trial court did not err in concluding that the storage buildings were not portable within the meaning of the sign ordinance. Because the buildings were not accessory buildings and were not easily moveable, they were prohibited by the sign ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the parents never married, after the child's birth, and while they were still dating, the father frequently visited the child and provided some financial support.

The statute was a neutral law of general applicability not aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious convictions. If the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; constitutional analysis was the appropriate test, the statute was the least restrictive means of achieving the compelling state interest of being able to quickly identify drivers. It was also required under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 666(a)(13)(A) (Supp. 2001) that the driver place his social security number on his application. The driver could have sought an exemption from this requirement under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1402(g) (Supp. 2001), but there was no evidence he had satisfied the requirements for such an exemption.

The department entered plans of care for the parents to attempt to regain custody. The father was incarcerated again, confessed to an alcohol problem, was suspected of drug use, but had full-time work when not incarcerated. The mother lived with various people, one whose name she could not recall; was unemployed; stopped taking her own medication; was charged with crimes; and was unaware a restraining order against her visitation with her children had been lifted. The parents threatened and harmed one another physically. One child had an untreated cataract. The appellate court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(g)(2) termination grounds were met.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient injured his ankle when it was caught and twisted between two railroad ties. He was first treated in the prison infirmary by a nurse. He was later treated by the doctor, who was under contract with the prison system to provide health care to inmates. The patient's medical malpractice complaint alleged the doctor's treatment of his ankle was negligent. The basis for the trial court's exclusion of the testimony of the patient's sole medical expert was the failure of the expert to demonstrate knowledge of the standard of care in the community where the doctor practiced. On appeal, the patient argued the exclusion of his sole expert led to the dismissal of the complaint, as it meant he could not meet his burden of proof on the elements of medical malpractice. The appeals court found the patient's expert did not adequately testify as to support a finding that he had the requisite knowledge of the standard of care in the doctor's community and, therefore, his testimony was properly excluded. Testimony that the standard in the doctor's community was the same as the national standard of care was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee husband filed a complaint for divorce in the Chancery Court for Williamson County, Tennessee, and he sought custody of the parties' children. Appellant wife filed a counter-complaint for divorce; she also sought custody of the children. Custody was awarded to the husband, and the wife was denied visitation. Contempt petitions were also filed against both the husband and the wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband's sister and brother-in-law lived across the street from the wife. They used a police-type scanner to intercept the telephone conversations between the wife, her alleged lover, and other friends. Tapes of the conversations were admitted into evidence during cross-examination of the wife for purposes of impeachment. The wife argued that the trial court's ruling on custody and visitation was based largely on the evidence presented from the audio tapes. The appellate court disagreed; there was ample evidence in the record, independent of the tapes, to support the action of the trial judge. Even so, any error was harmless. From the testimony at trial, it was clear that it was in the best interest of the children to be in the custody of the husband, but denying the wife visitation was improper. The husband challenged the trial court's findings of criminal contempt on the grounds that the contempt petition did not provide notice. Apparently, the nature of the contempt did not become known to the parties until the trial court entered its opinion. This provided no opportunity for the contemnor to purge himself.</SPAN></P>

Appellee Tennessee Department of Children's Services developed a plan of care that required the mother to, among other things, remain clean and sober, complete a parenting program, refrain from breaking the law, visit with the children regularly, and maintain a stable household. After her release from prison she attended parenting classes, but was evicted from her apartment, admitted using drugs, and was again incarcerated on drug charges. The appellate court held that abandonment under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(g)(1) (2000) was not a proper basis for termination of the mother's parental rights; the element of intent was lacking because the mother had been incarcerated during the four months preceding the petition. However, termination under &sect; 36-1-113(g)(2) was proper based on the mother's substantial noncompliance with the plan of care, and termination was also proper under &sect; 36-1-113(g)(3)(A) because the mother failed to remedy the conditions that led to the children's removal.</SPAN></P>

The judge's refusal to recuse himself was not an abuse of discretion. No objective person could reasonably question the judge's bias towards counsel for actions which took place several years before while both men were serving as opposing counsel. Counsel did not testify as a witness at an earlier hearing. He was acting merely as an advocate for his client and the only questions that he answered were inquiries of the trial court in that capacity. The trial court had no objective basis to disqualify counsel from acting as the mother's attorney.  Tenn.

The trial court found the financing arrangement to construct the arena to be unconstitutional, and the appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and county created a sports authority, in compliance with the Sports Authorities Act of 1993, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 7-67-101 through -122 (1998 and Supp. 2000). It was proposed that the sports authority issue bonds for the construction of a multiuse arena by the private company, in an effort to attract a National Basketball Association franchise. The city and the county agreed to contribute certain revenues on hand to this effort. The taxpayers complained that this activity violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 29, which greatly limited the ability of a county, city, or town to lend its credit to a private entity. This prohibition did not apply to instrumentalities of the city or county, such as the sports authority. Because the city and county were contributing existing revenue, they were not pledging their credit. The actions of the city and county were permissible under the &quot;public purpose&quot; exception to art. II, &sect; 29, because the sports arena was a public purpose. It was not appropriate for a court to substitute its judgment on this issue for that of a governmental body. The fact that the private company would derive some benefit did not invalidate the public purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment that the taxpayers had standing was affirmed. Otherwise, the trial court's judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The aggrieved individual, without exhausting administrative remedies, could have filed a direct action in chancery or circuit court. Indeed, the employees all filed their discrimination claims directly in the chancery court. The appeals court held that the employees had a right to a jury trial under the Act, because the Act did not expressly exempt that right when creating a civil cause of action for aggrieved persons.

On appeal, he contended that: (1) Tenn. Code.

The appeals court disagreed. The statute authorized attorney's fees to be awarded to the petitioner under certain circumstances, included the instant one, and did not infringe upon to powers of the courts. The child fell under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-3-601(1) and there was no conflict with the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. Third, the rules of civil procedure provided a petition could be brought by a next friend of the minor and the parent or guardian was required to sign the same. Finally, the evidence was sufficient, as the minor's statement about the alleged abuse was a reliable excited utterance and provided proof that the same occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, originally sentenced to death, was ineligible to earn sentence reduction credits, under Tenn.

The vacation of his death sentence did not entitle him to retroactive sentence reduction credits. Under Tenn.

The inmate had once had a &quot;safety valve&quot; release date under the legislation, but the governor cancelled it.

The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed for divorce, and she and the father entered into a marital dissolution agreement that provided for the care and custody of the parties' minor son.

The trial court entered a final divorce decree and incorporated the agreement. The parties soon started to informally alter the visitation. When the mother tried to limit additional visitation, the father became hostile. She petitioned to modify and also alleged she was fearful because the father was continuously carrying a loaded gun. The appellate court modified the trial court's judgment to include a two-week visitation period included in the original dissolution agreement and affirmed the additional Wednesday visitation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother had three minor children.

The family was in the process of being evicted, the water and electricity had been turned off, and there was little means of support. DCS also noted that the mother had a history of drug use and prostitution. The mother received full procedural protection at the termination proceeding. The trial court did err by finding that the mother abandoned the children for failure to visit the children during the four months immediately preceding the filing of the petition to terminate parental rights. The trial court did not err, however, in finding that defendant abandoned the children for failure to pay child support while the children were in state custody. The record clearly demonstrated that the mother failed to substantially comply with a plan of care. Termination of the mother's parental rights was warranted.

The prisoner filed an application for a writ of certiorari in the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee. This court granted the motion to dismiss filed by respondent Tennessee Department of Correction (TDOC), and the prisoner sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was accused of assaulting his cellmate. At a disciplinary hearing conducted by the board, he was allowed to present only one witness, another inmate who testified that the prisoner was attacked first by his cellmate. The instant court found error in the lower court's dismissal of the board and the warden from the action, since both had decision- making authority regarding disciplinary proceedings, and therefore were proper parties. The prisoner's claim that the board acted arbitrarily and illegally, by depriving him of due process, was cognizable under a writ of certiorari. Depriving the prisoner of good time credits implicated an interest sufficient to invoke due process. Dismissal of the prisoner's petition, however, was proper, since he was requesting the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence presented to the board. The board did not violate the prisoner's due process rights by disallowing testimony from an inmate about the victim's prior assaults; that the prisoner failed to stop hitting the cellmate was &quot;some evidence&quot; sufficient to support the finding that he committed assault. His claim that board members were biased was conclusory and unsupported.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When plaintiff was convicted in 1992, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-28-105(d)(3) required only three affirmative votes of the parole board to grant parole. In 1998, the statute was amended to require four affirmative votes for a parole grant for certain crimes, among which were plaintiff's crimes. Plaintiff was denied parole in 1999 by a vote of three affirmative, four negative. His complaint was that the 1998 statute amendment was unconstitutional as applied to him because of ex post facto considerations. As to the merits of the plaintiff's claim that he was entitled to a writ of certiorari because the board reached its decision to deny him parole in an unconstitutional and unlawful manner by violating the ex post facto clause in the Tennessee constitution, the court denied the claim. The amendment did not redefine the offense for parole eligibility nor change the substantive law annexed to the targeted offenses.</SPAN></P>

The Chancery Court for Williamson County (Tennessee), over the Department's objection, added appellees, State Indian Affairs Commission and several Native Americans, as Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 46-4-102 &quot;interested persons,&quot; and appointed attorney general pro tem, outside counsel, for them. State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An area near a road was known to have Native American artifacts. Before beginning road improvements, the Department began an archeological examination, found two unmarked ancient graves, and notified the State Archeologist. The Department petitioned for the graves' relocation under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 46-4-101 to -104 (2000). The trial court granted the Commission's and Native Americans' request to join the suit, and found that the Attorney General had a conflict of interest representing both the Department and the Commission. The appellate court held that, as a matter of law and fact, the Commission lacked capacity to intervene or otherwise participate. Also the Commission had no standing because, as a statutory creature, it had no rights or interests of its own entitled to constitutional protection, neither had it alleged or demonstrated that any of its proprietary interests as a state agency were being jeopardized by the proceeding. The Native Americans did not have veto power over disinterment, nor were they, without proof of blood relationship to the buried person or interest in the realty, &quot;interested persons.&quot; Freedom of religion was not implicated.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded the challenged action was &quot;fairly debatable&quot; and, consequently, dismissed plaintiffs' complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband contended that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-6-101(a)(1) was facially unconstitutional. Because the harm to a child was implicit in a divorce proceeding, parents involved in such a proceeding automatically submitted the issue of custody of a minor child to the court. Accordingly, the husband's argument that &sect; 36-6-101(a)(1) was facially unconstitutional was without merit, and therefore the appellate court declined to address the issue because it was not raised in the trial court. The appellate court found no abuse of discretion (1) in the trial court's suspension of the consent order regarding visitation, (2) in awarding the wife temporary custody and the authority to procure needed medical treatment for the child, (3) in the trial court's division of the marital property, and (4) in awarding the wife's attorney's fees. However, because the child's school schedule changed, on remand the trial court was required to make a determination about the husband's future visitation rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate actions, the State, acting on behalf of two mothers, sought to enforce outstanding child support orders against their children's fathers. Each father was also the subject of at least one other outstanding support order entered after the orders in the present cases. The trial court modified the amount of support and set arrearage amounts to be paid by the fathers, but allowed a credit for the amounts being paid under the later orders. When the State moved to alter or amend the judgments, the trial court made findings of fact that, sua sponte, declared provisions of the Tennessee Child Support Guidelines which prevented the consideration of later support orders in setting the amount of support to be paid to be unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the trial court erred in making such a ruling when the issue had not been raised by any of the parties. The guidelines were not obviously unconstitutional and the court did not consider the issue further. The trial court was directed to make new determinations as to support due and explain any deviation from the support guidelines, as required by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court found that no constitutional infirmity was alleged or proved in the referendum, that a publication of the resolution was in substantial compliance with the statutory requirement, and that there was no evidence that anyone was misled by the publication. The appellate court disagreed with the lower court that plaintiff county had standing to bring its action solely because of its ownership of public roads in the area sought to be annexed; the territory in question was populated, albeit sparsely, as evidenced by the fact that twenty votes were cast, nineteen of which favored annexation. The appellate court also found that defendant town's city hall was the proper polling place, that the area sought to be annexed should have been considered and treated in its entirety, rather than as separate tracts or tax parcels.

The trial court terminated appellant's parental rights because she abandoned the children by failing to pay support for four months, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-102(1)(A)(I), failed to substantially comply with the care plan, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(g)(2), and the children were removed from her home for more than six months and the conditions leading to removal persisted, with little likelihood of being remedied at an early date, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(g)(3). The first ground was unconstitutional, but clear and convincing evidence supported the trial court's finding of the second and third grounds, and termination was in the children's best interests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed because although the statute it applied to find appellant abandoned her children was found unconstitutional, it correctly found appellant's failure to comply with the care plan and persistence of the conditions leading to the children's removal from her home, as well as termination being in the children's best interests.</SPAN></P>

Also, the trial judge ordered the property located on the premises forfeited to the State. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants operated an adult entertainment club. Jackson, Tennessee, Ordinances ch. 3, &sect; 8-301 prohibited nude dancing where alcohol was sold, but defendants chose to ignore the law. The trial court issued a permanent injunction and found that the club constituted a public nuisance because the defendants engaged in the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors and numerous incidents of fighting, public drunkenness, and other breaches of the peace occurred at the club. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the club was a nuisance and that it could properly enjoin defendants from operating an adult entertainment club on the premises. However, the injunction was modified because the trial court could not enjoin defendants from utilizing the premises for a purpose unrelated to the activities which created the nuisance. Additionally, the trial court's order for the forfeiture and public sale of all of the personal property and fixtures seized on the premises was lawful under the nuisance statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that defendants violated the nuisance statute, that the trial court properly enjoined them from operating a business on the premises that would be a public nuisance, and that the trial court properly ordered forfeiture of the property on the premises. The trial court's judgment was reversed in part because defendants could operate a business on the premises as long as it did not constitute a public nuisance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a private investigator and author, retained appellees to locate publishers for works of fiction appellant intended to write. Appellees later sued appellant for breach of contract and unjust enrichment, among other things. They alleged appellant stalked and threatened them, shot or killed their dogs, vandalized their cars, and burglarized their home. After a court granted partial summary judgment to appellant as to the breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims, appellees voluntarily nonsuited the remaining claims. Appellant subsequently filed a complaint alleging malicious prosecution and abuse of process. She delayed service of process until a date after which appellees could no longer refile the dismissed claims. The trial court found appellant and her attorney had improperly withheld service of process and dismissed appellant's claims as barred by the statute of limitations. Judgment was vacated. Appellees' argument that appellant had to see that the summons was issued and served contemporaneously with the filing of the complaint was not in accord with Tennessee law. For statute of limitations purposes, an action still commenced upon filing of a complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was vacated and remanded; the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure did not mandate that appellant's summons be issued to appellees at the same time she filed her complaint.

The appeals court had previously declared the statute unconstitutional as applied to another town. Summary judgment was granted in plaintiffs' favor. Appellant sought review as to whether plaintiffs had standing to bring the action, whether the action was barred by collateral estoppel and by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-17-105, and whether Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-58-108(f)(3) was constitutional. The appeals court affirmed summary judgment. Plaintiffs had standing to bring the action because they were citizens and taxpayers of the town; collateral estoppel was not an issue because neither party had litigated the issues presented; Tenn.

Summary judgment was granted defendants. The appellate court held that plaintiff showed no material fact to indicate he had standing to sue defendant city. Plaintiff made no prior demand to defendant city, and a letter to a state official did not qualify. Defendant county's actions did not constitute an illegal &quot;giving of public credit&quot; under Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 29. Defendants' agreement was legally sufficient under the Industrial Park Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-16-201 et seq.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated rape. He filed an initial petition for certiorari to the trial court, challenging denial by the Board of Paroles (Board) on the grounds that a misrepresentation was made of a psychological examination.

Appellant again sought certiorari, which the court dismissed, granting the Board's motion under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12 (b)(6). From this dismissal, appellant sought review. The appeals court upheld dismissal. The Board was within its discretion in determining that appellant was not a good candidate for release, based on the seriousness of his underlying crime and that paroling him would have a substantially adverse effect on institutional discipline.

The maternal grandparents sought to adopt the child and filed for termination of appellant's and the mother's parental rights, which was granted. The appellate court affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed an order of the Chancery Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) granting defendants summary judgment in their lawsuit challenging the validity a central business improvement district, arguing it was not a valid special assessment, but rather an unlawful tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city council established a Central Business Improvement District (CBID) to improve and assist development of a downtown area. Defendants held a meeting to debate the CBID creation, rate of assessment, method of apportionment, delegation of powers, and stated purposes of defendant center city commission as the district management corporation. The ordinance was approved and assessments were collected. Plaintiffs challenged the validity of the CBID, asserting multifarious error, including it was not a valid special assessment, but rather an unlawful tax. The trial court granted defendants summary judgment and plaintiffs appealed. The court held defendant city had the powers pursuant to the Central Business Improvement District Act of 1990 (Act), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-84-501 et seq. to levy special assessments on all of the property owners in the CBID for the costs and expenses for all improvements within the CBID. The court affirmed, holding the special assessment levied had none of the characteristics of an unlawful tax and was established and valuations calculated within the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because by its annual review of the proposed budget, defendant city council determined the costs and expenses to be paid by the special assessments and thereby complied with local taxing statutes. Further, defendants used a proper assessed value to determine benefits conferred upon each property in the district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, owners of nightclubs, appealed an order of the Chancery Court for Knox County (Tennessee) affirming the constitutionality of an &quot;anti-brown-bagging&quot; ordinance prohibiting customers from bringing and consuming their own alcoholic beverages to a public establishment during certain hours, arguing the ordinance was void for vagueness and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city passed an ordinance prohibiting &quot;brown-bagging,&quot; or allowing patrons to consume their own alcoholic beverages in a public establishment. Plaintiffs, nightclub owners, filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance, arguing it was void for vagueness and overbroad. The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendant. On appeal, the court extensively reviewed the ordinance and noted the test for vagueness was whether a statute was so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. Moreover, the court held the overbreadth doctrine not only prohibited a statute from criminalizing constitutionally protected activity, but could also render a statute unconstitutional, if its sweep had a chilling effect upon constitutionally protected conduct. The court reversed in part, holding the notice provisions imposed on bar owners to notify patrons of when it was unlawful to possess an open container, and requiring that they enforce open displays of alcohol during certain hours failed to consider the bar owner's knowledge or intent and were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed in part, because the notice provisions of the law imposed on bar owners to notify patrons of when it was unlawful to possess an open container was unconstitutionally vague, as well as the term &quot;open display,&quot; which failed to consider the bar owner's knowledge or intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because he was abused by his mother, the child was placed in the custody of the Department of Children's Services, which drafted permanency plans to be met before he could be restored to his mother and father. Alleging that the plans were not complied with, the department filed a petition to terminate mother's and father's parental rights. The petition was granted, and mother and father appealed. The appellate court affirmed. While the elected judge of the county was not an attorney, the person appointed to hear the case was, so mother's and father's rights to have the termination case heard by a licensed attorney were not violated. Neither the Tennessee Constitution nor due process forbade having a nonelected juvenile court referee hear the termination case. Trial testimony showing that neither father nor mother complied with the permanency plan requirements or contributed to the child's support, that father repeatedly abused mother and took no steps to control this behavior, and that mother nonetheless maintained her relationship with father, constituted clear and convincing evidence to support the termination of their parental rights.</SPAN></P>

Respondent father was in and out of jail and respondent mother had bipolar disorder. At a hearing, the juvenile court found that the minor child was dependent and neglected. The child's court appointed special advocate filed a petition for the termination of parental rights pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-1-113(g), 37-2-403(2). These rights were terminated, and the respondents appealed the decision. The decision of the lower court was affirmed. There was clear and convincing evidence to support the decision. The respondents had failed to visit with the minor child once during the four months prior to the hearing and had failed to supply any support to the child. In addition, there was proof that the respondents were unable to cooperate to the degree necessary to raise the minor child. The child's need for a safe and permanent home was more important than the respondents' interests in retaining parental rights.</SPAN></P>

Appellants had sought a declaratory judgment that the new ordinance was invalid as to their property. The lower court determined the statute was valid as to their property. This judgment was reversed. In regards to the instant property, the ordinance amounted to an attempt to take appellants' land without just compensation. The court disagreed with appellee's reading of the state's grandfather statute, finding instead, that the billboards were protected by state law and could not be overturned by a city ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant and his children's mother divorced, she received custody of the marital child they were aware of. She discovered she was pregnant, gave birth to twins, and died. Appellant's legitimation petition in juvenile court, seeking custody of the twins, was granted. He also received custody of the child previously born. The juvenile court's jurisdiction was limited by Tenn. Code Ann. 37-1-103 (Supp. 1998) to 10 types of proceedings, including delinquency, dependency and neglect, and paternity, which all involved the minor person directly. Grandparent visitation petitions were a lawsuit involving the grandparents and the parents of the children. While children were at the heart of that suit, it was the constitutional rights of the parent potentially being affected, rather than those of the children, so &sect; 37-1-103 did not explicitly or by implication give the juvenile court jurisdiction over a grandparent visitation petition independent of its statutory jurisdiction. Once appellant's legitimation petition was finally adjudicated, it was illogical for the juvenile court to maintain jurisdiction over the children who were the subject of that petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was reversed because it did not have jurisdiction over appellees' grandparent visitation petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant husband and appellee wife reached a marital dissolution agreement, they were granted a divorce. Appellee wife filed a Tenn. R. Civ.

Appellant sought review and judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The trial court erred with regard to its interpretation and application of Tenn.

The original divorce decree substantially complied with &sect; 36-4-103 and the parties were both represented by counsel and participated in mediation with a licensed and trained mediator. Consequently, it was an error to vacate the original divorce decree because there was no relevant change of law and no new evidence to indicate any injustice.

On appeal of the judgment for appellee, appellant lacked the financial resources to obtain a verbatim trial transcript, and failed to file a Tenn. R.

Neither of appellant's contentions, that it would have been futile to prepare a statement because the trial court would not have approved it or that the trial court should have prepared an order setting forth the necessary information, warranted excusing appellant from supplying an appellate record. Because none of appellant's alleged errors by the trial court or appellee's counsel were reflected in the technical record, the court affirmed the judgment. Because there was no adequate appellate record, there was never a reasonable chance that the appeal could succeed, and the court held that the appeal was frivolous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After mother died, appellant filed a petition asking for the immediate return of his children, and appellee stepfather filed a petition to terminate appellant's parental rights so the appellee could adopt the children. The trial court found that appellant had abandoned the children. Appellant sought review, and judgment was vacated and remanded because new information, with direct bearing, had surfaced after the trial proceeding. Appellant was willfully underemployed, not financially disabled, and by his own testimony confirmed that he had failed to support the children. Furthermore, the court was unpersuaded by appellant's attempts to convince the court that he was entitled to nurture his second family at the expense of his first. However, recent evidence of an order of the juvenile court found the subject children to be dependent and neglected and the children were placed in the custody of the deceased's father and stepmother. Appellee was only allowed supervised visitation. Consequently, the appellate court was unable to conclude that clear and convincing evidence established that it was in the children's best interest to terminate appellant's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was disciplined for larceny by the prison disciplinary board. Appellant then filed a pro se action for declaratory judgment in the Chancery Court, alleging that the prison's internal grievance procedure was ineffective. He also requested judicial review of the board's action by either declaratory judgment or writ of certiorari. Appellee attorney general responded with a motion to dismiss, asserting that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that appellant failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, which was granted. On appeal, the court affirmed, reasoning that appellant had not alleged how any of his presently existing rights were affected by the operation of the inmate grievance procedure. Further, appellant had not demonstrated how he was harmed by a statute, rule, or order. Thus, dismissal for failure to state a claim was appropriate. The request for certiorari was further dismissed, since it was not timely filed within the statutory 60-day period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed. Complaint failed to articulate viable declaratory judgment claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the default judgment order of the Circuit Court for Knox County (Tennessee), (1) finding Tennessee to be his child's home state, (2) finding California lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the child's custody, (3) domesticating foreign judgments from Ohio and Oklahoma, (4) limiting his visitation, and (5) awarding appellee attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-6-201 et seq.

Acts ch. 389), and 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738A(c)(2)(B) of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, child custody was to be determined in a child's home state. A custody order not from the child's home state was not entitled to full faith and credit. The child's UCCJA home state had personal jurisdiction over the child's parents, without minimum contacts. Venue was proper in the trial court, and appellant was properly served with process. Appellant's argument Tenn. R. Civ. P. 4.05(5), allowing valid process service by registered mail where the addressee refuses delivery, was unconstitutional was not raised below, or was the attorney general notified. The trial court did not abuse discretion by denying appellant's continuance motion, his request to appear telephonically, his motion to set aside the default judgment, or by modifying visitation. Appellant's previous legal action in the state on the same subject matter subjected him to the trial court's personal jurisdiction, allowing it to order him to pay attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was affirmed because its jurisdiction was proper under the UCCJA, it was not required to give full faith and credit to the order of a court which did not have UCCJA jurisdiction, it did not abuse discretion, and it had personal jurisdiction over appellant sufficient to require him to pay attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state legislature appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) which overruled defendants' motion to dismiss an action brought by plaintiffs alleging defendants violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 22, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8- 44-101, et seq., and the due process provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court granted defendants' Tenn. R. App. P. 10 application for permission to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendant state legislature alleging that in deliberating budget and revenue bills toward passage, defendants held sessions that were closed to the public and to the press. Plaintiffs claimed that such secret meetings violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 22, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8- 44-101, et seq., and the due process provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court overruled defendants' motion to dismiss. The court reversed the judgment and entered an order dismissing the complaint. The court reasoned that the Tennessee Open Meetings Act did not apply to defendants, and even if it did, it would not, in the court's opinion, bind a subsequent Tennessee General Assembly. In addition, the decision to hold closed sessions was non-reviewable by the courts because it was a purely political question. Further, a legislator's immunity from suit when performing legislative duties prevented the courts from making defendants justify the decision to hold closed sessions. Finally, the court determined plaintiffs were not deprived of their liberty or property by defendants' actions; therefore, there could be no claim for a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, entered an order dismissing the complaint, and remanded the case for further proceedings because the Tennessee Open Meetings Act did not apply to defendant state legislature. Additionally, the right to liberty did not include the right to attend meetings of governmental bodies; thus, defendants' acts did not deprive plaintiffs of that right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sued appellant to obtain a judgment of paternity and support payments for her minor child. A DNA paternity test established a 99.71 percent probability of paternity. The juvenile court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 24-7-112(b)(2)(B) entitled appellee to a conclusive presumption of paternity. On appeal, that statutory presumption was found to be unconstitutional and the case was remanded to allow appellant an opportunity to rebut the presumption. Appellee subsequently voluntarily non-suited the original paternity action. Several months later, appellee refiled the action. The juvenile court denied appellant's request for a jury trial and found that he was the legal and biological father of appellee's child. Appellant filed an appeal. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that, by virtue of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-2-106(a) (Supp. 1990) (repealed 1997), appellant had at most an accrued statutory right to a jury in the original action, but that statutory right was not a vested right that would survive appellee's non-suit. Therefore, when appellee refiled the action, after &sect; 36-2-106(a) had been repealed, appellant no longer had the right to demand a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Appellant's statutory right to a jury trial was not a vested right; thus, it did not survive appellee's non-suit of the original paternity action and her subsequent refiling of the action after the statute allowing for a jury trial had been repealed. The case was remanded, and costs on appeal were taxed to appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city appealed a judgment of the Hamilton County Criminal Court (Tennessee), which found three statutory provisions and city ordinance unconstitutional and/or invalid and fined appellee $ 50 for violation of a municipal ordinance against reckless driving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, who was cited for reckless driving in violation of an ordinance, appeared in city court, where he pled guilty and was fined $ 300. He appealed to the county trial court, arguing that imposition of a fine exceeding $ 50 violated Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14. Trial court reduced the fine to $ 50, but it also declared the $ 300 fine violated Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14. Trial court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-54-306, 6-54-308, and 55-10-307 were unconstitutional, and it also found Chattanooga, Tenn., Code &sect; 1-8 was invalid. The court upheld the $ 50 fine assessed against appellee, but it also concluded that the trial court erred in finding the statutes and the ordinance unconstitutional and/or invalid. The ordinance was not invalid merely because of the use of the term &quot;punished,&quot; as the penalty imposed by the ordinance was a civil penalty; use of the term &quot;punished&quot; did not alter the civil nature of the penalty imposed. As to the ruling that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-307 denied equal protection, the court concluded that a rational basis existed for the delegation of authority to enforce certain driving offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the judgment assessing a $ 50 fine was affirmed. That portion of the judgment declaring the statutory provisions and the city ordinance unconstitutional was reversed, and the case was remanded for entry of an order consistent with the opinion. Use of the term &quot;punished&quot; in ordinance did not render ordinance invalid, as the penalty imposed by the ordinance was a civil penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Hamilton County (Tennessee) which determined it was in the best interest of the parties' child for custody to be awarded to appellee and found that primary residential custody of the child should be changed to appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee filed a petition to modify seeking the custody of the parties' minor child. The trial court determined that it was in the best interest of the child for custody to be awarded to appellee. On appeal, appellant argued the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to modify the custodial arrangement. The court reversed the judgment, reasoning that while appellant waived any objection to a lack of personal jurisdiction over her by availing herself of the forum, her conduct did not confer subject matter jurisdiction upon the trial court to modify the custody award. Further, the court determined that under both Tennessee and Georgia law, Georgia was the home state of the child when appellee filed his petition seeking custody. Furthermore, there was no indication that the courts of Georgia declined to exercise jurisdiction in deference to Tennessee as the more appropriate forum. Accordingly, the court concluded the trial court did not have jurisdiction to modify the custody award pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-6-203(a)(2) or (3) (repealed 1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment because the trial court did not have jurisdiction to modify the custodial arrangement. Additionally, the court remanded the case to the trial court for entry of an order dismissing appellee's petition seeking custody of the parties' minor child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband challenged the judgment of the Madison County Chancery Court (Tennessee) awarding appellee wife a divorce, distributing marital property, and awarding appellee alimony and child support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the trial court's judgment of divorce, contending that it erred in valuing property, distributing property, and determining his alimony and child support obligations. The court reversed the trial court's valuation of appellant's business on the ground that the trial court improperly included the business' goodwill in determining its value. Because the trial court incorrectly valued the business, the court reversed the alimony and marital property awards as they were partially based on the incorrect value of appellant's business. Appellant was entitled to a downward deviation from the guidelines for his child support obligation because evidence showed that appellant exercised 160 days of visitation with his daughter, rather than the 80 days relied upon by the guidelines. The trial court did not err by ordering a portion of appellant's monthly child support obligation be put into a college trust fund because appellant requested that the trial court establish such a fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed insofar as it determined the value of appellant's business, awarded appellee alimony and marital property, and ordered appellant pay child support as established by the child support guidelines. Judgment affirmed insofar as it ordered appellant to pay a portion of his child support obligation into a college trust fund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which granted the petition for termination and adoption, filed by petitioners, finding that the termination of the parental rights for both parents was in the best interests of the children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners brought a petition for the termination of respondent father's parental rights, and adoption. The trial court granted the petition for termination and adoption, finding the termination of the parental rights for both parents, was in the best interests of the children. On appeal, respondent argued whether there was clear and convincing evidence that respondent abandoned his children, and whether it was in the best interests of the minor children to terminate respondent's parental rights. The court affirmed the judgment, determining that the record evidenced an intent on respondent's part to avoid his parental responsibilities. Accordingly, the court found that there was clear and convincing evidence that respondent had abandoned his minor children, thereby establishing grounds for termination of his parental rights. Finally, the court concluded the evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding of clear and convincing evidence that the termination of respondent's parental rights was in the best interest of the children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings because the record evidenced an intent on respondent father's part to avoid his parental responsibilities.
