Va. Code &sect; 3-1-34(a) (2016) (Supp. 2016) were qualified to vote and, in fact, voted; [2]-The Supreme Court of Appeals found no reason to disturb the special court's ruling on the votes cast at the precinct; [3]-Even if the record had shown that the poll workers in a second precinct failed to properly take the required oath, case law would not permit rejecting the ballots cast in the precinct merely because of this defect; [4]-Although poll workers at a third precinct erred in demarcating the &quot;No Electioneering&quot; zone at the polling place, the Supreme Court of Appeals held that the voters of West Virginia cannot be disenfranchised or criminally penalized because of such errors.</SPAN></P>

Va. Code &sect; 11-15A-10a (2010) for the sales taxes it paid to the cities, counties, and other municipalities of other states on its purchases of motor fuel therein because, under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, and the dormant commerce clause, both the use tax imposed by W. Va. Code &sect; 11-15A-13a (2010) and the sales tax credit allowed by &sect; 11-15A-10a had a substantial nexus with the state, the use tax was fairly apportioned, the statutes were internally consistent, and were fairly related to the services provided to the railroad by the state as well as to the railroad's presence and activities therein.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ISSUE: Whether a mortgage issuer was entitled to compel arbitration of the parties' dispute pursuant to an arbitration agreement which the parties signed. HOLDINGS: [1]-The mortgage loan borrowers did not meet their burden of proving that the agreement was procedurally unconscionable because, while the bargaining power between the parties may have been unequal, it was not grossly unequal. Moreover, the inclusion of an arbitration provision within the mortgage loan agreement was not an oppressive or unconscionable term; [2]-The borrowers did not demonstrate that the arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable. Moreover, the circuit court relied on a non-existent requirement of complete mutuality of obligations in finding the agreement unenforceable and relied upon a record devoid of evidence that the borrowers could not pay the costs of arbitration.</SPAN></P>

Va. Code &sect; 12-3-10b (1996) on double jeopardy grounds for similarity to W. Va. Code &sect; 61-3-24d (1995) clearly erred because 50 counts did not arise from the same act, W. Va. Code &sect; 61-3-24d (1995) required fraud, unlike W. Va. Code &sect; 12-3-10b (1996), and W. Va. Code &sect; 12-3-10b (1996) required purchasing card use contrary to W. Va. Code &sect; 12-3-10a, unlike W. Va. Code &sect; 61-3-24d (1995); [3]-Prohibition was proper because the State could not, under W. Va. Code &sect; 58-5-30 (1998), appeal the indictment's dismissal not for insufficiency, it could not contest the dismissal post-trial, the trial court clearly erred, and the issue was of first impression.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-The sobriety checkpoint was legally valid and the motorist's arrest for DUI was lawful because the police department's deviation from its predetermined guidelines in the operation of the checkpoint did not result in the unreasonable exercise of discretion by the officer in charge of the checkpoint as the officer articulated a specific, reasonable explanation for moving the location of the checkpoint and utilizing less than the prescribed number of officers.

Va. R. App. P. 24, costs included attorney fees; [5]-The punitive damages award was reduced to the amount originally awarded; [6]-Further reduction of the punitive damages award was not warranted, but attorney fees and costs should have been included in the compensatory damages offset amount.</SPAN></P>

Further, the evidence before the grand jury was sufficient, as proven by the fact that the inmate was later found guilty of first degree sexual assault by a jury; [2]-The trial court did not err by finding that the inmate was properly convicted of aiding and abetting criminal acts for which the inmate's brother, the principal, was later acquitted.</SPAN></P>

P. 3.27 pending resolution of a disciplinary case arising from charges of domestic battery and violation of a protective order. HOLDINGS: [1]-Such a suspension was unwarranted because an order disqualifying him and his office from prosecuting cases involving crimes of violence by a parent, guardian, or custodian against a child, abuse and neglect cases, and criminal violations of domestic violence protection orders provided sufficient protection from any substantial threat of irreparable harm to the public, which was the standard under Rule 3.27, and alleviated any potential conflict of interest in violation of W. Va. R. Prof. Conduct 1.7, even considering the prosecutor's heightened standard of ethical conduct, as the potential conflict of interest did not extend to cases beyond those identified areas.</SPAN></P>

I protections was integrally connected to the criminal conduct at issue, the statute was viewed as a general criminal statute for purposes of conducting a vagueness analysis. Moreover, the challenged language of W. Va. Code &sect; 61-6-24 (2010) was free from constitutional defect on the ground of vagueness; [2]-Defendant's threat to sexually assault the child of a police officer when defendant was under arrest, handcuffed, and in a patrol car, did not constitute a terrorist act within the meaning of W. Va. Code &sect; 61-6-24(a)(3)(B)(iii) because the threatened action was not directed at intimidating or coercing the conduct of a branch or level of government.</SPAN></P>

Va. Code &sect; 62-3-15 (1994) was unconstitutional was rejected given case law that an instruction outlining factors which a jury should consider in determining whether to grant mercy in a first degree murder case should not be given.</SPAN></P>

Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 and U.S. Const. amend. IV as, in Virginia, a private citizen could have effected a citizen's arrest of defendant, and it followed that the West Virginia officers had the same rights as a private citizen and could make an arrest when the felony had actually been committed and the officer had reasonable grounds for believing the person arrested had committed the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juvenile appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court of Ohio County (West Virginia) that denied his request for a continuance and for discovery, upheld his expulsion from program at a youthful offender center, and denied his motion for credit for time served at the center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the juvenile pleaded guilty to entering without breaking, he was placed at the center. Following 18 institutional violations, the warden determined that the juvenile was unfit to continue his placement. Prior to the commencement of a hearing to determine if the warden abused his discretion in removing the juvenile from the center, defense counsel filed a motion for a continuance. The motion was denied, and the hearing went forward. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court upheld the termination of the juvenile's placement at the center, reinstated the original prison sentence, and ordered that the juvenile not be given any credit for the time served at the center. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that as the purpose of the hearing was not to re-determine the validity of the juvenile's violations, the circuit court did not err in denying the juvenile's motion for discovery, the request for a continuance, or in upholding the warden's determination to expel the juvenile from the center. However, it was a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5 to fail to credit the time served at a detention center under &sect; 25-4-6 (2011).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the denial of the request for credit for time served, and remanded for further proceedings; the judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner daughter challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), which found her in contempt for failure to obey a court order requiring her to account for the disposition of assets belonging to her mother, a protected person. The circuit court ordered the daughter to pay a per diem sanction to the mother through respondent conservator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court found that the daughter was exploiting her elderly mother and neglecting her needs. The daughter was found in contempt for refusing to obey the circuit court's order that she turn over documents and property to the conservator. The supreme court of appeals held that the circuit court's findings of fact were amply supported by the evidence. The appendix record contained not one scintilla of evidence to prove the daughter's inability to obey the circuit court's directives. That portion of the per diem penalty covering the period of time from the date on which the mental hygiene commissioner orally recommended that the daughter be held in contempt to the date of entry of the circuit court's order of contempt was impermissible because it &quot;smacked&quot; of a criminal penalty, rather than a coercive civil penalty which can be purged upon compliance. That portion of the per diem penalty which was prospective from the date of entry of the order of contempt to the date of the mother's death was a permissible civil contempt penalty because the daughter could have purged herself at any time after the contempt order and thus, avoided the penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court of appeals affirmed the order imposing a per diem contempt sanction upon the daughter from the date  the contempt order was entered through the date on which the mother died. It reversed the order imposing the per diem contempt sanction from the date the mental hygiene commissioner recommended that the daughter be held in contempt through the date on which the circuit court accepted the recommendation and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate brought a habeas corpus petition against respondent warden. The Circuit Court of Gilmer County (West Virginia) set aside the conviction and sentence of the inmate on nine of ten counts of sexual abuse by a guardian. The warden appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the indictment was constitutionally deficient because it did not provide adequate notice of each of the charges and potentially subjected the inmate to double jeopardy. The inmate argued that the indictment counts were worded identically and lacked factual information to differentiate the counts. However, the appellate court found that the inmate confessed and that confession, which was read into evidence at trial, was consistent with the victim's testimony regarding the abuse and the year the offenses occurred. The inmate never sought a bill of particulars, and did not assert an alibi defense. Moreover, the victim was a young adult by the time of trial and she testified at length about the abuse. It was arguable that the inmate was undercharged. The appellate court was convinced that the jury found separate and independent evidence to support its conviction of the inmate on each and every count. The indictment was constitutionally sufficient under W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 14. Had the inmate desired more information, he could have requested a bill of particulars or otherwise relief. The trial court erred in granting habeas relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting habeas relief was reversed and the appellate court ordered that the inmate remain imprisoned under the sentencing order entered in the underlying criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Va. Acts 178, and as administered by W. Va. Code &sect; 18-9A-11; (2) the Kanawha County BOE had a close relation to its students; and (3) sufficient hindrance to the individual students' ability to vindicate their constitutional rights existed such as to satisfy the requirements of jus tertii standing. W. Va. Code &sect; 18-9A-11 (2008), as amended, to the extent that it created a lack of uniformity in the educational financing system by requiring counties set forth in W. Va. Code &sect; 18-9A-11(g)(1)-(9) to pay their respective &quot;Special Act&quot; mandatory library funding obligations from their discretionary retainage or transfer the obligation to their excess levies, violated equal protection and was thus, unconstitutional and unenforceable under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the admission of an autopsy report without the accompanying testimony of the authoring pathologist violated the Confrontation clause of the United States and West Virginia Constitutions. The supreme court of appeals first found that the trial court's determination that the report was not testimonial was erroneous, as the report was testimonial given that defendant was under suspicion when the autopsy was conducted and therefore, the report could arguably have been prepared to accused a targeted individual. Next, the supreme court of appeals found that the trial court's determination that the expert's testimony, to the extent that he merely reiterated the contents of the report, did not violate the Confrontation Clause was erroneous, but that its finding that the admission of the expert's independently formed opinions did not violate the Confrontation Clause was proper. The supreme court of appeals found, however, that a new trial was not required, because Crawford/Mechling was a new principle of law, not subject to retroactive application and thus, defendant was not entitled to either a new trial or habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a large national mortgage lender (ML), sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Ohio County (West Virginia), which denied its post-trial motions under W. Va. R. Civ. P. 60(b) for amendment of the findings and/or conclusions, and for offset after it was held  liable to plaintiff borrower for common law fraud and claims under the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act, W. Va. Code &sect; 46A-1-101 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borrower applied for consolidation of her property debt with the ML, and she was ultimately persuaded to proceed based on an alleged promise of refinancing. However, the ML thereafter refused to refinance the loan. The trial court found that the appraisal was grossly inflated, review thereof was negligently conducted, and the executed loan varied greatly from the original loan presented to the borrower. Post-trial relief was denied. On appeal, the court found that there was clear and convincing evidence that the ML committed fraud, statutorily deceptive practices, and unconscionability with respect to the loan. However, the trial court lacked legal authority to cancel the borrower's obligation to repay the loan principal. Rather, a balancing of the equities required that the parties be returned to the status quo. The trial court's conclusory order on punitive damages did not satisfy the requirements for purposes of reviewability. The court held that attorneys fees under W. Va. Code &sect; 46A-5-104 (1995) were to be included in the compensatory to punitive damages ratio, and the ML was entitled to an offset for settlements received by the borrower from others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court with respect to one aspect of the fraud finding regarding discount points, and as to the remedies of punitive damages and cancellation of the loan principal. The matter was otherwise affirmed, and the court remanded the case with directions to provide further analysis under the punitive damage claim, and to provide an offset to the ML for settlement amounts received by the borrower.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, state troopers or their survivors, sought review of orders from the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), which dismissed their complaint against respondents, a public retirement board (PRB), the state police, and related others, alleging that they were placed in the wrong retirement plan. The trial court also denied petitioners' motion under W. Va. R. Civ. P. 60(b) for relief from the dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners asserted that when they became employed by the state police, they believed that they would be enrolled in retirement plan A but instead, they were enrolled in plan B. Petitioners sought a writ of mandamus to compel the PRB to transfer them into plan A. The trial court granted the PRB's dismissal motion. After the PRB denied petitioners' placement into plan A, petitioners appealed and the trial court granted summary judgment to respondents. Petitioners filed the instant matter, and the trial court entered orders against them. On appeal, the court found that petitioners were collaterally estopped from raising the issues that had been previously decided by the trial court's review, on appeal, of the PRB decision. Dismissal of the complaint against the State and other entities was proper, based on immunity under W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 35, W. Va. Code &sect; 5-10D-1(a), as well as other jurisdictional bases. The trial court properly found that damages sought by petitioners were excluded by the clear and unambiguous language of the state police's liability insurance policy. As dismissal was proper, relief therefrom under Rule 60(b) was properly denied as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurer sought a writ of prohibition to prevent respondent, the judge of the Circuit Court of Harrison County, West Virginia, from enforcing the medical protective order (MPO) he issued in favor of respondent, an injured party who had sued the insurer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners claimed compliance with the MPOs would preclude them from fulfilling their mandatory reporting obligations imposed by federal and state governments. The high court disagreed. The MPOs recognized that a party receiving the protected information might be obligated to disclose the information to fulfill its mandatory reporting obligations and made specific provision for this potentiality. While compliance with the MPOs' directive to &quot;return or destroy&quot; the medical records might be difficult, it would not be impossible. The MPOs did not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, or petitioners' rights to free speech and due process. The West Virginia Insurance Commissioner's privacy rules did not serve as a substitute for a court-issued order regulating the manner in which discovery is to be conducted, as petitioners argued, since this would invade the province of the judiciary in violation of the separation of powers doctrine contained in W. Va. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. With respect to the MPOs' terms &quot;medical records&quot; and &quot;medical information,&quot; the high court would not substitute its definition of those terms for that of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner convict appealed an order entered by the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, West Virginia, which granted respondent Jefferson County Sheriff's Department's (State) summary judgment motion in a forfeiture proceeding involving the convict's home under the West Virginia Contraband Forfeiture Act, W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-7-701 et seq. (Supp. 2012).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that the summary judgment was improper as the State failed to introduce any evidence to establish any connection between the drug transaction to which the convict pled guilty and the convict's property. The State sought forfeiture under W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-7-703(a)(8) (Supp. 2012). It was error to conclude that the forfeiture did not violate the Excessive Fines Clauses, U.S. Const. amend. VIII, and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5, based solely on the convict's culpability. Since the forfeiture action was initiated under state law, the authorized penalty by which the amount of the forfeiture had to be compared was under West Virginia, not federal law. The maximum fine to which the convict was subjected was $ 25,000 under W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-4-401(a)(i) (2010). There was no evidence as to the value of the convict's home or the convict's criminal history. There was no evidence that the property was being used for repeated drug activities. The sole basis for the forfeiture was the single sale of 4.8 grams of crack cocaine for $ 600. The case was remanded for a proportionality hearing and determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing and a ruling on whether the forfeiture of the convict's property was grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the convict's offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner candidate for the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondents state officials to comply with W. Va. Code &sect; 3-12-11(e) (2010) and approve the release of matching funds to his campaign, pursuant to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals Public Campaign Financing Pilot Program (Program), W. Va. Code &sect; 3-12-1, et seq. (2010).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Program, the candidate was a publicly financed candidate entitled to matching public campaign funds based on a privately financed opponent's campaign spending. The supreme court of appeals held he was not entitled to a writ of mandamus because the matching funds provisions in W. Va. Code &sect; 3-12-11(e) - (i) (2010) violated the First Amendment, as they (1) substantially burdened his opponents' political speech, since no judicial elections exception existed to U.S. Supreme Court precedent holding a similar program created such a burden, and (2) were not narrowly tailored to further the compelling state interest in W. Va. Code &sect; 3-12-2(9) (2010), as less restrictive remedies were available and they did not accomplish the Program's goal. The provisions were severable because the rest of the Program was complete in itself, independently capable of execution, and valid in aspects unrelated to matching funds. The candidate could keep an initial disbursement because it did not depend on opponents' campaign spending. He could raise private funds, despite the bar in W. Va. Code &sect; 3-12-12, because he detrimentally relied on the Program's unconstitutional promise of matching funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Commissioner of the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV), administratively revoked respondent driver's license. The Circuit Court of Mason County (West Virginia) found that W. Va. Code &sect; 17C-5C-3 terminated DMV jurisdiction, determined the 2010 amendment to W. Va. Code &sect; 17C-5A-2 applied to the driver's 2009 DUI arrest, and reversed the administrative license revocation. The DMV appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DMV argued that &sect; 17C-5C-3 did not immediately divest it of jurisdiction upon the statute's effective date. The appellate court agreed, finding the West Virginia Legislature clearly established a period of transition of jurisdictional authority from the DMV to the Office of Administrative Hearings through its enactment of W. Va. Code &sect; 17C-5C-5 (2010). The Secretary of Transportation thereafter properly appointed a designee to oversee that orderly transition, and the DMV retained jurisdiction of incidents occurring prior to June 11, 2010, which included the incident and hearing at issue. The 2010 amendment to &sect; 17C-5A-2 was not retroactive because the amendment included a requirement for a lawful arrest, which constituted a substantive alteration, and represented a change in the rights and obligations of the parties; thus, the 2008 version of the statute, which did not require a lawful arrest, was applicable. Although the safety checkpoint at which the driver was initially stopped did not comply with certain procedural safeguards, the lower court erred in applying the exclusionary rule in the license revocation proceeding because the rule only applied in criminal matters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's order was reversed and the matter was remanded for entry of an order reinstating the driver's civil administrative license revocation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent driver sought judicial review in the Circuit Court of Mercer County (West Virginia) of the decision of petitioner, Commissioner of the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles (Commissioner) to revoke his driver's license for 90 days under W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 17C-5A-2(j) (2008), 17C-5A-3(c)(5)(A) (2008), and 17B-3-9 (2005). The trial court reversed the revocation, and the Commissioner sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court based its decision on a finding that the vehicle equipment checkpoint at which the driver was stopped was unconstitutional. The supreme court of appeals held it was error to reverse the Commissioner's decision because the exclusionary rule did not apply in a civil, administrative hearing concerning the revocation or suspension of a driver's license, as (1) the purpose of revocation procedures was to protect innocent persons by removing intoxicated drivers from the public roadways as quickly as possible, and this purpose would be thwarted by applying the exclusionary rule to administrative license revocation proceedings, (2) applying the rule to such proceedings had a minimal likelihood of deterring police misconduct, which was the rule's purpose, since the real punishment for such misconduct was excluding unlawfully seized evidence in a criminal proceeding, and (3) the cost to society of applying the rule to revocation proceedings outweighed any benefit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father said it was error to let a probation officer testify by telephone. The supreme court of appeals disagreed because (1) the officer was a rebuttal witness, (2) the father was not prejudiced, and (3) any error was harmless as sufficient evidence existed without the testimony to deny him an improvement period and terminate his parental rights. It was not error to deny him an improvement period, under W. Va. Code &sect; 49-6-12(b), upon finding he did not show by clear and convincing evidence that he would likely participate, because (1) improvement periods were discretionary, and (2) he did not meet his burden, as he did not admit his drug addiction caused him to medically neglect his children. His burden of proof was not unconstitutional because he was not entitled to an improvement period. DHHR made reasonable reunification efforts, under W. Va. Code &sect; 49-6-5, because (1) it provided services related to his drug abuse and medical neglect before and after filing abuse and neglect proceedings, and (2) he did not comply with them or try to remedy problems with them.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner sought review of an order denying his petition for post-conviction habeas corpus relief by the Circuit Court, Mercer County (West Virgnia) pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 53-4A-1. Following a hearing, the prisoner's probation had been revoked and his original sentence reinstated. The prisoner raised several issues, including whether his various court-appointed counsel were effective and whether his guilty plea was voluntary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner pled guilty to violating W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-4-401. A petition to revoke his probation was filed on the basis that he had been arrested for grand larceny, had failed to report the arrest to his probation officer, and had failed to report to the probation department as directed. The Supreme Court found the prisoner's revocation was not revoked due to the removal of a home confinement bracelet but due to his violation of his probation for the grounds stated at the hearing. Thus, counsel's representation was not ineffective on the issue of not investigating why the home confinement bracelet was removed. There was no reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. Nor was counsel ineffective in his representation of the prisoner due to his briefly representing the co-defendants. The prisoner was not constitutionally mandated to receive a preliminary hearing. Finally, the claim of entering into an involuntary plea was without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed from a West Virginia circuit court's order revoking his probation and reimposing his original sentence of five to eighteen years in prison. Petitioner had been charged with first degree robbery but had pled guilty to second degree robbery. His probation sentence came about as a result of a motion to reconsider the prison sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although petitioner's indictment cited the wrong subsection of W. Va. Code &sect; 61-2-12(a), the indictment was sufficient because it specifically alleged that petitioner had committed first degree robbery, and the trial court had corrected the statutory citation long before petitioner pled guilty on the lesser included offense. Petitioner's sentence, which was within statutory limits, was not disproportionate to that of an accomplice where the accomplice had waited in a car while petitioner entered the store brandishing a large wrench. Petitioner did not contest the ruling that he violated his probation by using a methamphetamine and providing a diluted urine specimen. Thus, revocation of his probation was not an abuse of discretion. Finally, the record reflected that petitioner entered his guilty plea freely, knowingly, and voluntarily; petitioner unequivocally informed the trial court that he understood his rights, that he wished to plead guilty, and that no one had unduly influenced him to plead guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner had agreed to speak with the Sheriff in order to assist a friend with regard to the friend's federal prosecution in an unrelated case. Given the deferential treatment which had to be afforded the trial court's factual findings, the reviewing court could not conclude that the ruling to admit the prisoner's statements was clearly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. The trial court found that the initial statement given to the Sheriff by the prisoner was voluntary and non-custodial, that the prisoner had effectively waived his right to counsel at the time such statement was made, that no promises of leniency or immunity were given, and that while one of the recorded statements may have demonstrated some sign of intoxication it was not enough to have overcome the prisoner's mentality and reasoning. While the prisoner pointed to the existence of widespread media coverage of his trial, he failed to show that this media coverage coincided with a pervasive hostile sentiment against him in the community which rendered it impossible for him to receive a fair trial. The prisoner did not show counsel was ineffective or the requisite prejudice under Strickland/Miller.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed the denial by the Mercer County Circuit Court (West Virginia) of his petition for post-conviction habeas corpus relief under W.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court adopted the trial court's opinion. The inmate did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel by counsel's failure to assert available defenses. The inmate was evaluated for competency three times. Each examiner found the inmate competent to stand trial and criminally responsible. The inmate abandoned his claims regarding the primary investigating officer serving as the bailiff for a portion of the trial. The trial court allowed bifurcation at the request of the inmate, with no objection from the State. The State was limited in the presentation of evidence to the restrictive bounds set by Rygh. Trial counsel's decision to seek to bifurcate the trial under W. Va. Code &sect; 62-3-15 (2005) was a reasonable tactical decision as it allowed the inmate to present mitigating evidence in the form of character testimony as to the inmate's being under the influence of drugs and alcohol, his behavior while confined, his work history and injuries and his use of oxycontin on the day of the crime that would not have been admissible otherwise. The decision to bifurcate the trial was not damaging to the inmate as he received mercy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted in the Circuit Court for Mercer County (West Virginia) of two counts of delivery of a schedule II controlled substance and sentenced to consecutive sentences, enhanced under W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-4-408, totalling 4 to 60 years. After his appeal was denied, he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate said counsel ineffectively waived a preliminary hearing. The supreme court of appeals disagreed because (1) it was not constitutionally required, and (2) he waived it. The trial judge's remarks did not entitle him to relief because (1) they were made at sentencing, and (2) they referred to permissible sentencing factors. The timing of the inmate's indictment, under W. Va. Code &sect; 62-2-12, did not require reversal because (1) he was not imprisoned for more than two terms of court, and (2) the remedy for a violation was not reversal. Poor quality of videos of the inmate's drug deals did not make the evidence insufficient because testimony of an informant and the inmate supported the convictions. W. Va. R. Evid. 404(b) evidence was not improperly admitted because the inmate presented it. An informant's false testimony about her employment did not warrant relief because (1) nothing showed it was knowingly presented, and (2) it had no material effect on the verdict. The inmate's sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment or W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5 because W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-4-408 allowed the enhancement, so it was within statutory limits and based on permissible factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia held that W. Va. Code &sect; 61-6-21(b), which defined the offense of criminal civil rights violations, was not unconstitutionally vague, because the terms in the statute were clear in prohibiting the use of either physical means or a communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another or on another person's property. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for three counts of criminal civil rights violations, because she directed threats, racial slurs, profanity and used hand gestures against the victims, her African-American neighbors. Defendant's six-year suspended sentence was not excessive or disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment or W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court of Appeals carefully considered the merits of each of defendant's arguments as set forth in his petition for appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that while it was true that due process afforded criminal defendants a due process right to finality of sentence, W. Va. R. Crim. P. 35(a) allowed an illegal sentence to be corrected at any time. Moreover, although due process may be denied when a sentence was enhanced after the defendant served so much of his sentence that his expectations as to its finality have crystallized and it would be fundamentally unfair to defeat them, in the instant matter, the court declined to find that the inmate met such considerations. Specifically, the inmate was sentenced to the 50 years of supervised release at the same time he was sentenced to two years of incarceration upon revocation of his probation. As such, he had not yet served so much of his sentence as to have expected its finality to have crystallized. While it was true that the inmate had served almost three years of probation prior to the revocation, the court declined to find that the circuit court's correction of the original illegal sentence during revocation violated the inmate's due process rights, especially in light of the extraordinary facts of the particular case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding, petitioners voters and county officials sought writs of mandamus and prohibition barring the implementation of W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 1-2-1 and 1-2-2 (2011), which created new districts for the West Virginia House of Delegates and the West Virginia Senate, based on alleged violations of the West Virginia Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A voter said W. Va. Code &sect; 1-2-2 (2011) violated W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6 by dividing counties. The Supreme Court of Appeals disagreed because (1) a &quot;whole&quot; county did not have to be attached to a county to form a district, and (2) counties could be divided. A multi-member district delegate residency requirement did not violate W. Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4 or art. VI, &sect; 12 because it served legitimate public purposes. It did not violate W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 39's &quot;local bills&quot; bar because implementing it was a legislative issue. W. Va. Code &sect; 1-2-1 (2011) did not violate equal representation requirements in W. Va. Const. art. II, &sect; 4, or art. VI, &sect; 4, because its stated policy interests showed required balancing. Its division of counties did not offend W. Va. Const. art.

Code &sect; 1-2-1(c)(4), and (2) communities of interest were considered, W. Va. Code &sect; 1-2-1(c)(5). The statute did not violate W. Va. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court of appeals found no error in the circuit court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because the conduct fit within the relevant statutes.&nbsp;Section 61-8A-1 defined what matter that, when distributed to a minor, was a felony. That definition encompassed either a recorded sexual act, as the State claimed was played to the minor, or the playing of an adult television program depicting an explicit sexual act, as defendant claimed. The term &quot;distribute&quot; as used in the statute included &quot;transmit,&quot; and the obscene telephone call at issue fell within that definition because defendant used the telephone to &quot;transmit&quot; obscene materials to a minor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner owners brought an action against respondents city, board, and others, challenging the constitutionality of Hurricane, W.V., Mun. Ord. &sect;&sect; 936.031, 936.05, which imposed a &quot;stormwater service charge&quot; upon them. The Putnam County Circuit Court (West Virginia) granted summary judgment in favor of the city and the board, upheld the ordinance, and denied the owners' request for injunctive relief. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners all lived outside, but within 20 miles, of the city limits. Stormwater ran off of their properties into the city's stormwater drainage system. The owners argued that imposition of the charge under &sect;&sect; 936.031, 936.05 violated their right to equal protection and due process. However, the appellate court found that the United States Supreme Court had already rejected almost identical equal protection and due process challenges. The stormwater ordinance bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose, which was to reduce the amount of sediment, bacteria, and trash in stormwater runoff that flowed into and was treated by the city. A reasonable way to meet this goal was to impose a fee on the people who benefitted from and used the stormwater management system. The trial court correctly determined that this is a fee. The charge imposed by &sect;&sect; 936.031, 936.05 was a fee. The charge was only on &quot;users&quot; who paid an equitable share of the actual cost of the operation, maintenance of, improvements to, and necessary additions to, the stormwater system. The owners did not allege that the money collected from this charge was used for purposes other than the stormwater system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation appealed respondent county assessor's valuation of real estate owned by the corporation to a county board of review and equalization. The board denied the objections to the real estate tax assessment and approved the assessor's valuation of the subject property. The corporation appealed to the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (West Virginia). The court dismissed the appeals. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation failed to retain a lawyer to prosecute its appeals to the circuit court. Instead, the corporation appeared through its vice-president. The circuit judge ordered the corporation to appear through a lawyer in the circuit court and stated that the court would not accept pleadings or motions from the corporation that were not signed by a lawyer. Despite this order from the circuit court, the corporation failed to retain a lawyer. The circuit court thereby dismissed the corporation's appeals. On appeal, the court found that (1) the circuit court did not err, pursuant to  W. Va. Trial Ct. R. 4.03, when it ruled that the corporation was required to be represented by a lawyer in the circuit court; (2) W. Va. Code &sect; 11-3-25(b) (2010) was unconstitutional only insofar as the word &quot;agent&quot; allowed an applicant's nonlawyer representative to appeal a decision of the board of equalization and review to a circuit court; (3) although the corporation was a closely-held corporation, the general rule requiring a corporation to be represented by a lawyer in a trial court of record was not to be relaxed; and (4) the corporation's due process rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order by the circuit court (West Virginia) that convicted him of first-degree sexual abuse, assault during the commission of a felony, and battery; defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support the assault and abuse charges, and that W. Va. Code &sect; 62-12-26 (2009) violated the due process clauses of the West Virginia and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the midst of defendant's assault on a female victim, the male victim walked into the room and began to fight with defendant. Defendant threw the male victim backwards onto a pool table, injuring the victim's back in the process. Thereafter, as the female victim was attempting to shower and leave, defendant entered the shower stall nude, at which time his penis made contact with her vagina. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, in a memorandum opinion, found, inter alia, that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction of assault during the commission of a felony. The jury clearly determined that the female's testimony was credible enough to convict defendant. The requirement in &sect; 62-12-26 that defendant be placed under extended supervision was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge petitioner's competency to stand trial under W. Va. &sect; 27-6A-3 because counsel received the expert opinions of two psychiatrists, who found petitioner competent and criminally responsible. Petitioner's trial counsel had no good faith basis to pursue any remedy related to his competency to stand trial or criminal responsibility; therefore, his decision not to request a competency hearing was a matter of strategy and was not objective unreasonable, given the fact that counsel would have had to impeach his own expert witnesses. Further, petitioner's guilty plea was not involuntary, and the court rejected petitioner's argument that the circuit court failed to educate him of the nature and consequences of his plea agreement because the transcript of the plea hearing clearly demonstrated that the trial judge thoroughly reviewed all of petitioner's rights with him and completely met the obligations incumbent upon him W. Va. R. Crim. P. 11 and because the plea bargain letter signed by petitioner clearly stated the potential imprisonment that petitioner faced if convicted of the sex offenses charged.</SPAN></P>

She testified that defendant had put his penis in her vagina at least once a month for the seven months, January through July 2007. A doctor testified that she had no remnants of a hymen. Defendant argued that the sentence was excessive under W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5. The court held that the sentence was within statutory limits and was based in part upon defendant's criminal history and many parole and probation violations, giving a substantial risk that he would re-offend. The court held that evidence from the victim that defendant had put his penis in her vagina at least once a month during the first seven months of 2007 supported defendant's convictions for the incident in January, although the victim's specific testimony of that incident was only that defendant had moved her clothing aside to allow himself access to her private parts.</SPAN></P>

The city and officers challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), which refused to grant them summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that there was no dispute with regard to any of the facts relevant to the qualified immunity determination that would warrant support for the trial court's position to forego deciding the immunity issue at the summary judgment stage. The facts supported that the officers' investigation of the incident was warranted, and the citizen demonstrated no constitutional basis for failing to comply with the investigation. The circumstances of the case provided adequate grounds for the a reasonable law enforcement officer to have believed that the use of force was justified in performance of his or her duties. The officers arrived at the scene of what appeared to be a hostile confrontation of six young men who were yelling and cursing at one another in a public area with two of the young men visibly carrying objects that could serve as weapons. A reasonable officer in the same situation could have believed that a crime was in progress or about to be committed and deduced that steps needed to be taken to diffuse the situation. There was no basis on which to conclude that a reasonable officer would be on notice that the conduct complained of was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

Instead, petitioner confirmed that he understood the indictment, the elements of the crime with which he was charged, and that he knew he did not have to plea guilty. The circuit court explained each constitutional right petitioner had, including the burden of proof upon the State to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and petitioner's right to challenge the evidence, and petitioner acknowledge that he understood pleading guilty would waive each of the Constitutional rights outlined by the court. At no time did petitioner assert his innocence and instead answered &quot;guilty&quot; when asked how he plead.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, county boards of education (BOEs), brought a declaratory judgment action against respondents, the Public Employees Insurance Agency, the Public Employees Insurance Agency Finance Board, and the West Virginia State Auditor, in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia). The court denied the request for declaratory relief. The county boards of education appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The BOEs filed an action for various declarations defining the actual scope of their liability for unpaid employer contributions under W. Va. Code &sect; 5-16D-6(e) (2007) (amended 2011). They also requested the circuit court to declare that W. Va. Code &sect; 5-16D-6 was unconstitutional because it interfered with their ability to provide a thorough and efficient system of free schools as required by W. Va. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1. The circuit court determined that the BOEs' claims did not satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisites for the exercise of jurisdiction because they involved uncertain and contingent events; no adversity existed between the parties; and the requested declarations would not resolve the underlying controversy. The BOEs contended that they presented a justiciable controversy so as to permit the court to award them the declaratory relief. On appeal, the court found that the circuit court did not err by denying declaratory relief to the BOEs based upon its conclusion that the BOEs' claims presented a nonjusticiable political question and did not satisfy the jurisdictional requirements for a declaratory judgment proceeding under W. Va. Code &sect; 55-13-1 (1941) (amended 2008).</SPAN></P>

The commission filed a petition for a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge found that the commission had acted arbitrarily and capriciously by reducing the sheriff's budget and directed the commission to meet with the sheriff to determine an amount that was fair and reasonable and to present a revised budget.

The high court held that as there was no evidentiary basis for the trial judge's conclusion that the sheriff's statutory duties would be affected by the commission's reduction in his budget within the meaning of W. Va. Code &sect; 7-7-7, he exceeded his authority in issuing a writ of mandamus directing the commission to prepare a revised budget. The trial judge had no basis for his ruling that the &quot;meeting&quot; requirement necessary to comply with the mandates of &sect; 7-7-7 had to be &quot;meaningful.&quot; And as the record did not support the trial judge's conclusion that the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously or that it failed to comply with &sect; 7-7-7, his award of attorney's fees to the sheriff was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim told the police that she was sitting in her truck with the door open when defendant appeared, asked if she had a boyfriend, and attempted to kiss her. The victim also told the police that she resisted, but that defendant touched her breast and reached under her skirt and touched her pubic area. Defendant denied reaching under the victim's skirt, but admitted that he touched the victim's breast and attempted to kiss her. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, in a memorandum opinion, found, inter alia, that it had already upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 62-12-26. The period of prison incarceration and the period of extended supervision were both within the provisions of the respective statutes. Both evaluating mental health professionals recommended that defendant be incapacitated.

The jury returned a verdict in favor of the patient and his wife. The circuit court, pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-8 (2008), reduced the noneconomic damages award and denied the hospital's motions for judgment and a new trial. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court reduced the noneconomic damages award to $500,000, because the court found that the patient suffered a permanent and substantial physical deformity warranting application of the higher cap amount. The patient and his wife contended that the cap contained in W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-8 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-8 was constitutional. It did not violate the state constitutional right to a jury trial, separation of powers, equal protection, special legislation, or the certain remedy provisions, W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 13; W.

In addition, the circuit court did not err by finding that the $ 500,000 cap, rather than the $ 250,000 cap, on noneconomic damages was applicable as the patient suffered permanent and substantial loss of use of his legs and the loss of his muscle system. Finally, the hospital was liable, pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-3 (2008), for having failed to notify the doctor of the possible side effects of the medicines which were prescribed by the doctor for the patient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, a nonprofit charitable corporation, filed suit in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), alleging that appellants, the West Virginia Family Protection Services Board and its members, were implementing the West Virginia Domestic Violence Act, W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 48-26-101 to 48-26-1101 (2009 &amp; Supp. 2010), in a discriminatory manner. The court granted summary judgment to the corporation. The Board and its members appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonprofit charitable corporation challenged the West Virginia Family Protection Services Board's legislative rules for conflicting with the legislative intent underlying the West Virginia Domestic Violence Act (WVDVA), both by discriminating on the basis of gender in shelters and programs of intervention for perpetrators of domestic violence and by infringing on the corporation's First Amendment free speech rights. On appeal, the court found that the corporation did not have standing to bring its claims. Nothing in the Board's legislative rules chilled protected speech by the corporation or anyone else. Further, the circuit court's decision to render three of the Board's legislative rules, W. Va. Code R. &sect;&sect; 191-2-1, 191-2-4.11, and 191-3-3, null and void lacked any legal basis because none of these sections served to chill the corporation's speech, as nothing in the Board's legislative rules imposed any restrictions on the corporation's ability to engage in constitutionally protected speech. Furthermore, none of the provisions conflicted with the clear legislative intent found in the WVDVA to prohibit discrimination based on sex under W. Va. Code &sect; 48-26-601(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The final order of the circuit court was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions to the circuit court to enter an order dismissing the action for lack of standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three consolidated cases, appellant offenders sought review of sentencing orders of the Circuit Court of Ohio County, the Circuit Court of Mineral County, and the Circuit Court of Logan County, all of West Virginia, that included, pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 62-12-26 (2009), a period of extended supervision following release from incarceration as a sex offender. The offenders contended the statute was facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that &sect; 62-12-26 was not facially unconstitutional. Supervised release, which the statute required as additional punishment for offenses committed mostly by sex offenders, was not cruel or unusual under U.S. Const. amend. VIII or W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5. The supervised release was less restrictive on personal liberty than the incarceration preceding the release, and the period of supervision was contingent upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The court also held that the statute did not facially violate due process principles of U.S. Const. amend. XIV or W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10 by authorizing courts, by summary proceeding and without jury involvement, to impose an additional penalty of supervised release. No further fact finding was needed to determine applicability of the supervised release requirement once there was a conviction for one of the designated offenses. The court concluded that the statute was not facially unconstitutional on double jeopardy grounds in requiring sentences for persons convicted of certain crimes to include a term of supervised release because the supervised release was part of a single sentence for those crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the sentencing orders of the circuit courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a special election, the former governor was elected to fill a United States Senate vacancy halfway through his term. The senate president began to act as governor pursuant to W. Va. Const. art. VII, &sect; 16 and W. Va. Code &sect; 3-10-2. He argued that filling the vacancy in the office of the governor was to occur during the next general election. The court held that under &sect; 16, the period of time in which the duties of the governor were to be performed by a person who was not elected to the office was not to exceed one year. Whenever a vacancy occurred before the first three years of a governor's term expired, a new statewide election was to be held as soon as practicable. The court concluded that the portion of &sect; 3-10-2 that provided that if a vacancy in the office of the governor occurred more than 30 days before a general election, the vacancy shall be filled at that election was unconstitutional when applied to the facts of the case as it would delay the election to fill the vacancy in the office of the governor for nearly two years until the next general election. The court concluded that the requirements for mandamus had been met as far as the senate president was concerned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition for a writ of mandamus against the senate president in his official capacity and as acting governor. He was directed to set a statewide election to fill the vacancy within one year and in accordance with the provisions of &sect; 3-10-2 for such an election. The petitions for writs of mandamus against the speaker of the house and the secretary of state were denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an amended order entered by the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, which re-sentenced defendant for purposes of appeal after he was convicted of attempted murder, malicious assault, arson, violation of a domestic violence protective order, and domestic battery. The state's highest court granted the petition for appeal only as to the proper application of credit for time served by defendant prior to sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that for purposes of calculating a defendant's parole eligibility date, credit for time served by the defendant prior to being sentenced was to be applied to the aggregate minimum term of all the consecutive sentences combined. To the extent State v. Middleton, 220 W. Va. 89, 640 S.E.2d 152 (2006), mandated that the time served during presentence incarceration be credited only against the aggregated maximum term of the consecutive sentences, it was overruled. Defendant was sentenced to consecutive sentences. His effective penitentiary sentence was 6-27 years, and defendant's time served (495 days) had to be credited against the six-year minimum in calculating his parole eligibility date. The time served credit applied to the total effective sentence, not separately to each component of the sentence. One credit for time served was to be applied to the aggregate minimum terms of all consecutive sentences combined. Thus, the trial court's effective sentencing date had to be adjusted to March 29, 2006, the date defendant was first incarcerated on the charges while awaiting trial, to give him credit for 495 days toward his parole eligibility date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amended sentencing order was reversed and remanded with directions to adjust defendant's effective sentencing date to March 29, 2006, the date defendant was first incarcerated on the charges while awaiting trial, to give him credit for 495 days toward his parole eligibility date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the West Virginia Consolidated Public Retirement Board, determined that appellee retirees were not entitled to include the amount of their lump sum payments for unused annual leave in their final average salary calculations. The Circuit Court of Lewis County (West Virginia) and the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia) reversed the decision and one court refused to reinstate one retiree's service credit. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retirees sought to increase their final average salaries, thereby ultimately increasing their monthly pension payments, by adding the amount of the lump sum payment each received for unused annual leave to the calculation of their final average salary. The Board contended that the retirees were not entitled to a benefit afforded to West Virginia Public Employee Retirement System participants by a 1988 amendment to W. Va. Code &sect; 5-5-3, given that the West Virginia Legislature effectively repealed that benefit in 1989. One retiree also contended that he was entitled to reinstatement of service credit for two months of work performed by him one summer. On appeal, the court found that, because the retirees were not entitled to a presumption of detrimental reliance and failed to establish actual detrimental reliance, neither of the retirees was entitled to include the amount of their lump sum payments for unused annual leave in the calculation of their final average salaries. Additionally, the one retiree was not entitled under W. Va. Code &sect; 5-10-22(a) to reinstate two months of service credit erroneously awarded to him for his work during one summer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The final orders of the circuit courts, finding that the retirees were entitled to include the amount of their lump sum payments for unused annual leave in their final average salary calculations, were reversed, and the decisions of the Board were reinstated. The circuit court's ruling as to one retiree's cross-assignment of error, finding that the retiree was not entitled to receive two months of service credit for his work, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that because the victim's aunt never had actual physical possession or care and custody of the victim, defendant was not automatically a custodian under W.

Defendant and the aunt did not go to the victim's house to watch the victim and a sibling. Although the sister who was watching the victim was sleeping during the touching incident, the children's mother had charged the sister with being the caretaker. The sister remained in charge despite the presence of defendant and the aunt. When she discovered the incident, the sister demanded that the aunt and defendant leave the premises, and she called the police. Defendant was also not a person in a position of trust in relation to the victim. The victim had not left the premises and was not under the care, custody, or control of defendant when she was subjected to the abuse. Although defendant had previously been responsible for the general supervision of the victim's welfare under W. Va.

P. 12(b)(6), dismissed the newspaper's civil complaint against appellee clerk of the county commission, seeking to compel disclosure of a referendum petition under the West Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), W.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county commission passed a traditional zoning ordinance, replacing a nontraditional ordinance. Shortly thereafter, a citizen group forced a ballot referendum on the ordinance pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 8A-7-13(j) (2008). The trial court erred in dismissing the newspaper's complaint because disclosure of the referendum petition under the FOIA served a vital function in protecting the integrity of the electoral process and in promoting transparency and accountability in the conduct of the public's business, under W. Va. Code &sect; 29B-1-2(4) (1977). Further, the trial court erred in holding that signatures on the referendum petition were the functional equivalent of a secret ballot, that no valid purpose existed for making the signatures appearing on a referendum petition public, and that disclosing the names of signatories on a referendum petition could have had an unconstitutional chilling effect on the ability of citizens to petition the government in violation of U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder without a recommendation of mercy and sentenced to life without mercy for the killing of his wife. Having granted defendant's habeas petition and ordered a new trial as to whether defendant should receive a recommendation of mercy, the Circuit Court of Greenbrier County (West Virginia) certified questions to the court regarding W.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During sentencing, the jury had been instructed that if it recommended mercy, defendant would be eligible for parole in ten years; however, W. Va. Code &sect; 62-3-15 (2005)  had been amended and required defendant to serve fifteen years before becoming eligible for parole. Defendant filed a habeas petition, and the circuit court granted habeas relief to defendant in the form of a new trial on the issue of whether he should receive a recommendation of mercy. During the pretrial proceedings for the retrial of the mercy phase, the circuit court certified questions. The court held that because of the lack of a burden of proof in the bifurcated mercy phase of a first-degree murder trial, the circuit court incorrectly found that there was an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof from the prosecution to defendant. The court held that &sect; 62-3-15 did not require the jury that determined guilt be the same jury that determined the issue of mercy, but the jury verdict did have to be unanimous. Finally, the court held that while defendant would proceed first at the mercy phase, the circuit court retained the inherent authority to conduct the proceeding in a fair and orderly manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant horse owners sought review of the West Virginia Racing Commission's decision affirming the decision of appellee board of stewards that the owners had violated a rule promulgated by the Commission, W. Va. Code R. &sect; 178-66.5. They challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (West Virginia), which affirmed the Commission's ruling and determined that the rule was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' horse won a race. Following the race, tests on the horse were positive for the drug caffeine. The Commission's zero-tolerance rule prohibited the presence of any drug substance in a horse, regardless of whether the drug substance stimulated the horse or impacts the horse's performance. The board of stewards disqualified the horse. The owners argued that the rule was unconstitutional because it was arbitrary, capricious, and it had no rational relationship to the regulation of horse racing. The supreme court of appeals held that the rule was rationally related to the reasonable regulation of horse racing and was constitutional. The Commission had the power to enact regulations to prohibit the racing of a horse with drugs. Its zero tolerance rule was a reasonable method of preventing horses from being raced when they had drugs in their system. The rule was constitutional and rationally related to the goal of preventing horses from being raced when they have any drug-like substance in them, and the goal of preventing post-race litigation regarding whether that substance had any effect on the horse's race performance.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Jefferson County (West Virginia) denied the neighbors' petition for writ of certiorari. The neighbors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The neighbors, all of whom owned property adjacent to the proposed subdivision, objected to the score assigned to the sewage system proposed by the developer in its application, claiming that such score was erroneous because the zoning administrator assigned the sewer system three land evaluation and site assessment (LESA) points as a central system, rather than eleven LESA points as a private system. Under the LESA system, the lower the total number of points assigned to a component of a proposed project, the more likely the project was to be approved. The neighbors had standing to assert their right to due process. Two board members and the board's attorney should have been disqualified in the proceedings because they had conflicts of interest and, thus, the neighbors did not receive a fair hearing in a fair tribunal. Due process required a neutral and detached judge. Insofar as the disqualification of the board members and attorney required remand for a new hearing, consideration of the circuit court's interpretation of the county zoning ordinance was premature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this environmental class action, defendant company appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Harrison County, West Virginia, which denied defendant's motions for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, to decertify the class; for a new trial; and to vacate or reduce the award of punitive damages. Certain plaintiff class members appealed from orders entered by the circuit court which barred their property damage claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found liable to plaintiffs in the approximate amount of $ 381,737,522 for off-site arsenic, cadmium, and lead contamination which emanated from defendant's zinc smelter facility in Spelter, West Virginia. The instant court found that there was conflicting evidence with respect to when plaintiffs possessed the requisite knowledge to trigger the running of the statute of limitations under the discovery rule and the circuit court erred in failing to have the jury decide this factual issue. Next, the instant court found that there was no error in the circuit court's disposition of each of the elements to be considered in certifying a class under W. Va. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b), and thus class certification was proper. The instant court also found that the trial court properly instructed the jury to consider whether the property class plaintiffs suffered harm to their property. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to repeat this element on the verdict form. Finally, the instant court found that punitive damages may not be awarded on a cause of action for medical monitoring.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The verdict was conditionally affirmed and the case was remanded with directions to the circuit court to conduct a jury trial on the issue of when plaintiffs possessed the requisite knowledge to trigger the running of the statute of limitations. The order granting class certification was affirmed. The punitive damages award was reversed and the case was remanded; plaintiffs must decide whether they would accept a punitive damages remittitur.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court did not err in finding that the named landowner was the only party that properly perfected an appeal. Existing precedent had resolved the issue of the facial constitutionality of W. Va. Code &sect; 11-3-24 as it pertained to the issues of whether the county commission could have impartially sat as the board of equalization and review and the constitutionality of the applicable burden of proof. The landowner failed to advise the appellate court of how it specifically suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged constricted time frame upon appeal. Further, the landowner failed to meet its burden to prove by clear and cogent evidence the requisite facts establishing that the time frame for a tax assessment appeal under &sect; 11-3-24 was so unreasonable or arbitrary as to amount to a denial of due process of law. The circuit court did not err by upholding the tax assessment because the landowner had not sustained its burden of proving that the assessor's valuation was excessive where it did not offer any evidence of the true value of the property. It also failed to show that other such property was intentionally and systematically under valuated.</SPAN></P>

Appellants' motion to dismiss had been denied in the circuit court. The case was before the court on remand from the United States Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court primarily examined whether the forum-selection clause of the 1997 coal supply agreement (CSA) between some of the parties should have been enforced. The court held that determining whether to dismiss a claim based on a forum-selection clause involved a four-part analysis. The first inquiry was whether the clause was reasonably communicated to the party resisting enforcement. The second step required classification of the clause as mandatory or permissive. The third query asked whether the claims and parties involved in the suit were subject to the forum selection clause. The fourth step was to ascertain whether the resisting party had rebutted the presumption of enforceability by making a sufficiently strong showing that enforcement would be unreasonable and unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching. Presented with a mandatory forum-selection clause in the CSA, the court rejected the argument that it did not apply to tort claims. The court found no impediment to applying the new forum-selection clause principles to the parties in the case. Therefore, the court concluded that the circuit court erred in denying the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded for the circuit court to enter an order dismissing, with prejudice, the case against appellants.</SPAN></P>

The group spotted the victim and her husband outside a restaurant. Defendant approached the victim from behind and grabbed her purse. In the process the victim was knocked to the ground where she sustained severe injuries. The appellate court found that the 80-year sentence imposed on defendant did not shock the conscience of the court or society. The purpose for robbing the victim was to steal money to advance yet another illegal act: the purchase and consumption of illegal drugs. This act resulted in three surgeries to the victim and the premature loss of an independent life. The 80-year sentence was not disproportionate when consideration was made of the nature of the offense, defendant's significant past criminal history, and the violence involved in this particular crime. Defendant was the prime mover in that he was the one who actively pursued the plan to prey on the elderly to steal money.</SPAN></P>

The Kanawha County Circuit Court (West Virginia) certified these questions: 1) Was a government official entitled to immediately appeal the denial of a motion for summary judgment that was based on qualified immunity? 2) Were an officer's subjective motives relevant in analyzing the reasonableness of his conduct? 3) Was a supervisor liable for his subordinates' conduct?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff phoned a mental health facility, indicating she was in distress and needed help. Believing that plaintiff intended to harm herself, a facility employee called 911. Police were dispatched to plaintiff's home; she hid in a crawl space. Officers used a police dog and pepper spray to extract her; she alleged that the dog bit her. The trial court denied the chief's summary judgment motion and gave an affirmative response to each of the certified questions. The high court held that 1) denial of a summary judgment motion that was predicated on qualified immunity was subject to immediate appeal under the &quot;collateral order&quot; doctrine; 2) as West Virginia employed an objective test for evaluating official conduct under W.Va. Code &sect; 29-12A-5 (2008), an officer's subjective motivations were irrelevant to determining whether qualified immunity existed in connection with allegations of an unreasonable search and seizure, an unlawful detention, or the use of excessive force; 3) a supervising police officer was not liable for the wrongful actions of his or her subordinate officers in connection with an alleged civil rights violation, but was only liable for his or her own conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to quash an indictment based on the lengthy delay between the alleged criminal offenses and the issuance of the indictment predicated on those offenses. The Circuit Court of Clay County (West Virginia) denied the motion. Defendant sought a writ of prohibition to prevent a criminal jury trial from proceeding, arguing that the delay violated his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. V and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that a hearing was necessary to determine whether defendant could demonstrate that actual prejudice resulted from the delay. In order to maintain that pre-indictment delay violated the Due Process Clause and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10, defendant had to show actual prejudice. Once that showing was made, the trial court had to balance the resulting prejudice against the reasonableness of the delay. The supreme court overruled State ex rel. Leonard v. Hey, 269 S.E.2d 394 (W.Va. 1980) and Hundley v. Ashworth, 181 W.Va. 379, 382 S.E.2d 573 (1989) to the extent that they were inconsistent with its holding. If defendant met his burden of demonstrating actual substantial prejudice, the trial court had to consider the reasons offered by the State for the delay and determine, after weighing the tendered justifications against the demonstrated prejudice, if due process was denied based on the pre-indictment delay. That determination was to be made with reference to whether the action complained of violated those fundamental conceptions of justice that were at the base of civil and political institutions and defined the community's sense of fair play and decency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employee sued appellant employer in the Circuit Court of Boone County (West Virginia), alleging an unlawful retaliatory discharge and refusal to reinstate him by the employer. The jury awarded the employee compensatory and punitive damages. The court entered judgment for the employee and denied the employer's motion for judgment as a matter of law, for a new trial, or to alter or amend the judgment. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the employee sought to return to work after receiving workers' compensation benefits, the employer terminated the employee under a collective bargaining agreement for having had more than two in-excused consecutive days of absence. The employee alleged that his termination was an unlawful retaliatory discharge under W. Va. Code &sect; 23-5A-1 (Repl. Vol. 2005) and that the employer refused to reinstate him as required by W. Va. Code &sect; 23-5A-3(b)  (Repl. Vol. 2005). On appeal, the court found that (1) the employee's claims alleging workers' compensation discrimination under W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 23-5A-1 and 23-5A-39(b) were not preempted by &sect; 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 185; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion because collateral estoppel did not operate to preclude the employee from litigating certain factual issues previously decided by an arbitrator during the grievance proceedings his union brought on his behalf; (3) the employee was entitled to an award of front pay and the evidence supported the amount of front pay the jury awarded; and (4) the employee was entitled to an award of punitive damages, and the award was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant challenged the order of the Workers' Compensation Board of Review (West Virginia), which affirmed prior orders that awarded him a 13 percent permanent partial disability (PPD) award. The claimant was diagnosed as having sustained a lumbosacral strain following a work related injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the claimant argued that he was entitled to a higher impairment rating and should have been awarded an additional percentage of PPD benefits and that the Board erred by upholding his award of benefits because the calculation rule was unconstitutional as violative of the separation of powers doctrine. The court held that the West Virginia Legislature did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by delegating rule-making authority to the Workers' Compensation Board of Managers since via W. Va. Code &sect; 23-4-3b(b) (2005), the Legislature specifically declared its intention to delegate rule-making authority to the Board of Managers for the express purpose of promulgating the rules establishing the process for the medical management of workers' compensation claims and awards. Further, the court held that the promulgation of the Table set forth in W. Va. Code R. &sect; 85-20-C (2004) was a proper exercise of the Board of Managers' rule-making authority delegated by the Legislature in W. Va. Code &sect; 23-4-3b(b) (2005). Since the claimant's PPD award was calculated in accordance with the Table, the court upheld the same.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, deliberate and premeditated. On appeal, defendant's conviction was reversed. Following a second trial, a jury found defendant guilty of murder of the first degree, felony murder. The Circuit Court of Marion County (West Virginia) denied defendant's motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to conclude that the jury's consideration of felony murder at his second trial violated double jeopardy. The issue before the appellate court was whether double jeopardy was violated when defendant, who had been charged with first-degree murder under alternative theories of premeditation and felony murder, was first convicted of premeditated murder with no jury finding as to felony murder, but, upon retrial following reversal of the conviction, was found guilty under the alternative theory of felony murder. The appellate court held that there was no double jeopardy violation. At his first trial, the jury found defendant guilty of deliberate and premeditated first-degree murder, and remained silent as to the alternative theory of felony murder. Because premeditated murder and felony murder were but two alternative theories for establishing first-degree murder, the jury's election of one theory in defendant's first trial did not amount to an implied acquittal of the other theory. Consequently, double jeopardy did not bar the jury's consideration of felony murder in the second trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee sued defendant former employer alleging retaliatory discharge under W. Va. Code &sect; 23-5A-1 (2005) and refusal to reinstate employment under W. Va. Code &sect; 23-5A-3(b) (2005). The trial court denied the employer's motion for summary judgment. As per a jury verdict, the Circuit Court of Boone County (West Virginia) awarded the employee $ 885,107 in compensatory and $ 1 million in punitive damages. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a workers' compensation claim after breaking his wrist at work. When the employee was cleared to return to work he notified a manager. It was not until a week later that the employee was contacted and told report to work in five hours. When the employee could not report that day, he was terminated. Contrary to the employer's contention, the supreme court of appeals concluded that the employee's claims under W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 23-5A-1 and 23-5A-3 were not preempted by federal labor law. Nor was the employee collaterally estopped from litigating whether his discharge constituted an unlawful retaliatory discharge, as a prior proceeding only addressed whether he had violated the collective bargaining agreement. The supreme court of appeals also found that the award of front pay was appropriate and that the employee was not required to mitigate damages given the employer's malicious conduct. Finally, the supreme appellate court concluded that the employee was entitled to punitive damages, noting that the employer placed him under surveillance when a doctor did not approve his return to work and only gave him five hours notice that he was required to report to work.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state health agency filed a petition for writ of prohibition in which it sought to prevent the trial court from taking any action in an underlying mandamus action.

The state supreme court found that the trial court's proposed order, to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding the underlying matter so that the record regarding the alleged problems could be developed accordingly, fell within the trial court's power to ensure that a state agency complied with the legislative mandates. Indeed, the state supreme court specifically found that the trial court had the power to ensure that patients were receiving treatment guaranteed to them under W. Va. Code &sect; 27-5-9 (2007).
