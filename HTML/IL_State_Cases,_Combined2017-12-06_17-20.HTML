</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants in separate cases were charged with aggravated DUI under 625 ILCS 5/11-501(d)(1)(G) and (H) (2006). The Henry County Circuit Court (Illinois) granted their motions to dismiss on the ground that the subsections were not embodied in the statute at the time the offenses were alleged to have been committed. The People appealed, and the cases were consolidated for the purpose of appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subsections were added to the statute by 2005 Ill. Laws 329. The court stated that it appeared that the trial court had found that 2005 Ill. Laws 329 had been superseded by 2005 Ill. Laws 609, which also amended the statute. The court stated that it was convinced that the trial court had not found 2005 Ill. Laws 329 to be unconstitutional, but had found it inoperative based upon principles of statutory construction. The court stated that the law was well settled in favor of harmonizing enactments passed in the same legislative session. Here, the enactments could be harmonized, and the trial court erred in not giving effect to both. The legislature intended to make two distinct changes to the statute. The intent of 2005 Ill. Laws 329 was to add two new offenses to aggravated DUI, whereas 2005 Ill. Laws 609 amended the statute to provide that if a defendant was convicted of aggravated DUI because his DUI was the cause of the death of one or more persons, the defendant would be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, unless the trial court determined that extraordinary circumstances required probation. Thus, the legislative intent of each enactment was not inconsistent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order invalidating the statutory provisions at issue. It remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied appellant state officials' motion to dismiss a Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act (765 ILCS 1025 et seq. (2004)) complaint filed by appellee owners. Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 308 certified questions were: whether retention of interest earned on property held by the State was a taking for which compensation was due, and whether compensation was measured by the interest earned on the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that 765 ILCS 1025/15 was a taking without compensation in violation of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 15; U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV; and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court found that interest was earned on the unclaimed property because the Treasurer had to deposit the money in an authorized bank, savings and loan association or credit union. Therefore, the payment would not be a money judgment against the State because the source of the interest monies would be the institution where the funds were invested. Property remitted to the State under the Act was &quot;presumptively abandoned,&quot; not &quot;abandoned,&quot; and the State acted as a property's custodian, not its owner. Therefore, the Treasurer's argument that abandonment entitled it to the interest generated after it was remitted to the State lacked merit. However, there was no evidence that the owner's property was producing any interest until the Treasurer took possession of it under the Act. The State's gain did not establish a loss on the part of the owners. As such, the owners had no claim for a taking for which compensation was due; having no claim, they could not represent the interests of a class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions in the negative, reversed the order granting certification and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners filed suit against defendants, a city, a commission on landmarks, and city officials, alleging that Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect;&sect; 2-120-580 to 2-120-920 was invalid on its face in violation of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and art. IV, &sect; 1. The owners challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted the motion to dismiss the city, commission, and officials filed under 735 ILCS 5/2-615 (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission recommended certain areas as landmark districts, and the city council designated the areas as such. The owners' properties were in those areas. The appellate court held that the allegations in the owners' complaint that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous were sufficient to establish a cause of action. The terms &quot;value,&quot; &quot;important,&quot; &quot;significant,&quot; and &quot;unique&quot; in Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 2-120-620 (2000) were vague, ambiguous, and overly broad. The city offered no criteria by which a person of common intelligence could determine from the face of the ordinance whether a building or district would be deemed to have value or importance or whether a person would be deemed to have a &quot;special interest&quot; in neighborhood preservation. The owners adequately stated a cause of action in the count of their complaint alleging that the ordinance permitted an improper delegation of authority. The commission performed a declaratory function. Under the ordinance, the commission could make a recommendation to the city council, and the city council was not required to review the commission's recommendations before they became final.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the owners' complaint and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant objectors filed a complaint against appellee coalition in the Illinois State Board of Elections, alleging violations of the campaign disclosure requirements of the Illinois Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/9-1 et seq. (2004). The Board dismissed the complaint. The objectors appealed pursuant to 10 ILCS 5/9-22 (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board's dismissal order was not based on the merits of the complaint, but on the Board's deadlock vote and consequent inability to achieve the statutorily-mandated five-member vote to enable the Board to find the matter to have been filed on justifiable grounds and order a public hearing under 10 ILCS 5/1A-7 and 10 ILCS 5/9-21 (2004). On appeal, the court found that the members of the Board voting to dismiss the complaint did not clearly err in determining that the complaint was not filed on justifiable grounds. The court also rejected the objectors' constitutional arguments that the Board's deadlock vote violated the objectors' rights to meaningful judicial review and protection against arbitrary government actions. Accordingly, the Board failed to determine that the complaint was filed on justifiable grounds when it voted four-to-four on that question. The Board, therefore, complied with the clear directive of &sect; 9-21 by dismissing the complaint after failing to determine that it was filed on justifiable grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which made a second-stage dismissal of his supplemental postconviction petition, filed under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 ILCS 5/122-1 (2002) et seq. Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first-degree murder, and home invasion. The case was transferred to the criminal courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder convictions and lesser concurrent terms on the others. On appeal of the underlying judgment, defendant, relying on specific case law, asserted that the mandatory sentence of natural life in prison, as applied to himself, a 14-year-old juvenile convicted based on an accountability theory, was unconstitutional. The court held that the case law relied upon by defendant did not prohibit the imposition of a natural life sentence for all juveniles or for all juveniles convicted based on a theory of accountability. The court held that the case was fact specific and did not create a new substantive rule warranting retroactive application. The court found no merit to defendant's contention that the indictment did not place him on notice that he faced the possibility of a mandatory natural life sentence as the State did not charge him with a higher classification of murder because of a prior conviction, therefore, the State was not required to notify him of the sentence he would receive upon conviction. The court further held that retained postconviction counsel satisfied the requirements of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said Rivera, holding partial summary dismissal of a postconviction petition was error, let him seek postconviction review, as his first postconviction petition was partially summarily dismissed. The appellate court disagreed. The partial summary dismissal of his first petition was affirmed over three years before Rivera was issued, which stated a new rule that did not apply retroactively to defendant's successive petition, since, before Rivera, Illinois' lower courts disagreed as to the propriety of partial summary dismissals of postconviction petitions. Rivera's reliance on prior appellate court decisions did not show it did not state a new rule, so it could not be retroactively applied to invalidate the partial summary dismissal of defendant's first petition, and he could not use it to meet the required &quot;prejudice&quot; prong of 725 ILCS 5/122-1(f) (2004) to obtain leave to file his successive petition. He could not base his petition on a freestanding actual innocence claim because he presented no supporting new evidence and made this claim in his first petition, merely contesting his plea's voluntariness without contesting whether he committed the underlying crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Illinois filed a complaint against appellee supply company owner in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), for violations of the Illinois Oil and Gas Act, 225 ILCS 725/1 through 28.1 (2006). The trial court granted the owner's motion for change of venue under 735 ILCS 5/2-101 (2006), or, in the alternative, to transfer on the basis of forum non conveniens. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Illinois alleged that the owner violated orders and a final administrative decision by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources regarding oil production and injection wells. The State also indicted that venue was appropriate in Sangamon County based on the Department's issuance of final administrative decisions to the owner in that county. The owner contended that venue was proper in White County. On appeal, the court found that the specific venue provision of &sect; 11 of the Illinois Oil and Gas Act, 225 ILCS 725/1 through 28.1 (2006), was the applicable venue provision, and thus Sangamon County was a proper venue under 225 ILCS 725/11 (2006). However, because part of the subject land and some of the activity was in White County, that county was also a proper place of venue for the entire action under &sect; 11. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by transferring the case to White County under the doctrine of forum non conveniens because, considering the totality of the circumstances and all of the relevant factors, the inconvenience of Sangamon County greatly outweighed the State's venue choice and a transfer to White County was strongly favored.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed appellant City's third-party complaint against appellees, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) and its former secretary, finding that sovereign immunity barred relief and that the complaint did not state a claim. The City appealed, claiming in part, that the State consented to suit based on the Illinois Environmental Protection (EP) Act, 415 ILCS 5/1 et seq. (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A matter of first impression was presented as to whether the EP Act contained an exception to sovereign immunity. The court found that the EP Act conferred a liberal grant of authority for suits against those alleged to have harmed or compromised the environment. There was nothing unclear, contradictory or in conflict between or among the EP Act, the State Lawsuit Immunity Act, 745 ILCS 5/1, and the Court of Claims Act, 705 ILCS 505/1 et seq. The EP Act's use of the phrase &quot;may sue&quot; as to third parties did not confer jurisdiction in any forum or evince legislative intent mandating that the EP Act contradict, override, or supercede the other Acts regarding jurisdiction. The State did not consent to be sued under the EP Act; nor did it waive sovereign immunity, vesting a circuit court with jurisdiction. The interplay of the EP Act with the other Acts guided the conclusion that dismissal was proper for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Dismissal as to IDOT applied equally to the secretary. There was no inequity in requiring the City to seek relief in the court of claims. A traditional reluctance of that court to grant injunctive relief was not tantamount to its unavailability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of DuPage County (Illinois) convicted defendant of driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.08 or more, a violation of 625 ILCS 5/11-501(a)(1) (2004). On appeal, defendant argued that: (1) the State did not lay a proper foundation for admitting the blood test results; (2) the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, &sect; 1286.40; and (3) he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed the interpretation of 625 ILCS 5/11-501.4 de novo and found that the trial court's ruling that the State satisfied the foundational requirements to admit defendant's blood test was not an abuse of discretion. Defendant received emergency medical treatment, and the blood test was ordered in the ordinary course of providing the medical treatment, rather than at the request of law enforcement; and in the normal course of business, the hospital's lab tested all blood, defendant's blood test results looked like they came from that lab, and the results were entered in his chart shortly after he arrived at the hospital. The Department of State Police was authorized to pass Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, &sect; 1286.40, subjecting blood serum test results to a particular conversion factor. Because the Department intended to prescribe a valid regulation, the court construed the phrase &quot;will be&quot; as permissive rather than mandatory, rendering the regulation constitutional and permitting the trial court to take judicial notice of the regulation. Based on the foregoing, defendant's sufficiency of the evidence argument failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate pled guilty to eight acts of home invasion, one residential burglary, four aggravated criminal sexual assaults, and five attempted aggravated criminal sexual assaults, and was sentenced. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) then denied the inmate's motion to withdraw his plea, and summarily dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief against appellee State pursuant to 725 ILCS 5/122-1 (2004). The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate first argued that four of his sentences exceeded the statutory maximum for his offenses, and that the sentence terms in excess of the statutory maximum were void. The State conceded the merit of the inmate's arguments regarding these sentences. The inmate also asserted that two home invasion convictions for a single break-in was an unconstitutional violation of the one-act, one-crime rule. The appellate court found that the inmate's petition was sufficiently specific to communicate the legal principles supporting his constitutional claim, and rejected the State's claim that its lack of detail was a proper basis for its dismissal. Since the inmate's prior summary proceeding in the appellate court addressing Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d) compliance was the equivalent of filing no appeal, he did not forfeit post-conviction review of his allegations of violation of the one-act, one-crime principle. The petition made a sufficient allegation of a deprivation of constitutional rights to survive first-stage review under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 ILCS 5/122-1 (2004). Accordingly, the petition was neither frivolous nor patently without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the petition was reversed and the entire petition was remanded for further proceedings under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. The sentences imposed in three of the cases were reduced to 30 years, and the sentence in a fourth case was reduced to 60 years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with offenses including unlawful possession of a controlled substance (a substance containing cocaine) (720 ILCS 570/402(c) (2006)) arising out of an incident and the trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress, finding police officers entered defendant's home on the basis of an invalid warrant and without consent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State conceded that defendant's arrest on an inactive warrant violated the Fourth Amendment, but argued that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule should apply. The appeals court found that the State failed to meet its burden of proof that the good-faith exception of 725 ILCS 5/114-12(b)(1) (2006) should apply, and that exclusion was the proper remedy. The case involved a situation where the officers knowingly obtained an up-to-three-day-old list and did not verify the continued validity of defendant's warrant, even though their standard police procedure was to obtain a current list. The officers provided no explanation during their testimony why they accepted an old list, failed to request a newer list, and failed to verify the continued validity of the warrants on the list. The State also argued that exigent circumstances justified officers' warrantless entry into defendant's residence. However, the record was devoid of any facts supporting an officer's concern for safety, and the record was devoid of any indication that the officers had probable cause to believe defendant committed or was committing an offense. The motion to suppress was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Construction problems led plaintiff condominium association to sue defendant builder. The builder filed a third-party complaint against third-party defendant subcontractor. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied the subcontractor's motion to dismiss the third-party complaint as untimely, but later granted the subcontractor's motion to certify for immediate appeal two questions concerning the interpretation of 735 ILCS 5/13-204 (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that a failure to comply with 735 ILCS 5/13-217 (1994) was not fatal, because 735 ILCS 5/13-204 provided another opportunity to file an action. However, in order to do so, the party seeking to proceed with a claim under 735 ILCS 5/13-204 had to comply with the limitations periods under both 735 ILCS 5/13-204(b) and (c). In addition, a defendant could not file a timely action for contribution or indemnity under 735 ILCS 5/13-204 unless the plaintiff in the underlying action could have, at the time it sued the defendant, filed a timely action against the parties from whom the defendant sought contribution or indemnity. In the instant case, the third-party complaint was untimely, under 735 ILCS 5/13-204(c), because when the association sued the builder, the time had expired for the association to file a timely complaint against the subcontractor. Thus, the builder was barred from suing the subcontractor for contribution or indemnity because the builder did not satisfy both limitations of 735 ILCS 5/13-204(b), (c). Also, a standstill agreement in which the subcontractor did not participate could not affect its rights as protected by 735 ILCS 5/13-204(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified questions were answered, the order of the trial court denying the subcontractor's motion to dismiss was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions to dismiss as untimely the builder's third-party complaint against the subcontractor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a village and its residents, sued defendant city in the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) for declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the city's acquisition of village property, for common-law fraud and unjust enrichment, for a claim that a village ordinance governed certain demolitions, and for public nuisance. After temporarily granting an injunction, the trial court dismissed the complaint. The plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city acquired village land to expand its airport. The appellate court held it was no abuse of discretion to dismiss, under 735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(3) (2006), a claim that the city did not show acquiring the land was necessary because this was pending before another judge, as to plaintiffs' property, and they did not show they could intervene as to other land, nor could they attack condemnation judgments as to those properties. A request to declare a village ordinance governed any demolition was dismissed under &sect; 2-619 because state law preempted the ordinance. A fraud claim was dismissed under 735 ILCS 5/2-615 (2006) because no influence of plaintiffs by misrepresentations to third parties or physical harm were alleged. An unjust enrichment claim was dismissed because it did not say how acquiring other owners' property denied plaintiffs a benefit. The trial court erred in dissolving a preliminary injunction because it was not shown that agency oversight was an adequate alternative to an injunction. The trial court also erred in relying on administrative authority because no agency involvement was shown, and an administrative remedy did not relieve a court of its judicial function.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's dismissal, with prejudice, of plaintiffs' complaint was affirmed, but the trial court's termination of a preliminary injunction was reversed, and the matter was remanded to reanalyze the propriety of injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) of two counts of forgery, under 720 ILCS 5/17-3(a)(1) and (2) (2006), and one count of deceptive practices, under 720 ILCS 5/17-1(B)(d) (2006), and his postconviction petition, under 725 ILCS 5/122-1 et seq. (2006), was dismissed. He appealed his convictions and the dismissal of his petition, and the appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said counsel ineffectively conceded his guilt of forgery. The appellate court disagreed because he could have been convicted of theft and forgery, as forgery required proof of (1) making a fake check or (2) issuing the check knowing it was fake, while theft required proof he knowingly obtained control over property by deception, 720 ILCS 5/16-1(a)(2) (2006), so conceding guilt of forgery did not fail to subject the State's theft case to adversarial testing. The one-act, one-crime rule required vacating his deceptive practices conviction because it was based on the same act as his forgery convictions, but separate forgery convictions for creating and delivering a fake check were not barred. One charge required proof of making the check purportedly by another or with the authority of one who gave no such authority, while the other charge required proof of issuing the check knowing it was fake. Defendant did each act, supporting separate convictions. It was no error to dismiss his postconviction petition for mootness, since he could raise his claims in the appeal he was allowed to file, as mootness and res judicata were closely related.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's forgery convictions were affirmed, but his deceptive practices conviction was vacated, and the matter was remanded for resentencing based on the proper convictions. The first-stage dismissal of defendant's postconviction petition was affirmed. Because he was convicted of two forgery counts, but sentenced for one forgery count and one theft count, the discrepancy was to be reconciled and defendant resentenced accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order entered by the Circuit Court of Jersey County (Illinois), which denied reinstatement of defendant's pro se petition filed pursuant to the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 ILCS 5/122-1 through 122-8 (1998), after it had been previously dismissed on a voluntary basis without prejudice. Defendant had been convicted of first-degree murder under 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1) (1995).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court determined three allegations in the original petition were of concern, it appointed counsel to represent defendant. However, counsel sought a voluntary dismissal without prejudice after finding no colorable arguments but sought leave to refile if appropriate evidence became available. The trial court denied defendant's request for reinstatement of his petition nine months later. On appeal, the court reversed. While the court did not decide whether defendant's right to reinstatement was absolute, under 725 ILCS 5/122-5 (2006), the trial court had the authority to permit pleading over or the filing of further pleadings, including a post-conviction petition. Whether reinstatement was mandatory or an act of discretion, defendant was entitled to reinstatement under the circumstances because if appointed counsel felt that the arguments lacked merit, he could have sought to withdraw as opposed to dismissing the petition; counsel apparently did not give defendant the option of proceeding pro se. Additionally, the request for reinstatement was within the one-year time period that applied under 735 ILCS 5/13-217 (2006) to the refiling of complaints in civil cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

In an attached affidavit, the patient's attorney asserted that he was unable to obtain the medical consultation required by 735 ILCS 5/2-622(a)(1) (2006), because the statute of limitations would hinder the action and, thus, he needed a 90-day extension. Thereafter, the patient requested another extension of time to obtain certain medical record. Instead, the trial court granted the two doctors' motion to dismiss based on the patient not declaring pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-622(a)(2) that she had not previously voluntarily dismissed the action and granted the hospital's motion to dismiss based on res judicata because the patient had voluntarily dismissed her action and had not replead it. The appellate court found that under the version of 735 ILCS 5/2-622(a)(2) in effect, the patient was not required to make that declaration and res judicata did not apply to an action voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioner inmate's armed robbery convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois) dismissed the inmate's Post-Conviction Hearing Act (725 ILCS 5/122-1 through 122-8 (2006)) petition and  the warden conducted a 730 ILCS 5/3-6-3(d) (2006) hearing and revoked the inmate's good time credit for having filed a frivolous petition, a violation of Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, &sect; 504. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the postconviction relief petition failed to state the gist of a constitutional violation and was properly dismissed as frivolous and without merit. There was no violation of confrontation rights under U.S. Const., amend. VI and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, nor ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because 1) a witness's statements about a conversation with a nontestifying witness did not include testimony as to the armed robber's identity, 2) the statements were not inadmissible hearsay or violative of the Confrontation Clause, and 3) counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to raise a nonexistent Confrontation Clause issue. Because armed robbery was not included in 740 ILCS 45/2(c) (2004), the proper amount of a fine assessed was $ 20 pursuant to 725 ILCS 240/10(c)(2) (2004); but, because the imposition of the fine was a judicial function beyond the authority of the circuit clerk, the fine imposed by a clerk had to be vacated. 730 ILCS 5/3-6-3(d) furthered a valid State interest in ensuring that its courts were not overburdened with frivolous suits. The inmate did not exhaust administrative remedies before seeking relief from the warden's action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant candidate sought review of a decision entered by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which effectively affirmed a decision by appellee, the Illinois State Board of Elections (SBOE), sitting as the State Officers Electoral Board (SOEB), to invalidate the candidate's nominating papers after appellee objector had made objections based on the number of signatures obtained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate, who was a member of the Libertarian party, claimed, inter alia, that the requirements of 10 ILCS 5/10-2, 10-8 (2006) violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights and rights under Ill.

While the rights to vote and to associate were fundamental, the State was permitted to impose reasonable restrictions on access to the ballot and had a duty to ensure the electoral process was orderly. The minimum signature requirements in 10 ILCS 5/10-2 for a new party formed in a district were not unconstitutional as the State had a legitimate interest in only putting candidates on the ballot who demonstrated a measurable quantum of support or a level of political viability. The signature requirements were not illusory based on the candidate's claim that they could only be enforced when objections were filed under 10 ILCS 5/10-8 because that provision's plain language indicated that two conditions precedent had to be met before the nominating papers would be deemed valid: the papers had to be filed with the proper election authority under 10 ILCS 5/10-6 and in apparent conformity with the Election Code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a joint bench trial, the trial court granted defendant's motion for a directed verdict on a criminal drug conspiracy charge and found defendant guilty of official misconduct. The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, sentenced defendant to 24 months' probation and 250 hours of community service. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in finding that the State proved that she violated a law, as required for a conviction for official misconduct under 720 ILCS 5/33-3(b) (1998). Defendant, who worked as police dispatcher, argued that the nature of the law she allegedly violated when she communicated information about police activity to a codefendant was simply a rule from an employee manual and not a law as envisioned by the legislature in its enactment of &sect; 33-3(b). The appellate court disagreed. The subject rule was more than a mere rule of employment, but was a village ordinance by a home rule community. The trial court found incredible defendant's claims that she made up the information imparted to a codefendant rather than disseminated confidential information. The appellate court also concluded that &sect; 33-3(b) was not unconstitutional, but clearly prohibited public officers from knowingly performing, in their official capacity, an action known to be forbidden by law. Nor was the law vague, as a person of ordinary intelligence would not have to guess that calling a drug dealer to inform him where police were gathering and conducting surveillance was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried with three co-defendants and found guilty of criminal drug conspiracy, five counts of delivery of more than 100 but less than 400 grams of cocaine, one count of possession of more than 900 grams of cocaine with intent to deliver, and one count of possession of 1 to 15 grams of cocaine with intent to deliver. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced him to concurrent 20 year terms in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court first concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a wiretap order because the affidavits appended in support of the application showed that other normal investigative procedures, such as use of a confidential informant and garbage seizures, had been tried and failed, appeared unlikely to succeed if tried, or were too dangerous. The appellate court also found no abuse of discretion in the extension orders, as the evidence showed that the calls initially intercepted were insufficient to support the conspiracy charge. The State's violation of 725 ILCS 5/108B-9 (1998) did not necessitate a new trial, as the investigator's voice identification did not rest solely on defendant's admission that it was his voice on the tape but was also based on having listened to the tapes and recognizing defendant's voice. The appellate court also found that evidence that defendant and another agreed to deliver controlled substances, had been transacting business in a standardized manner, and had numerous conversations with the other about the availability and price of drugs was sufficient to support defendant's criminal drug conspiracy conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) adjudicated respondent juvenile a delinquent minor, finding him guilty of criminal sexual assault and attempted robbery, and sentencing him to an indeterminate term to automatically terminate upon the passage of 15 years or respondent attaining the age of 21. Respondent appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent argued that the State failed to prove him guilty of criminal sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt because the victim was not a credible witness and the trial court's judgment as to her credibility was not reasonable. The appellate court found that the trial court thoroughly considered the evidence and made a well-reasoned determination as to credibility. Both the victim's account and respondent's account contained inconsistencies and the trial court's finding was not so unreasonable, improbable, or unsatisfactory to justify a reasonable doubt as to respondent's guilt. Respondent also argued that the trial court violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by having him shackled without a hearing on necessity. The appellate court found the issue waived, and further determined that the claim lacked merit because the evidence was not closely balanced and the error was not so serious it affected the fairness of the trial or the integrity of the judicial process. Finally, the appellate court concluded that 705 ILCS 405/5-101(3) (2004) was not unconstitutional because it denied juveniles charged with sex offenses the right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) against defendant Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, to enjoin disbursement of funds for stem cell research mandated by two executive orders of the Governor of Illinois. The trial court dismissed the lawsuit and ruled that the lawsuit was a nonjusticiable political question, inappropriate for judicial determination. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor issued Executive Order 2005-06 creating the Illinois Regenerative Institute for Stem Cell Research which directed the Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health to create an entity to be known as the Illinois Regenerative Medical Institute (IRMI). IRMI was to develop a program which would award grants and loans to medical research facilities for the development of cures based on stem cell research. The taxpayer sought leave to file a taxpayer complaint against the Director only. The taxpayer alleged that Executive Orders 2005-06 and 2006-03 were unconstitutional. The appellate court held it was not possible to grant the taxpayer the relief requested as the court could not prevent what has already been done. The taxpayer had not properly alleged a declaratory judgment action challenging the Governor's authority and the court would have no power to make that declaration. The Director was not the appropriate defendant. As neither the Comptroller, the Treasurer, or the recipients of the grants were named as defendants, the trial court could not grant the taxpayer the relief sought. As the appellate court could not grant the relief sought, the appeal was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted in 2000 on drug charges under 720 ILCS 570/401(d) (2000), 720 ILCS 570/407. Based on defendant's six prior felony convictions, the State argued that defendant should be sentenced to a mandatory Class X prison sentence under 730 ILCS 5/5-5-3(c)(8) (2000); however, the trial court did not address that argument and sentenced defendant to 24 months' probation. In 2001, the State filed a petition for violation of probation based on defendant's arrest for attempted armed robbery and attempted murder; defendant was found guilty in 2005, but the convictions were reversed in 2007 after a violation of probation was found. Defendant argued that his probation violation should be vacated, and the State claimed that probation was a void sentence. The court vacated defendant's probation as it was a void sentence based on defendant's prior convictions and could be attacked at any time, either directly or collaterally. Defendant's probation period was tolled by the filing of the State's petition under 730 ILCS 5/5-6-4(a) (2000). The remand for resentencing did not constituted double jeopardy as probation was not punishment in the same sense as imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) disposed of a multicount declaratory judgment action challenging the format and language on an upcoming election ballot for the calling of a constitutional convention by ordering that a &quot;corrective notice&quot; to the ballot be issued.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Constitution required that Illinois ask its voters at specified intervals about whether a state constitutional convention should be held. That question was slated to be on the ballot at the upcoming general election. However, the question was worded inaccurately. The bar association, as well as other plaintiffs, filed a multicount declaratory judgment action challenging the question. The trial court, rather than order corrections to the ballot itself, directed defendant state officials to issue a &quot;corrective notice&quot; to be distributed to voters along with the ballot. The appellate court found that the &quot;corrective notice&quot; guaranteed that each voter had a clear opportunity to express his choice either for or against holding a state constitutional convention, and, thus, fulfilled the requirement of Ill. Const. art. III, &sect; 3 that elections be &quot;free and equal.&quot; It also found that the bar association and other plaintiffs had not shown that the requirement that the &quot;corrective notice&quot; be on a &quot;separate ballot&quot; meant a ballot physically distinct from the general ballot instead of the trial court's remedy of that notice being on a separate part of the general ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Boone County (Illinois), in four separate cases, entered final judgments of conviction against four defendants for aggravated driving under the influence, in violation of 625 ILCS 5/11-501(d)(1)(G) (2006), for driving while intoxicated and while not licensed by Illinois to drive. It then sentenced each defendant to probation and ordered each to pay certain fines. Defendants appealed; their appeals were then consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The four defendants in separate cases were convicted of aggravated driving under the influence (DUI), in violation of 625 ILCS 5/11-501(d)(1)(G) (2006), for driving while intoxicated and while not licensed by Illinois to drive. The four defendants received probation and were ordered to pay certain fines. On appeal, the four defendants argued that 625 ILCS 5/11-501(d)(1)(G) (2006) was not in effect at the time of their offenses. Accordingly, they requested that their convictions be reduced to DUI. Alternatively, they claimed they were entitled to monetary credit against their fines for time in pre-sentencing custody, pursuant to 725 ILCS 5/110-14 (2004). The appellate court found that two amendatory acts passed after 625 ILCS 5/11-501(d)(1)(G) (2006) went into effect did not involve material inconsistent with that statute and, thus, did not repeal it; rather, the appellate court found, the statute and the two amendatory acts could all be read together. However, it agreed with the four defendants that they were entitled to $ 5 per day sentence credits pursuant to 725 ILCS 5/110-14 (2004) and remanded the cases for a determination of the monetary credit owed in each case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgments of conviction as to each defendant. It then ordered that the cases be remanded to the trial court to determine the amount of time each of the four defendants spent in custody and to grant the appropriate amount of credit against each defendant's fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted by the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) of armed robbery under 720 ILCS 5/18-2(a)(1) (2002), and was sentenced. The convictions and sentences were affirmed. The inmate's postconviction petition was dismissed as patently without merit. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that to survive a first-stage dismissal of a postconviction petition the inmate had to allege the gist of a constitutional claim. The inmate's sole claim was that he did not receive the effective assistance of appellate counsel because counsel failed to argue the State failed to prove that he possessed a dangerous weapon. The inmate's possession of a weapon could be inferred from circumstantial evidence. A detective stated the inmate told him he took the pepper spray with him into the bank in case he needed to use the spray on the tellers. The inmate denied saying this and maintained he did not take the pepper spray into the bank, but the jury believed the detective. The can of pepper spray was found on the inmate when he was apprehended shortly after the robbery. The inmate possessed the pepper spray during the robbery. It could be inferred the inmate knew the can of pepper spray actually contained pepper spray from the fact the inmate confessed the he intended to use it to spray in the tellers' faces to debilitate them, if necessary. The pepper spray was a dangerous weapon under the armed-robbery statute. Appellate counsel was not ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The State was awarded a $ 50 statutory assessment as costs of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which adjudicated her delinquent for the offense of aggravated battery, 720 ILCS 5/12-4(a) and (b)(8) (2004), sentenced her to five years probation, and ordered her to submit a saliva sample for DNA indexing under 730 ILCS 5/5-4-3(f) (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with beating a victim. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in rejecting defendant's claim of self-defense. The severity of the victim's injuries, contrasted with the few abrasions defendant sustained, manifestly supported the trial court's finding that defendant's use of force was unreasonable and excessive. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding testimony concerning defendant's reputation because no evidence was offered to show that the testimony was based on contact with individuals who were defendant's neighbors and associates. Because there was one adjudication of delinquency, and the dispositional order did not reflect that the probation was based on multiple offenses, the one-act, one-crime principle had no application. Defendant did not show that 730 ILCS 5/5-4-3(f) was invalid. One database was used to identify or exclude potential suspects or offenders and for random statistical probability calculations. The science of DNA &quot;fingerprinting&quot; to obtain the profiles transmitted and included within the single database did not use those portions of a subject's DNA that coded for genetic characteristics.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court but modified the term of defendant's probation and supervision to terminate on her twenty-first birthday, June 20, 2010.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pro se defendant was charged with driving under the influence of drugs, in violation of 625 ILCS 5/11-501(a)(4) (2006), and his license was summarily suspended for refusing or failing to submit to drug testing, pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/11-501.1 (2006). The Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County, Illinois granted his motion to rescind the summary suspension of his driver's license. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition to rescind the summary suspension because the police did not have reasonable grounds to stop defendant's vehicle. On appeal, the State contended that the trial court erred by denying its motion for directed finding. The State argued that defendant failed to establish a prima facie case for recision by failing to put forward any evidence that the roadside safety check was invalid. Defendant had not filed an appellee brief. Defendant was stopped pursuant to a roadside safety check. While the roadblock was considered a seizure, it was not a per se violation of the Fourth Amendment. In order to successfully establish a prima facie case for recision, defendant needed to show some evidence that the roadblock was not reasonable. Defendant did not produce any such evidence. Thus, the county circuit court's decision denying the State's motion for a directed finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the county circuit court was reversed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit, Tazewell County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to four concurrent 30-year prison terms for these offenses. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that three of his home invasion convictions and sentences should be vacated under the one-act, one-crime principles. The State argued that defendant forfeited or waived that argument by failing to raise the issue in the trial court. Although defendant failed to raise the issue before the trial court, the appellate court concluded that plain error review was warranted because the one-act, one-crime rule was used to enforce the double jeopardy prohibition against multiple punishments. The State also argued that defendant waived or forfeited his one-act, one-crime argument by entering a guilty plea. The appellate court disagreed, declining to assume that defendant voluntarily and knowingly pled guilty to improper excess convictions, without something in the record suggesting that he voluntarily relinquished a known right by agreeing to those impermissible excess convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence for 3 counts of armed robbery (720 ILCS 5/18-2(a)(1) (2002)) were affirmed on direct appeal. Because defendant admitted he robbed a bank, the court only had to determine whether he did so with a &quot;dangerous weapon.&quot; Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant possessed pepper spray during the robbery. The fact that he did not use it was immaterial. The statute required only that he was armed with a dangerous weapon. It could have been inferred that defendant knew the can actually contained pepper spray from the fact he confessed to a detective that he intended to use it to spray in the tellers' faces to debilitate them if necessary. Accordingly, the court concluded that the pepper spray was a dangerous weapon under the armed-robbery statute. Because defendant's underlying claim that the State did not prove he committed the robbery while possessing a &quot;dangerous weapon&quot; was without merit, appellate counsel was not ineffective on that basis and the trial court properly dismissed defendant's postconviction petition at the first stage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to revoke her probation.

The appellate court further concluded that the pleading filed by the probation officer was valid ab initio because the probation officer lacked authority to file the pleading. The pleading amounted to law practice and the probation officer lacked a law license; thus, the probation officer's actions not only constituted the unauthorized practice of law but also usurped the statutory prerogative of the state's attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant sought workers' compensation benefits under the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act (ILWCA), 820 ILCS 305/1 et seq. Appellee Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission affirmed an arbitrator's decision that the employee could proceed under the ILWCA or the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq. The Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois) set aside the decision. The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the claim under the ILWCA was preempted by the LHWCA. The claimant argued that his case fell within the twilight zone and was, therefore, subject to concurrent jurisdiction. The appellate court reviewed whether there was jurisdiction under the LHWCA and the ILWCA de novo as the facts essential to the inquiry were undisputed. The claimant was eligible for coverage under the pre-1972 version of the LHWCA where, by exclusion, he qualified as an employee under 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 902(3), his injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, his employer had at least one worker engaged in maritime employment, and his injury occurred upon navigable waters of the United States. However, there was no jurisdiction under the ILWCA because this was not a doubtful case. At the time of his injury, the claimant was removing hazardous material from the bottom of the ship before it was placed in dry dock for repair; he was engaged in an activity that was an integral part of and essential to ship repair, a traditional maritime activity. The claimant also did not fall within the maritime but local doctrine. Thus, the Commission lacked jurisdiction to hear the claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment setting aside the Commission's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that respondents crafted a more precise argument when they alleged that a resolution did not reflect the true date of a District Committee meeting. Respondents' objection to the occurrence of the meeting included the objection pertaining to the true date of the meeting. Respondents did not waive under 10 ILCS 5/10-8 (2006) their ability to challenge the sufficiency of the papers for the candidate's failure to include the true date of her nomination. 10 ILCS 5/7-61 (2006) was a mandatory provision, and the date requirement was not reclassified from mandatory to directory. The notary incorrectly wrote the date of April 6, 2008, in the jurats on the resolution and the statement of candidacy. There was no evidence of bad-faith noncompliance. The candidate's resolution was facially valid, and both the true date of selection and the incorrect date fell within all statutory time constraints. The notary affixed a date to the resolution, albeit the incorrect date. But for the scrivener's error, the resolution complied in every mandatory aspect of &sect; 7-61. The error did not impair the integrity of the electoral process, and &sect; 7-61 was substantially followed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child resulted from an affair between cross-appellant father and cross-appellant wife of cross-appellant husband, the father brought a parentage action, and the husband and wife brought an adoption action. In consolidated appeals, including a case remanded from the Illinois Supreme Court, the father and the husband and wife cross-appealed various orders of the Circuit Court for the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County, Illinois.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DNA testing established that the father was the biological father of the child, and the parties disputed whether the parentage and adoption cases were properly consolidated, whether a stay of adoption case pending appeal was properly denied, whether the husband was properly ordered to undergo DNA testing, and whether the father's petition to establish a parent-child relationship and visitation rights was properly denied. The appellate court first held that the parentage and adoption actions were properly consolidated since they both concerned the parentage of the child and shared common parties and facts, and a stay of the adoption proceedings was warranted since the consequences of the adoption action could potentially deprive the father of his rights as the child's biological father. Further, by filing a declaration of parentage in the paternity action, the husband put his physical condition at issue and was properly found in contempt for refusing to submit to DNA testing. Also, the determination of the father's parentage necessarily established a parent-child relationship, and denial of the relationship and visitation based on the best interests of the child was impermissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's orders were affirmed in part with regard to consolidation and compelling DNA testing, but the orders were reversed in part with regard to denial of the father's petition to establish a parent-child relationship and denial of a stay pending appeal, and proceedings in the adoption action were vacated and the cases were remanded for a hearing on the father's visitation request and to reinstate the father in the adoption action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review following a proceeding in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), where he was adjudicated delinquent of aggravated criminal sexual assault and sentenced to five years of probation. As a result of the adjudication, appellant was classified as a &quot;sexual predator&quot; pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), 730 ILCS 150/1 et seq. (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sexual predator classification meant that appellant would be required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. The evidence was sufficient to establish that appellant committed an act of sexual penetration beyond a reasonable doubt under 720 ILCS 5/12-12(f) (2004) as even slight contact was sufficient to establish penetration. Testimony from the victim as well as admissions made by appellant in a handwritten statement provided the necessary evidence. Appellant argued that 705 ILCS 405/5-101(3) (2004), which denied minors the right to a jury trial except in certain circumstances, deprived him of due process due to the consequences imposed on appellant under SORA. The appellate court disagreed. The registration requirements under SORA did not deprive appellant of a liberty interest. Thus, there was no due process violation. Further, even if appellant had established a liberty interest, he received all of the process that he was due. Juvenile proceedings were not criminal prosecutions within the meaning and reach of the Sixth Amendment, so due process did not require a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court granted the developers' motion for a de novo hearing, the court certified two questions of law on the standard of review, interlocutory review was allowed under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 308, and a defendant's petition for leave to appeal was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A certified question asked if the permit's denial was subject to de novo review under 55 ILCS 5/5-12012.1 (2006) as a legislative decision rather than review under the Administrative Review Law, 735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq. (2006) as an administrative or quasi-judicial decision. The appellate court held 55 ILCS 5/5-12012.1 (2006) did not apply to the denial because it plainly applied only to judicial review of the granting of a permit. It did not violate separation of powers because its removal of certain zoning decisions from the purview of the Administrative Review Law, 735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq. (2006), did not exceed the legislature's authority, nor did language invoking de novo judicial review as a legislative decision, so courts were given neither too much nor too little power. The statute's prescribed review for arbitrariness as a matter of substantive due process deferred to agency decision making because a court intervened only when there was no rational basis for a contested decision, and any new evidence presented had to bear on review for arbitrariness as a matter of substantive due process. Since the statute did not apply, the second certified question was not answered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first certified question was answered in the negative, and the second question was not answered. The matter was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff condominium buyers brought suit against defendant builders, alleging violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 ILCS 505/1 et seq. (1996), and other claims. After a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), plaintiffs were awarded nominal damages on their breach of contract and consumer fraud claims, attorney fees, and punitive damages. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants indicated that plaintiffs' units would have nine-foot ceilings, but the ceilings were 8 feet 6 inches. Plaintiffs' units closed in 1997, but plaintiffs' expert testified as to comparable values in 2004. Because of the seven-year difference, the court held that the trial court did not err in finding that the expert's figures did not represent fair market value. Because plaintiffs failed to provide a proper basis to compute their damages, the trial court did not err in awarding only nominal damages. The trial court properly awarded punitive damages under 815 ILCS 505/10a(a) (1996) based on intentional conduct. The evidence showed that defendants knew at least one year before closing that the ceilings would not be the promised height, but never told plaintiffs this. The $300,000 in punitive damages was not grossly excessive under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, given defendants' intentional conduct, the fact that $83,000 in attorney fees were awarded, and the fact that 815 ILCS 505/7 (1996) authorized civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation; here, defendants had committed numerous violations of the Act. The amount of attorney fees was not error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, a county electoral board and its members, appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which reversed the board's decision to exclude petitioner candidate from the November 2008 ballot as the Democratic candidate for senator for an Illinois legislative district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the candidate voted as a Republican in the 2008 primary, under the statement of candidacy portion of he 10 ILCS 5/7-10 (2006), he could not run as a Democrat in the general election. Under &sect; 7-10, only a &quot;qualified primary voter&quot; of the party to which a nominating petition related could be a candidate in the general election. Thus, to run as a Democrat, the candidate was required to have voted as a Democrat in the preceding primary. Because the candidate voted as a Republican in the primary, he was &quot;locked&quot; as a Republican primary voter until the next primary. While he could then switch parties, and become a Democrat primary voter, the next primary would not occur until 2010. The Sperling decision did not require a contrary ruling. Although portions of &sect; 7-10 had been found unconstitutional in Sperling, a post-Sperling amendment to &sect; 7-10 in 1990, while removing the offending party switching language, left intact the restriction on party-changing found in the statement of candidacy portion of &sect; 7-10. That specific language had never itself been deemed unconstitutional and was viable even in light of Sperling.</SPAN></P>

The administrator claimed that &sect; 25 of the Good Samaritan Act (745 ILCS 49/25 (2002)) was unconstitutional and defeated the purpose of the Illinois Hospital Licensing Act (210 ILCS 85/1 et seq. (2002)). The administrator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had been undergoing a biopsy in the radiation department when she suffered cardiac arrest. She was transferred to the emergency room where the doctor responded to an &quot;any available cardiologist&quot; page over the intercom. Because the doctor rendered emergency care, and did not bill the decedent, appellees claimed that his actions were immunized from civil liability by the provisions of &sect; 25. The court found that there were no facts in dispute as to the doctor's good faith in providing emergency medical care. However, the doctor's answer to a supplemental good-faith interrogatory that he did not bill in cases like the decedent's conflicted with his billing service's testimony that, other than the decedent's case, there were no other cases where doctor had not billed patients for such services. The court found that the doctor's decision not to bill the decedent raised a question of material fact as to whether he acted in good faith and had an honest, lawful intent to provide medical services without fee, or whether the doctor was acting in bad faith and deviated from his routine billing practices to invoke the protection of &sect; 25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment and remanded the case for proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court adjudged defendant an habitual criminal and sentenced him to life in prison under the Habitual Criminal Act, 720 ILCS 5/33B-1 through 33B-3 (2006). On appeal, defendant argued that the sentence of natural-life under the Act violated his rights to due process and to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant exercised his U.S. Const. amend.

On appeal, defendant relied on Ngo, arguing that &sect; 33B-1(c)&nbsp;unconstitutionally increased his Class X felony sentence to one of mandatory life imprisonment based on facts that were, as in Shepard, too far removed from the fact of a prior conviction, i.e., that his two prior convictions did not result from and were not connected with the same transaction. The court distinguished Ngo on the facts: (1) defendant's first two armed-robbery convictions were not connected with the same transaction was clear from the record; (2) he was first convicted of armed robbery in 1990, and he was sentenced to nine years in prison; (3) his second conviction for armed robbery occurred in 1995; (4) his intervening stay as a guest of the government showed his convictions met the requirements of &sect; 33B-1; and (5) that the qualifying offenses were not part of the same transaction was inherent in the convictions themselves such that a determination by a jury of defendant's peers was not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for violating 625 ILCS 5/12-503(c) (2006) by having his view obstructed by a cherry air freshener hanging from his rear view mirror. The validity of the stop turned on the Fourth Amendment question of whether it was reasonable for the officer who stopped defendant to believe that he had observed defendant driving with a &quot;material obstruction&quot; of defendant's view. The trial court found defendant's testimony that the officer stated that defendant could not have anything hanging from his rear view mirror persuasive. Section 12-503 only prohibited items that materially obstructed a driver's view. The officer did not have a clear understanding of what a material obstruction was. Further, photographs taken of defendant's vehicle showed that the officer's belief that the air freshener was a material obstruction was not justifiable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In parentage and adoption cases combined for appeal, the trial court, inter alia, ordered appellee husband to submit to DNA testing, denied appellant father's petition for visitation, dismissed the father from the adoption, and found that the father had abandoned the child. All parties appealed, but the appeals were dismissed. The Supreme Court of Illinois reversed as to one appeal and remanded. The remaining dismissals were vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was dismissed from the adoption based on his failure to register with the Putative Father Registry. The appellate court found that this was error. The failure to register was irrelevant to the parentage action and did not affect the father's participation in the adoption. The order staying the adoption was appropriate until the parentage action concluded. The parentage and adoption proceedings were properly consolidated and should have remained so until the termination of all the litigation. Both actions concerned parentage and shared a common nucleus of parties and facts. Removal of the stay would have prejudiced the father's rights as the child's biological father. The trial court was authorized by Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 215 to compel the husband to submit to DNA testing. The husband placed his physical condition in issue by his declaration of parentage in the paternity action. The Parentage Act, 750 ILCS 45/1, did not authorize the trial court to deny the father's petition for parentage on the basis of best interest. The determination of parentage necessarily resulted in the determination of a parent-child relationship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was reinstated as a party to the adoption proceedings. The order compelling the husband to submit to DNA testing and the contempt finding against the husband were affirmed. The denial of the father's petition to establish a parent-child relationship was reversed and the case was remanded for a hearing on visitation. All rulings in the adoption subsequent to the trial court's denial of the father's request for a stay were vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an advocacy group and a city resident, sued defendants, a city and its officials, in the Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois) under 525 ILCS 30/17 (2004) and 520 ILCS 10/11(b) (2004) to require defendants to engage in environmental consultations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city said it did not &quot;authorize&quot; a gravel pit, as the term was used in 525 ILCS 30/17 (2004) and 520 ILCS 10/11(b) (2004), so the statutes' requirements to consult with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) did not apply. The appellate court held the city's acts met the definition of &quot;authorized&quot; because it was actively involved in initial planning stages, affecting its original plan for the land. It reviewed an owner's plans, negotiated an annexation agreement subjecting the owner to restrictions, and rezoned the land. The statutes' requirement that public agencies engage in environmental consultations was unambiguous, so private parties' prior consultations with IDNR did not meet the city's duties. It had to engage in the consultation because it &quot;authorized&quot; the project. It was no error to dismiss plaintiffs' request to declare ordinances the city passed as part of the process void. The statutes did not let a trial court, in a suit by private citizens, invalidate an ordinance, as plaintiffs could only seek mandamus relief, nor, was it error not to let them amend their complaint to ask that the city be ordered to pass ordinances voiding the ordinances at issue.</SPAN></P>

The claimants appealed the circuit court's award of $100,000, set off by the $50,000 the daughter had already received as the decedent's guardian.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants cared for the decedent for 9 1/2 years prior to her death. During that time, the decedent suffered from severe Alzheimer's and could not care for herself. The circuit court limited the claimants recovery to the last three years of the decedent's life. The claimants argued that the circuit court erred in applying a five-year statute of limitations to the custodial claim and in applying the set off. The appellate court agreed. Nothing in &sect; 18-1.1 limited the claimants' recovery to only five years prior to the date of a disabled person's death. Rather, the statute clearly set forth the requirement that the claimants have cared for the decedent for at least 3 years. Further, as &sect; 18-1.1 provided that the claimants were entitled to a claim against the estate when the decedent died, any statute of limitations that might apply begin to run until the date of death. In determining the amount of the claim, the circuit court should have considered the entire 9 1/2 years that the claimants cared for the decedent. The circuit court also erred in setting off the custodial award against the guardian fee as the custodial claim was to be in addition to any other reasonable claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonprofit corporation sued defendant county and developer, challenging a special use permit to construct a planned community development. The Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) dismissed the claims that sought review under the Administrative Review Law, 735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq., and alleged that the grant of the permit violated substantive due process (the LaSalle claim). The corporation appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court erred in dismissing the LaSalle claim on the ground that the corporation lacked standing under the associational standing doctrine where there was nothing inherently implausible about the corporation's arguments that only limited participation by its members would be necessary in the trial; establishing the corporation's right to relief on its claim did not necessarily require significant participation by the individual members of the corporation. 805 ILCS 105/103.10(b) did not impose more stringent requirements than that imposed by case law as the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute was to codify the common law. The fact that the corporation was not a party to the administrative proceeding did not prevent it from appealing the decision under 735 ILCS 5/3-101 as its standing was derivative of its members' standing. Since the members had participated in the initial hearing before the zoning board and the corporation met all of the other requirements of associational standing, the corporation was entitled to step into the shoes of its members in bringing the claim under the Administrative Review Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant citizen filed an interlocutory appeal in plaintiffs' action seeking review of a county board's denial of a conditional use permit application. The Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) certified: (1) Whether the denial of a special use was subject to de novo review as a legislative decision under 55 ILCS 5/5-12012.1 (2006), and (2) if not, did &sect; 5-12012.1 preclude review under the Administrative Review Law. 55 ILCS 5/1-6007 (2006)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that a denial of a special use permit by a county board was not subject to de novo judicial review as a legislative decision under &sect; 5-12012.1. Therefore, &sect; 5-12012.1 did not apply to the denial of plaintiffs' application for a conditional use permit. Although &sect; 5-12012.1 could be ambiguous, it plainly applied only to the adoption of a special use. Section 5-12012.1 was intended to reach not all county and municipal decisions on relevant zoning matters, but rather only decisions to grant the listed zoning actions. It applied only when a board adopted a special use, not when it denied one. To the extent &sect; 5-12012.1 was intended to remove the listed zoning decisions from the purview of the Administrative Review Law, it did not offend separation of powers principles, Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The legislature had the authority to remove certain administrative determinations from, or add certain determinations to, the ambit of judicial review. The type of review imposed by &sect; 5-12012.1 could be nominally &quot;de novo&quot; and could allow for the presentation of new evidence but was actually much less searching than the administrative review the statute curtails.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court answered the first certified question in the negative and did not reach the second certified question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a bench trial of residential burglary. Prior to her sentencing, the trial court ordered a Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC) evaluation. Despite being clinically acceptable for TASC, the trial court found that she was ineligible pursuant to the Alcoholism and Other Drug Abuse and Dependancy Act (Act), 20 ILCS 301/40-5(7) (2004), for TASC services because of the conviction and a prior felony conviction. She was then sentenced to four years in prison. She claimed on appeal that her sentence violated her equal protection and due process rights. The appellate court disagreed. It first noted that her argument had to be reviewed under the plain-error doctrine because she had not raised it in the trial court but claimed a substantial right was involved. It then found that plain error was not committed in finding she was not eligible for TASC, as the Act rationally distinguished between similarly-situated convicted felons based on deterring home invaders and was reasonably designed to remedy the evils the legislature determined to be a threat to the public safety, health, and well being, namely, people breaking into the homes of others.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-11(a)(2) (2004), criminal trespass and domestic battery. He sought a reduction of his conviction under Ill. Sup. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant did not arrive at the victim's house, at her invitation, for a significant time, she locked her door and did not answer her phone. He kicked her door down. The appellate court held he was not entitled to a reduction in the degree of his conviction, under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615, because there was no evidentiary weakness in the State's case, as (1) there was no fact question as to whether his presence in the victim's home was authorized, (2) the limited authority doctrine did not allow him to enter the home out of a concern for the victim's safety because he entered by force, and (3) sufficient evidence showed he physically injured the victim. The decision to believe the testimony of the victim and the officer over defendant showed no evidentiary weakness. Defendant did not show he received ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel did not tell him about a mandatory six-year home invasion sentence because the trial court told him of this sentence, and he said he understood. The trial court correctly concluded that defendant's ineffective assistance claim had no merit and refused to appoint independent counsel to pursue the claim at the trial level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the 21st Judicial Circuit, Iroquois County (Illinois), granted motions to dismiss filed by defendants, Secretary of State and vehicle sellers, in plaintiff buyer's suit that alleged violations of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 140/1 et seq. (2004), the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer sought title information from the Secretary for cars he purchased from the sellers through tax lien sales. The buyer's claim for declaratory judgment was premised on his alleged ownership of a security interest in a car when the sellers sought and the Secretary issued a new title for the car. He attached a note to the complaint, as required by 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-606 (2004), but the note showed that he did not obtain an interest in the car until years after defendants allegedly acted illegally by seeking and issuing a new title to the car. Thus, the trial court properly dismissed the declaratory judgment action. As to the FOIA claim for an immediate turnover of ownership records, the court found that the 10-day period of 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-123(f) (2004) directly regulated vehicle title searches, and that &sect; 2-123, not the FOIA, controlled the requests. The mandamus and quo warranto actions were properly dismissed because the buyer offered no proof that 92 Ill. Admin. Code &sect; 1002.20 was constitutionally invalid for not including sole proprietorships in its definition of a business entity for purposes consistent with the Illinois Vehicle Code.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-14.1(b)(1.2) (2002) and three concurrent five-year sentences for the latter conviction, to be served consecutively to the life sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant placed his penis into the mouth and buttocks of two six-year-old boys.

On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the mandatory life sentence provision in 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-14.1(b)(1.2) (2002) was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court deferred to the legislature's judgment and determined that sentencing defendant to the two concurrent life sentences for his two convictions was not cruel, degrading, or shocking to the moral sense of the community; therefore, it did not violate the proportional penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution. Further, the trial court did not err by imposing two concurrent life sentences for defendant's two convictions for predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. The plain and ordinary meaning of the statute authorized one life sentence for each conviction. However, the trial court erred by ordering the five-year sentences to be served consecutively to the life sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified defendant's three concurrent five-year sentences to be served concurrently with his two life sentences. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicted defendant of violating 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.1(a) (2004), granted his motion for a new trial, and vacated that order. He appealed, claiming that &sect; 5/24-1.1(a) unconstitutionally required the State to prove his felon status as an element of the offense, thus depriving him of procedural due process and violating the Equal Protection Clause of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant was not denied procedural due process when the trial court accepted a stipulation as to defendant's prior felony convictions for purposes of establishing an element of the offense because the name or nature of the prior conviction was not offered and a stipulation was the least prejudicial way to offer the evidence. A bifurcated trial under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 451(g) was not required because (1) the rule was not effective when defendant was convicted; (2) it only applied where an enhanced sentence was imposed under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/111-3(c-5) (2004); and (3) it did not apply where, as here, the legislature had made a prior felony conviction an element of the offense of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. The court found that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.1(a) did not violate the equal protection clause of the state or federal constitutions because (1) felons were not a suspect class; (2) all similarly situated felons were treated equally under the statute; and (3) the statute bore a rational relationship to the State's legitimate goal of deterring possession of firearms by felons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent patient appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which granted petitioner State of Illinois, through a psychiatrist at a state facility, authority to administer psychotropic medications to the patient pursuant to 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-107.1 (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition lacked the required 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-107.1(a-5)(1) (2006) allegation that the State had made a good faith attempt to determine whether a power of attorney for health care existed. The failure to include the allegation was not, in the instant case, harmless error. Further, &sect; 2-107.1(a-5)(4) had been interpreted to require trial courts to apply the substituted-judgment test before ruling on a petition under the best-interests of the patient test. A power of attorney for health care or a declaration for mental-health treatment was essential to the application of the substituted-judgment test as the test, through a surrogate, attempted to determine what the patient wishes would have been if she had been competent to make decisions. Both the record and the patient's brief indicated that a power of attorney for health care existed. Attempts should have been made to obtain that document before any ruling on the petition was made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Mississippi employer of respondent ex-husband, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which ordered the employer to pay $369,000 to appellee ex-wife as a penalty for knowingly failing to pay child support from the ex-husband's wages as required under the Income Withholding of Support Act, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 28/35(a) (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer did not begin withholding income until seven months after it received notice that it should withhold $3,000 per month from the ex-husband's salary. The appellate court affirmed. The notice was properly served under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 28/20(g) (2006). It informed the employer of its obligation to withhold the income and where to send the income. It also explained that if the amount ordered withheld exceeded the amount allowed by the law of its state, the employer should withhold only the amount allowed by law. The notice also advised the employer to contact the ex-wife's attorney if it had questions regarding the notice. Based on the clarity of the notice, the employer could not rebut the presumption that it knowingly failed to pay over the amounts it was obligated to pay. Contrary to the employer's assertion, under Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 93-25-67, -69 (2006) and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 666, the trial court properly determined that it had jurisdiction over the employer. Finally, the argument that the Withholding Act was unconstitutional because the penalty was totally disproportionate to the violation being punished had been previously rejected by the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he invoked the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine. The court declined to accept the invocation, finding that (1) the allegations as to the 1998 and 2004 rezonings were moot because the zoning ordinances were no longer in force; (2) the voluntary cessation doctrine did not apply because there was no showing that the city ceased enforcement until the coast was clear; (3) perpetuating the lawsuit so that the owner could attempt to elevate his personal zoning policy preferences over the city's citizens and their elected officials was not an appropriate use of the judicial system; (4) there was no longer an actual case or controversy between the parties once the city's council amended the municipal zoning ordinance; and (5) the owner had secured the substantive relief he sought, which was to negate the effects of the rezonings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition in the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) to rescind the Secretary of State's summary suspension of his driver's license based on an alleged refusal to submit to chemical testing of defendant's blood alcohol concentration. The trial court found defendant failed to make a prima facie case for rescission and granted the State's motion for a directed finding. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After medical personnel tested defendant's blood alcohol concentration (BAC), he refused an officer's request to submit to such testing. The appellate court held he raised a proper ground for seeking to rescind the suspension when he said statutes could be interpreted to state that, once medical personnel tested his blood, the arresting officer could not ask him for further tests. The matter was reviewed de novo because it involved statutory construction of whether testing under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501.4(a) (2006) barred the officer from seeking further testing under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501.1(a) (2006). The two statutes' plain language showed each applied to a distinct situation, as results of medical-personnel-directed testing were admissible only in driving under the influence (DUI) or reckless homicide cases and not license suspension proceedings, while results of law-enforcement-directed testing were admissible in such proceedings. Thus, it was not improper for the officer to ask defendant to submit to a test even though he knew hospital staff had already determined defendant's BAC, so it was proper to suspend his driver's license when he refused the request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Circuit of Schuyler County (Illinois) of predatory sexual assault of a child and aggravated sexual abuse, and was sentenced to nine consecutive life terms for the predatory sexual assault of a child and a 14-year extended-term sentence for the aggravated sexual abuse. An appeal on defendant's behalf was dismissed under the fugitive dismissal rule. A petition for rehearing was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the state's highest court had not directly addressed the constitutionality of 725 ILCS 5/115-10(a)(1) (2002) since the Crawford decision. Even if &sect; 115-10 was unconstitutional, the admission of child one's and child two's out-of-court statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Child one and the mother testified as to defendant's actions, relating the information they gave in statements to the sheriff and an employee. The employee and child one testified that defendant grabbed child one's breasts and buttocks, showered with her, and rubbed lotion on her breasts. A doctor concluded after a physical exam that child one had been sexually abused. A semen stain on child one's comforter matched defendant's deoxyribonucleic acid profile. While 730 ILCS 5/5-8-4(a)(ii) (2004) and 720 ILCS 5/12-14.1(a)(1), (b)(1.2)  (2004) appeared to provide for consecutive sentences, a defendant could only serve multiple life sentences concurrently, and the consecutive life sentences were modified. Finally, even if the fugitive-dismissal rule was a rule of forfeiture, it was appropriate to decide the case on its merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified to provide for concurrent life imprisonment terms for the predatory sexual assault convictions. As modified, the convictions were affirmed. The case was remanded for the issuance of an amended sentencing judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff buyers filed a personal injury action asserting strict product liability claims against defendant seller and manufacturer of a vehicle which they purchased. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted the seller's motion to dismiss. The buyers appealed. The issue was whether a nonmanufacturer only had to have actual knowledge of the defect for a strict liability claim under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-621(a) (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers bought a convertible from the seller. One of the buyers sustained permanent spinal cord injuries when the car rolled over while he was driving it. The buyers alleged that the design of the car proximately caused the injuries and that the car was in an unreasonably dangerous condition when it left the seller's control because the windshield and roof of the car improperly designed and the car was not equipped with sufficient devices to protect the buyer from traumatic injury in a reasonably foreseeable rollover. The buyers alleged the seller knew that the car was not equipped with a sufficient roll bar or other devices to protect the buyer but did not warn the buyers. The appellate court held that in a strict liability action, a &quot;defect&quot; was a product in an unreasonably dangerous condition. 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-621 required the buyers to show that a presumptively dismissed nonmanufacturer had actual knowledge of the unreasonably dangerous nature of the physical characteristics/design of the product, not just actual knowledge that the physical characteristics/design existed, in order to avoid dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the buyers reliance upon the &quot;actual knowledge of the defect&quot; exception to avoid dismissal against the nonmanufacturer had to allege that the nonmanufacturer had actual knowledge of the physical characteristics of the product that the buyers claimed were unreasonably dangerous and that said characteristics made the product unreasonably dangerous. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The dismissal of the complaint based on the deadlock did not violate petitioners' due process right to judicial review because 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-22 provided for judicial review to any party filing a complaint, whether or not the Board had taken any action. Nothing precluded judicial review in the event of a deadlock vote. Furthermore, the dismissal was not arbitrary and capricious. Nothing in the Code required the deadlock to be broken. The court could not review the dismissal on the merits, however, as there were no findings regarding whether justifiable grounds existed for the filing of the complaint. Remand was required for a statement of findings by the four members who had voted against the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant electrician was injured in an on-the-job circuit breaker explosion. His complaint included a count against his employer and a count against appellee utility. He challenged a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted summary judgment in favor of the utility finding that the action was barred by the construction statute of repose, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-214(b) (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electrician claimed that the statute did not apply because he had not alleged negligent design but negligent failure to perform ongoing maintenance duties on a building's 20-year old electrical system. Whether the utility could invoke the statute's protection to shield itself was in dispute among the state's appellate districts. The appellate court found that there was no question that the utility had a specific duty to maintain its equipment. The duty derived from its capacity as the power supplier and not from its status as installer of the system. The theory of recovery predicated on the utility's alleged failure to discover and repair defects in its power system setup was an activity that was not protected by the statute of repose, notwithstanding the utility's status as an installer of equipment. The court concurred with the holding of the Appellate Court of Illinois, Third District, in MBA Enterprises v. Northern Illinois Gas Company, in finding that the maintenance-related claims did not fall within the scope of the construction statute of repose as defined by the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed an appeal under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(a)(1) after the Circuit Court of Kane County, Illinois, entered an adverse ruling regarding the State's use of a surveillance videotape at defendant's burglary trial. Defendant then appealed an order that, as part of defendant's release under Rule 604(a)(3), required him to report to court services weekly until the State's appeal was resolved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the State's appeal. The appellate court granted the motion. The surveillance footage was obtained from the store defendant was alleged to have burglarized. Due to technical issues with the surveillance footage, the State wanted to use a second videotape created from the original material. However, the State was unable to create a second videotape that was an accurate reflection of the original surveillance tape. The trial court's order did not prohibit the State from presenting the surveillance footage to the jury. The trial court's order merely required the State to present the original surveillance tape to the jury. The order did not suppress the subject evidence, it merely impacted the manner in which the information was to be presented to the jury. As a result, a Rule 604(a)(1) appeal was not available to the State. As to defendant's appeal, assuming arguendo that the State's appeal provided the appellate court jurisdiction to consider defndant's appeal, it lost that jurisdiction when it dismissed the State's appeal. Further, the appellate court's decision rendered defendant's appeal moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court dismissed both the appeal filed by the State and the appeal filed by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dissolution of marriage action between petitioner wife and respondent husband, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Domestic Relations Division (Illinois), awarded the wife interim attorney fees pursuant to 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/501(c-1) (2004), and later found the husband in contempt for failure to pay that award. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband argued that the petition was barred by a provision of their premarital agreement that provided that the wife and the husband waived their rights to attorney fees. The appellate court found, however, that there was not a violation of the premarital agreement, as the interim fees that the trial court awarded constituted an advance against the marital estate. 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/501(c-1)(2) (2004) created a presumption that interim attorney fee awards were deemed advances from the marital estate. Contrary to the husband's argument, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/501(c-1) (2004) did not substantially impair any contractual obligation that the parties had regarding attorney fees, and did not violate the Contract Clauses of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, or the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. Documentary evidence attached to the wife's petition supported the conclusion that she lacked sufficient access to assets or income to pay attorney fees, and the award was reasonable. Because the husband represented that the issue was not to have been contemptuous, but to test the order's validity, it was proper to vacate the citation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contempt order was vacated. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, multiple vehicle drivers and others, sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which was entered in favor of plaintiff, a mother individually and on behalf of her disabled child and her deceased child, in her negligence action that arose from a multi-vehicle accident. Post-trial motions by some of the drivers were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to the multi-vehicle accident that left one member of the mother's family dead and the others severely injured, she filed suit against multiple parties, including her husband who was driving the family vehicle at the time. She entered into settlement agreements with various defendants, and thereafter, a large jury verdict was entered in her favor. The fault allocation was computed against the non-settling defendants (NSDs). On appeal, the court held that the denial of a truck driver's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was proper, as the evidence supported proximate cause. Inclusion of only the NSDs on the fault allocation form pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1117 (1994) was not error and did not violate due process or equal protection, as there was a rational basis for the classifications. There was no error in the trial court's evidentiary rulings, jury instructions, and denial of a driver's mistrial motion. The trial court erred in not granting the NSDs a full setoff for the judgment against one of the settling defendants under the Contribution Act. The trial court properly determined that the settlements were reached in good faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court with respect to the contribution judgments, which were vacated, and as to the failure to grant defendants a full setoff for the judgment against one of the settling defendants. The remainder of the trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Boone County (Illinois), which after a jury verdict found him guilty of committing the offenses of aggravated cruelty to an animal (510 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 70/3.02 (2004)) and possession of a firearm without a firearm owner's identification (FOID) card (430 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 65/2(a)(1) (2004)). The trial court imposed a sentence of 12 months' probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his conviction had to be reversed because the aggravated-cruelty-to-an-animal statute was unconstitutionally vague. The appeals court disagreed, as its review of the statute did not reveal inconsistent terminology or terms without definition or meaning that could not be discerned from their context. Defendant argued that the statute failed to define &quot;euthanasia,&quot; but it appeared that euthanasia would refer to the painless or humane killing of a companion animal. The appeals court believed that anyone who earnestly attempted to understand the statute could fully comprehend its terms and phrases and understand what was prohibited. A rational trier of fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was criminally culpable for  aggravated cruelty to an animal for shooting a family dog. Defendant admitted that he took the dog outside and away from home and shot the dog three times using a.45-caliber handgun, causing the dog's death. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that defendant knowingly possessed a firearm on October 10, 2004, without a FOID card, as the card submitted into evidence reflected that it had expired January 1, 2002.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), defendant was convicted of harassment of a witness (720 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that defendant, with the intent to harass or annoy a potential witness in a pending legal proceeding against him, communicated indirectly with the potential witness, in that he placed a 911 call and falsely reported that she committed or was committing traffic offenses. The call resulted in a police officer effecting a traffic stop in such a manner as to produce mental anguish and emotional distress. The appeals court found that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the potential witness suffered mental anguish or emotional distress as a result of defendant's false report. She testified that the incident was &quot;nerve wracking&quot; and defendant conceded that the potential witness was upset as a result of being pulled over by the police. The evidence was also sufficient to establish that defendant communicated with the potential witness. He indirectly communicated with her by calling the police and effecting the stop. The potential witness was aware of the indirect communication from defendant. She testified that, upon being stopped by an officer, she told the officer that she knew that defendant had made the 911 call.</SPAN></P>

No. 92 CR 6652(01). Honorable Evelyn B. Clay, Judge Presiding.<BR>People v. Harvey, 2008 Ill. App. LEXIS 328 (Ill. App. Ct. 1st Dist., Feb. 7, 2008)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted appellee State of Illinois' motion to dismiss the inmate's 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1401 (2004) petition for relief from judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his &sect;2-1401 petition, the inmate asserted that the dismissal of his prior postconviction petition was a void judgment because the trial court did not properly dispose of a contemporaneous motion for substitution of judge, in contravention of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/114-5(d) (1994). The appellate court affirmed. The inmate filed his substitution motion under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-8 (2004). Thus, the requirement in 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/114-5(d) that the motion be considered before any other action was taken did not apply. Further, while 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-8 provided that a judge other than the one who presided over a trial should consider a postconviction petition, that statute had been ruled unconstitutional a full 10 years prior to the inmate's motion. Even if the motion had been under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/114-5(d), the statute did not apply to postconviction proceedings. The inmate had no right to a substitution of counsel in such proceedings. Finally, the inmate failed to present any evidence of prejudice or arbitrariness by the trial court that would have required its recusal.</SPAN></P>

The petition was filed outside the two-year time period for filing stated in the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had been convicted on an amended information that charged, inter alia, four counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child (PCSA) under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-14.1(a)(1) (1996). The petition alleged that the information was defective because some of the conduct complained of was alleged to have occurred before the effective date of the statute. As a result, the inmate argued that the trial court had lacked jurisdiction to enter a judgment of conviction on the PCSA counts. The appellate court affirmed. A defective information or indictment did not deprive a trial court of jurisdiction. While the inmate was correct that the amended information was defective, the trial court still had jurisdiction to enter a judgment of conviction. Because the trial court had jurisdiction, the judgment rendered was voidable, and the inmate's 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1401 petition was subject to the limitations period under &sect; 2-1401(c). Thus, the inmate's failure to timely file his &sect; 2-1401 petition or prove any grounds to excuse his untimeliness barred his petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sua sponte dismissing his pro se petition pursuant to the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 ILCS 5/122-1 et seq. (2006), and 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 (2006), and assessed the inmate $ 105 in costs and fees. The inmate had been convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault and armed robbery, and sentenced to consecutive terms of 58 and 30 years respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that the trial court erred by recharacterizing his 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 (2006) petition as a post-conviction petition without admonishing him that it was doing so. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the inmate expressly invoked the Act in his petition and that the postconviction court clearly considered the inmate's petition under both the Act and &sect; 2-1401, denying leave to file a successive petition under the former and dismissing it sua sponte under the latter. The inmate also contends that the trial court erred in assessing costs and fees under 735 ILCS 5/22-105 (2006) for filing a frivolous petition when he was denied leave to file a successive post-conviction petition. The appellate court disagreed, finding that &sect; 22-105 applied to the inmate's petition, a &sect; 2-1401 filed against the State and commencing a new, collateral action attacking a judgment in the State's favor. Lastly, the appellate court found no merit in the inmate's contention that the costs and fees pursuant to &sect; 22-105 violated his constitutional right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) finding him guilty of domestic battery in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-3.2 (2004) and sentencing him to 12 months of conditional discharge, to mandatory domestic violence classes, and to fees and fines of $ 379.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court found that the relationship between the complainant and defendant qualified as a serious courtship in the context of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/112A-3(3) (2004), because they dated for six weeks and continued to have sexual intercourse up to and including the date of their altercation. Six weeks of dating coupled with sexual intercourse was not a casual acquaintanceship. Accordingly, defendant and the complainant were &quot;family members&quot; within the purview of the domestic violence statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-3.2(a)(1) (2004). The language in &sect; 12-3.2(a)(1) and the definition for &quot;family members&quot; in 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/112A-3(3) (2004) were explicit enough to serve as a guide for those who had to comply with and interpret the domestic violence statute, and defendant's vagueness challenge to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-3.2(a)(1) (2004) failed. Defendant failed to establish the deficiency prong of the Strickland test for ineffective assistance of counsel. In light of the fact that defendant personally spoke with a witness on the day of the altercation, he could have informed his attorney to conduct an investigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was entitled to a credit of $ 10 for two days he was incarcerated prior to sentencing. A $ 30 minor traffic ordinance violation fee imposed by the trial court pursuant to 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 105/27.2a (2004) of the Clerks of Courts Act was vacated. Defendant's conviction and sentences were affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow alleged that the decedent contracted lung cancer due to his exposure to chrome while working. The widow alleged that defendants conspired to spread false information that chrome posed no hazard to human health. The coalition disseminated information relating to chrome, but had no financial investment in any of the manufacturers and did not share in their profits. The appellate court determined that dismissal of the coalition was warranted because personal jurisdiction did not exist over the coalition. Personal jurisdiction was unavailable under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-209(a)(2) (2006) because it was not the coalition but a manufacturer or distributor that actually committed the tortious or injury-causing act in Illinois by selling chrome products without hazardous warnings. Personal jurisdiction was unavailable under &sect; 2-209(c) because (1) despite coconspirators' activities, there was a total absence of affiliating circumstances between the coalition and Illinois, (2) the widow did not allege any activity that the coalition purposefully directed at Illinois, and (3) there was no evidence that the coalition had any agreement with coconspirators regarding Illinois.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Despite the fact that the victim did not have an opportunity to view her assailants at the time of the crime, the appellate court concluded that her identification was sufficient as, inter alia, she had two opportunities to view them just before the robbery. Any inconsistencies in the victim's testimony was for the trier of fact to resolve. The appellate court also found it &quot;practically certain&quot; that throwing a brick at the windshield of an occupied car would result in great bodily harm to the driver, thereby supporting the battery conviction. Next, the appellate court found no error in the trial court's refusal to permit expert identification testimony, as the testimony would have been based on speculation given that there was no evidence on whether the victim was admonished at the lineup. The appellate court found that the admission of hearsay evidence as to the victim's identification of her cell phone was not reversible error, as the victim testified and was available for cross-examination. Finally, the appellate court concluded that defendant failed to show that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2004), providing for testing of DNA, was unconstitutional as applied to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Christian County (Illinois), which convicted him of four counts each of aggravated criminal sexual assault and criminal sexual assault, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-14(a)(2) and 12-13(a)(1) (2002). The trial court imposed a mandatory natural-life sentence on each conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from his sexual assault on his ex-wife. The trial court granted the State's motion to admit defendant's prior criminal record as substantive evidence pursuant to &sect; 115-7.3(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-7.3(b) (2004). After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of all charges and he was sentenced. On appeal, the court found that admission of the prior convictions was proper, as the State used it to show that the ex-wife understood defendant's threats and to show defendant's propensity to commit the acts. Section 115-7.3 did not violate the federal or Illinois due process or equal protection clauses. Defendant was not denied a fair trial under a plain error standard of review where no Boose hearing was held prior to the trial court requiring him to wear a &quot;leg device&quot; that prevented him from bending his knee enough to run. The device was hidden from the jury's view and no prejudice was shown. Defendant failed to show his counsel was ineffective on a number of issues, and he also failed to show errors in evidentiary rulings under the plain error standard pursuant to 134 Ill. 2d R. 615(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent juvenile appealed after the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) adjudicated him delinquent for committing aggravated criminal sexual abuse. At sentencing, respondent was told that when he turned 17 he would need to register under the Sex Offender Registration Act, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/1 et seq. (2006). He was also ordered to submit buccal swab saliva specimens pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent originally argued that requiring him to register as a sex offender under the Registration Act and the Sex Offender Community Notification Law, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 152/121 (2006), was unconstitutional. However, the parties agreed that the argument was rendered moot by 2007 Ill. Laws 658, which eliminated the provision in the Registration Act that required juveniles to register as adult sex offenders upon turning 17 years of age. Respondent's second argument was that the compulsory extraction of his saliva and perpetual storing of his DNA profile violated his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The appellate court rejected that argument based on the state supreme court's decision in Garvin and the appellate court's own prior rulings. 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 did not violate a juvenile's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, despite the argument that juveniles had a greater right to privacy than adult offenders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff village sued defendant former employee, alleging that the employee's severance constituted unjust enrichment and violated Ill. Const. art. 8, &sect; 1, the village's code of ethics, and 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-3-7 and 8-1-7(b) (2004). The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, granted summary judgment in favor of the employee. The village appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village alleged that prior to the date a newly elected village board of trustees was to take office, the outgoing village board voted to terminate the employee's employment as village manager so that he could claim a severance package totaling nine months of his salary. The appellate court determined that the outgoing board's renewal of the employee's employment did not provide the employee with any right to severance that he did not already enjoy. The severance did not constitute an unconstitutional gift of public funds in violation of Ill. Const. art. 8, &sect; 1, because the employee's past performance constituted adequate consideration for the severance and his severance pay had a public benefit. The village's code of ethics did not prohibit the village from offering severance pay as part of an employment contract. Regarding the village's argument that the employee's term could not exceed the term of the village president, there was no violation of 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/8-1-7(b), because the employee was terminable at will. The employee's term of employment satisfied the indefiniteness requirement of 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-3-7 because he was terminable at will.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff adult cabaret operator sued defendants, a county, a city, and a county official, alleging that defendants' amusement tax exemptions for small, fine arts venues that excluded adult entertainment cabarets violated the First Amendment and the free speech clause of the Illinois Constitution. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted defendants' motions to dismiss. The operator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants imposed on patrons of any amusement a tax on the admission price to enter, witness, view, or participate in any amusement within their boundaries. With the intent to foster the production of live performances that offered theatrical, musical, or cultural enrichment, defendants amended their amusement tax ordinances to include a small-venue exemption, but the exemption excluded performances conducted at adult entertainment cabarets. The appellate court determined that the adult entertainment cabaret exclusions from the amusement tax small-venue exemptions violated the First Amendment because they were content-based regulations on speech that did not serve a compelling state interest. The exclusions, on their face, discriminated based on content because they defined an adult entertainment cabaret by the content of the expression featured at the establishment. Defendants' interests did not rise to the level of a compelling state interest that would justify a content-based restriction on protected expression. The appellate court rejected defendants' contention that affirmative government policies encouraging selective private speech did not implicate the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to defendant's assignments of error, the appellate court held that: (1) the evidence was sufficient to find defendant guilty of domestic battery where the evidence showed, inter alia, that defendant and the victim had been in a relationship that was sexual and lasted about six weeks; (2) 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-3.2 (2004) was not unconstitutionally vague but rather, provided fair warning that grabbing a woman by the hair, throwing her against a car, and holding her up against a glass window was prohibited; (3) defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel because, inter alia, counsel was not informed of the potential witness defendant alleged would have corroborated his version of events and thus, had no duty to investigate that witness; (4) defendant was entitled to a $ 10 credit for the two days he was incarcerated prior to sentencing; and (5) the trial court erred when it imposed a fee, pursuant to 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 105/27.2a(w)(1)(E) (2004), because defendant was charged in a misdemeanor complaint but was not charged with a minor traffic or ordinance violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with unlawful delivery of alcoholic liquor to a person under the age of 21 (a minor) in violation of &sect;&nbsp;6-16(a)(iii) of the Illinois Liquor Control Act of 1934, 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-16(a)(iii) (2004). The Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois) granted defendant's motion to dismiss. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant were dismissed after the trial court agreed with defendant that 6-16(a)(iii) (2004) did not apply to minors who sold, gave, or delivered alcohol to other minors. On appeal, the State argued that the trial court erred in dismissing the charge against defendant because 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-16(a)(iii) (2004) did prohibit minors from distributing alcohol to other minors. The appellate court agreed with the State. The appellate court found that the references to people within certain age ranges in &sect; 6-16 demonstrated that the legislature, if it intended to do so, clearly had the ability and knowledge to limit the term &quot;person&quot; to those over the age of 21. The appellate court's interpretation of the statute was not inconsistent with the public policy of Illinois and did not defeat the purpose of the statute: to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public and to promote temperance in the consumption of alcohol, 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-2 (2004). Finally, the appellate court concluded that the fact that minors were treated differently in other statutes did not warrant the same determination in this instance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A chairman filed with the board 10 complaints against the named politicians. Each complaint alleged that the politicians violated the Election Code in specified ways. A hearing officer who presided over a closed preliminary hearing found all but one of the complaints were filed on justifiable grounds and recommended that those complaints proceed to public hearings. The board by a majority vote in two cases dismissed two complaints for lack of justifiable grounds. The board reached a tie vote on the remaining eight complaints and dismissed those complaints in compliance with 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-21 (2004). The board issued a final, written order in each case dismissing the complaint. The appellate court found that no clear error occurred in the majority vote cases because justifiable grounds did not support the chairman's filing of the complaints. Regarding the tie-vote cases, the appellate court found that the trial court properly dismissed those cases because the board did not give the 10 Ill. Comp. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, the 14th Judicial Circuit Court, Rock Island County (Illinois), convicted defendant of knowingly residing within 500 feet of a school building that persons under the age of 18 attended, a violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-9.3(b-5) (2006). It then sentenced him to probation, fined him $ 1,000, and imposed an additional $ 40 fine for the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in 1997 of a sex offense involving a child. The legislature enacted &sect; 11-9.3 in 1998, prohibiting the presence of sex offenders in school zones. The statute was amended in July 2000 to include &sect; 11-9.3(b-5). Defendant was released from prison in 1999. He was arrested on the instant charge in April 2005. The appellate court found that &sect; 11-9.3(b-5) was not an impermissible ex post facto law because it protected the public rather than punishing defendant. The appellate court also found that pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/110-14 (2006), defendant was entitled to a $ 5 per day credit on the eight days he had served. Finally, the fine imposed by the trial court for the victims' fund was improper because under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 240/10(c) (2006) that fine could only be imposed if no other fine had been imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction. The appellate court also vacated the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund fine and directed the trial court to grant defendant a $ 40 credit against defendant's $ 1,000 fine.</SPAN></P>

Appellee, the Illinois Department of Revenue, intervened. The court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. The organizations and the taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organizations and the taxpayers claimed that the alternative homestead exemption in the amendment to 35 Ill.

On appeal, the court found that (1) 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 200/15-176 did not unconstitutionally delegate to the counties the exclusive power of the Illinois General Assembly under Ill Const. art. IX, &sect; 6 to create an alternative homestead exemption; (2) the exemption contained in 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 200/15-176 did not create a constitutionally infirm nonuniform real property taxation under Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 4(a); (3) the amendment was not an ultra vires act by the General Assembly but the enactment of a constitutionally permissible homestead exemption under Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 6; (4) 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 200/15-176 did not violate the taxpayers' right to equal protection under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, nor their right under Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 to not be disadvantaged by special legislation; and (5) 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 200/15-176 was not improperly retroactively applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with committing aggravated criminal sexual assault by the use of force or threat of force while displaying a dangerous weapon, a handgun, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-14(a)(1) (2004). At trial, the victim testified that defendant sexually penetrated her while threatening her with a handgun. The jury found defendant guilty. The trial court did not rule on defendant's post-trial motion claim that he discussed with his attorney having a bench trial. It denied the motion and sentenced defendant. The appellate court found that upon remand, the trial court had to consider whether defendant should have a new attorney argue his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because it was not clear whether defendant's trial counsel neglected the bench trial request. It also found that defendant should not have been sentenced under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-14(a)(1), as that provision required that the crime be committed with something other than a firearm. Finally, it found that he lacked standing to claim that the statute he should have been sentenced under violated the Illinois Constitution because he was not sentenced under it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment of conviction was affirmed, the sentence imposed by the trial court was vacated, and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings as directed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the co-special administrators of the estate of a deceased child sued defendants, a sheriff, a gun manufacturer, and others, seeking to recover for the death of the child, who died after he was shot by a friend who was playing with the service weapon of his father, who was a deputy sheriff. The administrators appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted defendants' motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The friend found the deputy's service weapon in the deputy's bedroom closet. While playing, the friend accidentally shot the decedent. The administrators sued the sheriff based on a respondeat superior theory and sued the manufacturer based on a strict products liability theory. Reversing the grant of summary judgment to the sheriff, the court found that (1) the deputy stored his weapon at home in the course of his employment; (2) although the friend was adjudicated a delinquent in juvenile court for violating &sect; 24-9 of the Criminal Code, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-9, the juvenile adjudication was not tantamount to a criminal conviction, which would have absolved the sheriff of respondeat superior liability; and (3) the incident was reasonably foreseeable. With regard to the manufacturer, summary judgment was proper as to the defective design claim because, inter alia, the gun performed as expected and was not unreasonably dangerous for its intended use as a law enforcement service weapon. The manufacturer was not entitled to summary judgment on the failure to warn claim as there was no warning that a gun could fire a chambered bullet when the magazine was removed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to the sheriff on the issue of respondeat superior. The court also reversed the grant of summary judgment to the manufacturer with regard to the duty to warn claim. The court affirmed the remainder of the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

Ann. 5/116-3 (2004) and challenged the voluntariness of his guilty plea. The trial court denied his amended motion. On appeal, the appellate court found that he did not establish a chain of custody regarding the DNA evidence, and, thus, his request for DNA testing was properly denied under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/116-3(b)(2) (2004), he did not object to his plea agreement in open court and, therefore, could not show that his guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made, and he could not provide evidence to back his claim that the hearing on the amended motion was supposed to be limited to the constitutionality of 725 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) imposed a sentence of probation and $ 1,235 in fines, fees, and costs, including a $ 10 mental health court charge and a $ 5 youth diversion/peer court charge pursuant to 55 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-1101(e), (e)(2) (2006). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the youth diversion/peer court charges, and argued that the charges violated his due process rights. Defendant argued that because there was no rational relationship between a conviction for possession of a controlled substance and the public interests that induced the legislature to create the charge, it was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the youth diversion/peer court charge was not deemed to compensate the State for any costs incurred as a result of prosecuting defendant, and thus, these charges were fines notwithstanding the language of the statute. The charge was mandatory for any offender convicted of, inter alia, a felony. Clearly then the charge was not intended to reimburse the State for any of the costs of prosecution. As a fine, it was to have been upheld, under a due process analysis, unless the amount was wildly disproportionate to the underlying offense. There was certainly not such disproportionality under circumstances in which the fine was $ 5. The State conceded that the total of the fines, fees, and costs was overstated by $ 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court ordered that the total amount assessed against defendant be reduced by $ 20 to reflect the correct total of $ 1,215. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of two courts of first degree murder. The convictions were affirmed on direct appeal. The inmate filed a petition for relief from judgment which the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois) dismissed. The inmate then filed a petition for post conviction relief against appellee State, which the trial court also dismissed. The inmate appealed both rulings, and the appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's first-stage dismissal was on the ground that all the issues raised were barred by either res judicata or waiver. The appellate court found, however, that the petition presented the gist of a constitutional claim. Four claims of error in the petition did not include allegations of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, but because some of the claims were not subject to a dismissal at the first stage, the entire postconviction petition was required to be docketed for second-stage proceedings. Based on exhibits attached to the petition and citations to the record, the appellate court rejected the State's contention that the petition could have been properly dismissed on the basis of a failure to attach affidavits or other supporting evidence. Consideration of the State's arguments related to the merits of the petition was not needed because the arguments required the appellate court to go beyond a &quot;quick look&quot; at the record. These were the types of arguments that should have been argued to the trial court at the second stage of the procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent former husband sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois), which denied his petition under &sect; 2-701 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA), 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-701 (2004), wherein he sought a determination that petitioner former wife's response to his postdissolution petitions invoked a modification clause (MC) of the parties' marital settlement agreement (MSA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The MSA, which was incorporated into the parties' dissolution judgment, provided joint custody over their two children. The husband was required to use funds to establish an individual retirement account (IRA) in the wife's name for her use monthly as child support (CS). The MC of the MSA provided that if the wife sought to modify the custody, visitation, or CS, her right to withdraw same from the IRA would cease and those funds would transfer to an IRA in the husband's name. The husband thereafter filed postdissolution petitions, and in response, the wife sought a change in the children's day to day care. The husband sought relief under the DJA based on the MC. The trial court held that the wife's response to the postdissolution petitions was not itself a &quot;petition&quot; as defined by the MC of the parties' MSA. Accordingly, there was no transfer of the IRA funds required. On appeal, the court initially clarified the appropriate standard of review. It then held that the MC was not enforceable under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/502(f) (2004) because it violated public policy, in that it penalized the wife upon seeking a change that might have been in the children's best interests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a developer and homeowners, sued defendant tax collector in the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) for an injunction against the collector's refusal to allow property tax payment by specification and a declaration that this refusal violated 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 200/1-1 et seq. (2004), and U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. Plaintiffs sought to recover interest and penalty damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs said the tax collector had no policy on paying property taxes by specification. The appellate court held he had a policy because he did not allow it. His policy was not illegal because 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 200/20-210 (2004) said a collector &quot;may&quot; accept payment of property taxes by specification. His policy of refusing to accept payment by specification was not arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion because he had the discretion to accept or decline payment by specification as long as he did not violate the law. It was not alleged that he violated the law, and without such a claim, and proof thereof, a challenge to his exercise of discretion failed. Any purported fact question as to the viability of his reasons was irrelevant. Given such limits on judicial inquiry into executive discretion, the rational-basis test associated with substantive due process review of a legislative action did not apply, and plaintiffs' substantive due process argument failed because they claimed no fundamental right to pay taxes by specification. The equal protection argument failed because the collector treated all taxpayers similarly by not allowing payment by specification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dissolved the husband and wife's marriage.

He also filed a petition to establish specific visitation times. The trial court, ruling on the motion to vacate, refused to set a specific dollar amount. It did not make an Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 304(a) appealability finding. He filed a notice of appeal. The appellate court found that it had jurisdiction because Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 303(a) provided that a prematurely filed notice of appeal did not become effective until the judgment regarding the separate claim, the petition to establish specific visitation times, was entered. It also found that since that rule was procedural, it could be applied retroactively to allow for the husband's appeal. On the merits, the appellate court found that the husband had a right under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/505(a)(5) (2004) to have the support judgment state the dollar amount to be paid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) on plaintiff representatives' wrongful death claims against defendants, a sheriff and a gun manufacturer, granted the sheriff's summary judgment motion upon finding no duty existed to protect a shooting victim from a third party act and granted the gun manufacturer's summary judgment motion on its &quot;not unreasonably dangerous,&quot; no duty to warn, and intervening cause defenses. The representatives appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was a policeman. His son, who was 13-years-old, found the father's service weapon at home. The son pointed it at a friend and pulled the trigger. The gun fired, and a bullet in the gun's chamber struck the friend and fatally wounded him. The representatives sued, inter alia, the sheriff and the gun manufacturer. The claims against the sheriff were based on negligence under a respondeat superior theory that the sheriff was liable for the father's negligence in storing the gun so that nobody else could access it. The claims against the gun manufacturer were based on a products liability theory. The sheriff responded by stating that he did not have a duty to protect the shooting victim. The gun manufacturer primarily claimed that the son's conduct was an intervening cause of the death and that it was thus not liable. After the trial court ruled for the sheriff and gun manufacturer on summary judgment motions, the appellate court found that the sheriff could be liable for the father's negligence if that negligence occurred in the scope of the father's employment and that it was up to the jury to determine whether the son's conduct was criminal and foreseeable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Illinois Racing Board suspended and excluded appellant horse trainer from all racetracks under the supervision of the Board and revoked his licenses. The trainer filed an action against the Board and appellee officials and stewards in administrative review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-101 et seq. (2004). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) affirmed the ruling. The trainer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Investigators at a racetrack found that the trainer possessed and attempted to hide contraband consisting of needles, syringes, injectables, and prescription items. When the investigators confronted the trainer, he fled through a barn, ignored calls to stop, discarded items, told inconsistent stories, and attempted to cover up the issue. The Board found that the trainer violated Ill. Admin. Code tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 603.50, 603.80, and 603.90 (1998) and 230 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9(e) (2004) of the Illinois Horse Racing Act of 1975. On appeal, the court found that the trainer's contraband violations, combined with his behavior toward the investigators, supported the Board's finding that he violated &sect; 9(e) as his actions undermined public confidence and the reputation of horse racing. Moreover, the Board was authorized to determine a proper punishment and its actions in imposing an exclusion and suspension were not arbitrary, unreasonable, or contrary to its goal of protecting the honesty and integrity of horse racing. Finally, the trainer's due process rights were not violated as the Board provided sufficient notice of the charges against him and &sect; 9(e) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The health care providers claimed that no timely report of any reviewing health care professional was filed stating that there existed a meritorious cause of action, as was required by 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-622 (2004). Counsel for the estate representative sought to file such reports instanter. The reports were not signed, and did not reveal the reviewing health care professional's name and address, as was required by 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-622(a)(1) (2004). Counsel for the estate representative tried to hide the authority's identity and lack of qualifications. The trial court learned that the reviewing health care professional's report had been written by a person not licensed to practice medicine. On appeal, the appellate court found that no error occurred when the trial court ordered that the author of the report be disclosed and that the case was properly dismissed with prejudice for failing to comply with 735 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator law firm, acting on behalf of the State of Illinois, filed a complaint alleging that defendant retailers had violated the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 175/1 et seq. (2002) as to use tax. The Attorney General intervened. On an interlocutory appeal from the denial of defendants' joint motion to dismiss, the Illinois Supreme Court directed the present court to answer six certified questions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a remote retailer could not make a knowingly false record or statement to create liability under the Act if it disclosed that no use tax was due or collected based on its reasonable interpretation of the law. Next, the Act required the existence of an actual record or statement. Documents memorializing a purchase that disclosed that no use tax was being collected could not be considered false so as to create liability under the Act. Under the Act, a false record or statement did not have to be submitted to or directly relied upon by the State. Claims brought under the Act did not deprive defendants of rights and privileges so that the Act could not be used to enforce the collection of taxes, as litigants were afforded all the protections provided in civil proceedings. The Illinois Department of Revenue was not the sole entity authorized to assess and collect use tax when fraudulent records and statements were created. The Act applied to alleged tax liabilities under the Use Tax Act when fraudulent records and statements existed. Finally, the Act did not violate Ill. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 15 and 21, relating to the attorney general and to executive compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the six certified questions, and the cause was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a double homicide. After his and other offenders' death sentences were commuted by the Governor of Illinois, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, resentenced defendant to two concurrent natural life sentences. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the commutation order which removed his death sentence also removed the requirement of a mandatory natural life sentence under &sect; 5-8-1(a)(1)(c) of the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections. The appellate court disagreed. While the Governor had the authority to commute defendant's sentence to an undetermined term, he chose not to do so, but instead mitigated defendant's sentence to natural life imprisonment, the only other sentence available for a double homicide. The trial court had no discretion and was required by law to impose a life sentence without parole. As the trial court properly considered both statutory and nonstatutory mitigation evidence, defendant's rights under the Due Process Clause and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, were not violated. The trial court's characterization of the instant crimes and defendant's prior conviction as similar was not erroneous, and even if it were, such error was an insignificant element of defendant's sentence and was harmless in the context of defendant's fundamental right to liberty. Defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally disparate with that of his co-defendant, as defendant had a more serious criminal history.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant and the alleged tortfeasors were involved in a car accident. The claimant filed a negligence action. The case was assigned to mandatory arbitration. A discovery deadline was set. The claimant filed written discovery requests and notices to take the alleged tortfeasors' depositions. The alleged tortfeasors did not respond to the discovery requests, prompting the claimant to file a motion to compel. The trial court then had to order them to appear for depositions and to answer the claimant's interrogatories, all by a certain date. The trial court wrote that failure to comply with discovery would result in an order barring the alleged tortfeasors from testifying or presenting evidence at the arbitration and at trial. An arbitration hearing was held. The alleged tortfeasors admitted negligence. An award was entered for the claimant and against the one alleged tortfeasor who had been driving. The trial court granted the claimant's motion to bar rejection of the arbitration award, pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 91(b).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder. The intermediate appellate court reversed on grounds that his right to confrontation was violated by admission of the former testimony of the sole eyewitness to the crime. The Illinois Supreme Court vacated that judgment and ordered the intermediate appellate court to determine whether the testimony was admissible under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-10.4, and if not, whether the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a codefendant were arrested for murder; defendant fled and was a fugitive for 10 years. A witness testified at the codefendant's trial and named defendant as the shooter, but he died before defendant's trial. The codefendant had been acquitted and was unavailable to testify. The trial court admitted a transcript of the dead witness' testimony under &sect; 5/115-10.4; the instant court reversed on Confrontation Clause grounds. On remand, the instant court held that the witness' testimony was more probative as to the shooter's identity than any other evidence that could reasonably be procured. However, his testimony was untrustworthy because of (1) his felony convictions; (2) the lack of thorough cross-examination of his testimony, the only link between defendant and the crime; (3) his use of alcohol at the time of the crime; and (4) his possible hopes of making a deal on his pending robbery charge. As defendant's fleeing and failing to appear at trial was not aimed at intentionally procuring the witness's absence at a future trial, the doctrine of forfeiture of wrongdoing did not apply. As the error was very likely to have contributed to the conviction, it was not harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was reversed, his sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village negotiated two independent jurisdictional boundary line agreements, one with the united city and one with another village. The boundary line agreement with the united city was entered into first, making the older agreement; the boundary line agreement with the other village was entered into nearly 11 months thereafter, making it the newer agreement. The differences in the agreements caused some conflicts, which were discovered when the bank and another property owner attempted to develop a parcel that straddled the united city and the village. The united city and the bank sought a declaratory judgment action that creation of the later agreement invalidated the earlier agreement; it also sought relief for reformation or rescission earlier agreement. The trial court granted summary judgment to the village, dismissed the claims for reformation and rescission of the earlier agreement, and dismissed the bank from the action. On appeal, the appellate court found that statutory law that would invalidate the conflicting agreements applied prospectively only and that law was enacted after the agreements were entered into, and the dismissals were proper.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed. It found that defendant was arguing that the state constitution was violated because the same punishment was imposed for possessing a precursor and violation of another statute imposing punishment for possession of actual methamphetamine, which would be shocking to the moral sense of the community. The appellate court found that in making that argument, defendant was relying on a cross-comparison analysis that the state supreme court had abolished and, instead, should have been comparing whether the sentence was wholly disproportionate to the offense committed, which was the proper test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sought review of a decision of defendant board which denied unemployment insurance benefits to the employee. The Circuit Court of Effingham County (Illinois) affirmed the board's decision. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A claims adjudicator found the employee ineligible because she was receiving disqualifying income, in the form of a portion of her social security retirement benefits, that exceeded her potential unemployment benefit. A hearing referee affirmed this decision and the hearing referee was in turn affirmed by the board. Because the employee neither raised nor briefed the issue of constitutionality, the appellate court found that she waived that argument on appeal. The employee argued that the chargeable employer was not her base-period employer because the chargeable employer did not contribute to the retirement benefits she was receiving, which were based on employment with other employers before her earlier retirement from the work force and because her retirement benefits did not change when she began employment with chargeable employer. The &quot;base-period employer&quot; was the employer who paid wages to the claimant during the eligibility period. The chargeable employer was the employer who paid wages to the employee during the time period immediately before her unemployment claim. Thus, the board properly found that the chargeable employer was the base-period employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of unlawful use of recorded sounds or images, a violation of 720 Ill. Comp.

On appeal, he claimed the convictions were void because, inter alia, the federal Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C.S. &sect;101 et seq., preempted the state's regulation of his activities and the evidence insufficiently proved his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court found that the evidence insufficiently supported his convictions on count two, alleging unlawful use of recorded sounds or images in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/16-7(a)(2) (2004) and count four, alleging unlawful use or unidentified sound or audio visual recordings in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat.

Ann. 5/16-7(a)(2) (2004), had to be reversed since that statute was preempted by the federal Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C.S. &sect; 101 et seq.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of burglary. The trial court sentenced defendant to a term of imprisonment. When defendant filed a pro se postconviction petition from judgment, relating to his conviction for burglary, the trial court summarily dismissed the petition without an evidentiary hearing as frivolous and patently without merit. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing his postconviction petition because he adequately showed that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel by his counsel failing to obtain defendant's mental health records as the records could have given rise to a bona fide doubt of defendant's fitness to stand trial and could have served as mitigation at sentencing. He also claimed that he should not have been assessed a filing fee because it was not mandated by statute and because it violated his due process and equal protection rights. On appeal, the court found that defendant's claim of ineffective assistance was waived as the issue could have been raised previously on direct appeal, but defendant chose not to do so. In any event defendant failed to show ineffectiveness of trial counsel. Moreover, the trial court, pursuant to 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/21 (2004), 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/22-105(a) (2004), and 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 105/27.2a(g)(2) (2004), properly imposed a fee upon finding the petition was without merit. Finally, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/22-105 did not violate any constitutional due process or equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in connection with an incident in which police, who arrested him after learning during a vehicle stop that he had an outstanding arrest warrant, searched the car in which he had been riding and discovered a substance alleged to have contained cocaine. He requested that defense counsel not file motions to suppress statements he made to police since he did not want to cause delay to his speedy trial demand. As a result, defense counsel also did not file a motion to quash the arrest and to suppress evidence. Defendant was tried before a jury and was convicted. On appeal, the appellate court found that a statute which prohibited a police officer from inspecting a motor vehicle solely because of a seatbelt violation, 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-603.1(f) (2004), did not prohibit a police officer from making an expeditious warrant check and arresting defendant once it was learned that he had an outstanding arrest warrant. As a result, the appellate court found that had defense counsel filed a motion to quash the arrest and to suppress evidence, it would have been denied, which defendant did not have a viable ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the insured's complaint, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tax on the insurers' premium income was held unconstitutional. The insured said they breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by including the tax in his premiums. The appellate court held this claim failed because (1) the duty of good faith and fair dealing limited a party's discretion in performing contractual obligations and, when the insured paid a premium, the insurers had no discretion to decide whether to insure him, (2) any decisions the insurers made to include the tax in premiums was made before a duty of good faith and fair dealing arose under subsequent contracts with the insured, and (3) including the tax in premiums was not bad faith because the insurers could increase premiums to recover the tax. The insured did not show an insurer collected the tax after it was found unconstitutional. He had no standing to seek to a declaratory judgment because, if the insurers violated the unearned premium statute,&nbsp;215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/379.1 (2004), this did not give him a private right of action, nor was any violation redressed by refunding premiums, so he had no &quot;legal tangible interest,&quot; nor did he show the insurers' contracts violated public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of armed robbery under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-1 (2000) and 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-2(a)(2) (2000), and three counts of aggravated unlawful restraint under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/10-3.1 (2000). He was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 19 years for armed robbery and 10 years for each conviction of aggravated unlawful restraint. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While a husband, his wife, and their child were crossing a street, defendant walked up behind them and demanded the husband's money. The wife testified that (1) she saw that defendant had a gun; and (2) he said he would shoot them. Defendant fled after the husband gave his money to him. On appeal, the court found that the direct and circumstantial evidence was sufficient to show that defendant committed robbery with a gun. While defendant's conviction for aggravated unlawful restraint as to the husband violated the one-act, one-crime doctrine, his convictions for aggravated unlawful restraint as to the wife and child were proper because there were multiple victims of defendant's conduct. Moreover, under the totality of the circumstances, the child was restrained even though he ran back across the street when defendant approached his family. Finally, the trial judge had no authority under the case law at the time to apply enhancement provisions to defendant's sentence for armed robbery. The decision which overturned the case law was issued while the case was pending on direct review. Therefore, the proper remedy was to remand for resentencing as permitted at the time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The armed robbery and aggravated unlawful restraint of the wife and child convictions were affirmed, the aggravated unlawful restraint of the husband conviction was vacated, and the concurrent sentences for the aggravated unlawful restraint convictions were affirmed. The armed robbery sentence was vacated, and the matter was remanded to the trial court to impose a sentence within the range for armed robbery as it existed prior to its amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated criminal sexual abuse. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to consecutive 20- and five-year terms in the Illinois Department of Corrections. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was not deprived of a fair trial by the admission of 30 photographs of women's feet, the State's use of defendant's statements, or the use of a prior statement by defendant that was not disclosed in discovery. The photographs were relevant to defendant's identity and intent to sexually gratify himself. Defendant's statements were not used until the defense strategy was found to be based on the issue of identity. And, the late disclosed statement was not known to the prosecutor until the morning of trial and a continuance was offered to defense counsel, who refused it. Next, the appellate court concluded that trial counsel's strategic decision to challenge the prosecution's case by attacking the evidence as to great bodily harm, while unsuccessful, subjected the State's case to meaningful adversarial testing. Defendant's Batson claim failed because the record did not reflect purposeful racial discrimination and the two excluded venirepersons shared more than racial characteristics in that they both had a history of involvement with the legal process. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the 20-year sentence was not disproportionate to the nature of offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's armed robbery conviction and sentence of life imprisonment as an habitual offender was affirmed, he petitioned the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1 et seq. (2004). The trial court summarily dismissed the petition and denied his motion for reconsideration. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said his sentence was disproportionate because armed violence predicated on robbery with a category III weapon was identical to armed robbery but had a lesser sentence. The appellate court held his claim could not be considered because his post-conviction petition did not raise it. Res judicata barred the grounds on which he said his sentence was disproportionate because they were decided on direct appeal. The fundamental fairness exception to this rule did not apply because no decision since the affirmance of his conviction and sentence recognized the validity of his argument or said his direct appeal was wrongly decided, nor did the appellate court concede that its decision in his appeal was wrong. The life sentence was constitutionally proportionate when considered in the context of his violent offender history. The life sentence was not disproportionate under the identical elements test because it was based on three violent felony convictions and was not imposed solely for the armed robbery conviction. Once defendant was convicted of his third violent felony, the trial court had to find him an habitual criminal and give him a mandatory life sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The limited liability company filed a six-count complaint against the village challenging: (1) the village's refusal to rezone the limited liability company's property, which the village had annexed under an agreement with limited liability company's predecessor, and (2) a provision in the village's comprehensive plan recommending that the village acquire a right-of-way across limited liability company's property for a possible highway interchange. The village moved to dismiss the complaint as untimely. The village also argued that the counts of the complaint challenging the comprehensive plan were unripe. The trial court held that all of the counts were untimely, and it dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court correctly dismissed the counts of the complaint that challenged the annexation as time barred since such a challenge had to be filed no later than one year after the annexation becomes final, pursuant to 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-1-46 (2004), and was not. It also found that dismissal of the remaining counts was proper pursuant to the ripeness doctrine because the comprehensive plan recommendation did not have the force of law.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/32-4a(a) (2004) and sentenced him, as a Class X offender, to eight years' imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The day after defendant was arrested on a business owner's complaint of attempted misdemeanor theft, defendant yelled at the owner and another witness from about 25 feet away, calling the owner by name and threatening to kill both men. The appellate court affirmed. Section 32-4a(a) did not overbroadly sweep protected speech within its purview. Although communication was an element of the statute, that did not draw otherwise validly proscribed activities within First Amendment protection. The punishable behavior was narrowed by the elements of the statute, which required a specific intent to harass. Defendant's vagueness argument failed, in part due to the failure of the overbreadth argument. Additionally, defendant could not demonstrate that the statute failed to provide citizens with adequate notice or led to arbitrary enforcement. The punishable conduct was limited to a specific group of people and was further limited by the specific intent to harass so as to, inter alia, convey a threat. Finally, defendant's actions presented the exact type of conduct &sect;&nbsp;32-4a(a) was meant to proscribe, and the State's evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of his motion to suppress, defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a controlled substance (heroin) under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 570/402(c) (2004), and obstructing a peace officer under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/31-1(a) (2004).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another were stopped by police. An officer told defendant to raise his hands and interlace his fingers, which defendant did. While the officer was attempting to pat-down defendant, defendant broke free and ran. During the officer's chase of defendant, the officer lost sight of defendant for a few seconds. After defendant was apprehended, the officer found three bags of heroin in the area where he lost sight of defendant. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence recovered as the result of defendant's unconstitutional temporary seizure and pat-down search. The State argued that the temporary seizure and pat-down search were constitutionally valid; and, even if defendant's initial seizure was unconstitutional, defendant's actions of running from the police and abandoning the illegal drugs made them admissible. The appellate court concluded that the drugs were admissible as evidence even assuming arguendo the initial seizure of defendant was unlawful, because the seizure ended when defendant fled and the abandoned drugs were not obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for aggravated unlawful use of a weapon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction on the basis that his status as an overnight guest at a residence put him outside the scope of the aggravated-unlawful-use-of-a-weapon statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6(a)(1), (a)(3)(A) (2002). He contended that the statute permitted a person who was in his or her &quot;overnight living quarters&quot; to lawfully possess a weapon. The appeals court found he was not outside the scope of the statute. By his own admission, he was never anything more than a guest at the residence, and did not claim to live there. The sentence was not erroneous as a matter of law; to the contrary, it was within the statutory guidelines. Defendant failed to file a motion to reconsider his sentence and, therefore, forfeited his right to challenge his sentence under a theory of abuse of discretion. Both a Vehicle Code fee (55 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-1101(a) (2004)) and a court systems fine (730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-9-1.10 (2004)) were improperly assessed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Peoria County (Illinois) of two counts of felony murder (720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(a)(3) (2004)). He was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm. Pursuant to &sect; 5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) of the Unified Code of Corrections (730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) (2004)), he received a mandatory sentence of natural life in prison. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed &sect; 5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) was unconstitutional as applied to him. Specifically, he argued the sentence mandated by the Code violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970). The appeals court found that the natural life sentence imposed on defendant was neither cruel, degrading, nor so wholly disproportionate to the offense he committed as to shock the moral sense of the community. Therefore, we find that &sect; 5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) (730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) (2004)) was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Prior to killing a woman and her daughter he committed multiple burglaries. While released and on juvenile probation after the first burglary, defendant committed the offenses of theft and criminal trespass to a building. After his probation for those offenses terminated, he committed his second burglary. Again, while released on juvenile probation, defendant violated that probation by committing a criminal trespass to a residence. Following a period of confinement and home electronic monitoring, defendant was again found in violation of his probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with first degree murder and unlawful use of a weapon. Defendant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and unlawful use of a weapon, and was sentenced to 12 years for involuntary manslaughter and a concurrent 5 years for the weapon charge. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied defendant's motions to reconsider sentence and for a new trial, and his motion in arrest of judgment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's principal argument was that he was wrongly convicted of the uncharged offense of involuntary manslaughter of a household member because that offense was a separate and distinct offense from &quot;simple&quot; involuntary manslaughter, requiring proof of an &quot;element&quot; that the offense of first degree murder did not, that the victim was a household member. The appellate court disagreed, concluding that the victim's status as a household member was not an &quot;element&quot; of involuntary manslaughter. While 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3(f) (2000), required proof that the victim was a household member, that factor did not create a distinct offense, but rather enhanced the range of penalties for the offense. The appellate court further concluded that, inter alia, the charging instrument was not deficient, as it clearly identified the offense charged with sufficient specificity to allow defendant to prepare a defense and bar future prosecution arising out of the same conduct. Finally, the appellate court concluded that defendant's constitutional challenges to both 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3(f) (2000), and the compulsory extraction of his blood and storage of his DNA failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. The trial court found defendant to be Class X-eligible and sentenced him to six years' imprisonment. The trial court also assessed an Illinois Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund fine and a controlled substance assessment fine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer testified that he saw different people approach defendant. After each person handed money to defendant, defendant turned and signaled the accomplice. The accomplice then walked to a flower pot, picked up a brown vial, removed an object, and handed the object to the person who had approached defendant. Police officers recovered the brown vial, which contained plastic packets of cocaine. On appeal, the court found that (1) while the admission of the testimony of a witness regarding the accomplice's guilty plea violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because, even without the testimony, the police officer's testimony was more than sufficient to support the conviction; (2) the trial court did not err by failing to allow defense counsel to elicit the reason for the accomplice's guilty plea during the redirect examination of the witness; (3) the trial court improperly assessed an Illinois Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund fine under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 240/10(c)(2) (2004) as other fines were imposed; and (4) defendant was entitled to credits under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/110-14(a) (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed in part as to the conviction, the judgment was vacated in part as to the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund fine, and the judgment was modified in part as to the fees and costs order to reflect a credit towards defendant's drug assessment fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed an unknown person on a corner yelling the word &quot;rocks&quot; at passing cars and directing cars to an alley where defendant was standing. The officer observed defendant hand white items to car occupants who gave defendant money. Defendant ran from the police, threw a ziplock bag containing .1 gram of crack cocaine, and was found with $ 63 in his sock. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked the officer if he ever saw defendant speak with the unknown person on the corner. The officer said he saw the unknown person speak to defendant and accept money from defendant. Defense counsel continued questioning the officer about the interaction between defendant and the unknown person. The appellate court determined that there was sufficient evidence that defendant had an intent to deliver the drugs found in the ziplock bag. However, counsel was ineffective because counsel elicited damaging testimony not presented as part of the State's case. The evidence prejudiced defendant because (1) the testimony connected him to the man on the corner, (2) it explained why no money was found in his pockets, and (3) the trial court clearly relied on the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trustee appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) dismissing with prejudice under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2--615 (2004) her first amended verified complaint, which challenged the facial validity of amendments to defendant city's zoning code that changed the permitted uses of a trust property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After thorough study, the city amended its zoning code to increase tax revenues in certain business districts. The trustee alleged that amendments precluded the ground floor of the trust property from ever being sold or leased to a financial institution and raised a facial challenge to the amended code's validity, which the trial court dismissed for failure to state a cognizable claim. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly applied rational basis scrutiny, rather than intermediate scrutiny, in granting the dismissal. The proper level of scrutiny was determined, not by whether the trustee's challenge was facial or as-applied, but by the nature of the right at issue. Rational basis scrutiny was properly applied to challenges to legislative enactments to which extreme deference was owed, including zoning enactments such as the zoning code at issue that did not involve fundamental rights. The court refused to apply the substantial relationship test, i.e., the forerunner of the intermediate scrutiny standard, to the trustee's facial challenge. The city's amending the zoning code in order to promote its fiscal policy was a rationally based decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff special administratrix of a decedent's estate appealed after the Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois) dismissed with prejudice a medical malpractice action against defendants, a children's aid society, a hospital, and two doctors, based on plaintiff's failure to comply with the 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-622(a)(1) (2004) and denied plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. A previous complaint had been voluntarily dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff had requested a 90-day extension of time to file her &sect; 2-622 doctor's report when the case was refiled. At issue was whether a prohibition in the &quot;civil reform&quot; version of &sect;&nbsp;2-622 against such extensions of time where a case had previously been voluntarily dismissed applied to bar plaintiff's case. The appellate court, reexamining its Cargill decision, reversed. The language had been ruled unconstitutional in Best in 1997. However, the language remained in the statute when the legislature amended another portion of the statute in 1998. In Cargill, the court ruled that the amendment &quot;resurrected&quot; the unconstitutional language. Post-Cargill, however, the legislature again amended the statute. According to prefatory language in 2005 Ill. Laws 4964, the offending language disappeared with Best and was never reenacted. The legislature specifically rejected the civil-reform version of 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-622 as a source for its 2005 amendments and instead &quot;continued&quot; the pre-1995 version of the statute. Thus, plaintiff's previous voluntary dismissal of the malpractice action had no bearing on her request for an extension of time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

At sentencing, the trial court sentenced him to natural life imprisonment pursuant to Habitual Criminal Act, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33B-1 (2000). He appealed, and his conviction and sentence were affirmed. Defendant then filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court summarily dismissed his petition as frivolous and patently without merit. On appeal, defendant primarily argued that his sentence for armed robbery was unconstitutional because it violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The appellate court found that his petition suffered from a number of procedural defects, but added that his biggest problem was that he was not sentenced for the armed robbery conviction, which he compared to another statute to make his argument, but, instead, was sentenced under the habitual offender statute.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) affirmed the Department and denied the licensee's subsequent motion for reconsideration. The licensee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department filed an administrative complaint, alleging that the licensee engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with a female patient. The Director of the Department, after a telephone conversation with a Department investigator, summarily suspended the licensee's license. After an evidentiary hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found that the licensee violated 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 15(7) (2004), and made recommendations. An administrative board recommended a suspension and probation. The Director adopted the recommendation. On appeal, the court found that (1) the Director did not abuse his discretion under 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 15/15.4 (2004) by denying a rehearing; (2) the ALJ did not make improper evidentiary and credibility determinations; (3) 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 15/21.6 (2002) was not unconstitutionally vague; (4) the summary suspension did not violate the licensee's due process rights; and (5) although the Illinois Clinical Psychologist Licensing Act, 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 15/1 et seq., itself, was not unconstitutional, the Department violated the licensee's right to due process by not promptly reaching a final determination after the hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the witness harassment statute was unconstitutionally overbroad because it criminalized constitutionally protected speech. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the elements of the statute containing speech were not constitutionally protected because the punishable speech was limited to situations where the specific intent element was satisfied, the communication was directed at a juror because of his or her verdict or a witness because of his or her testimony, and must ensure either mental anguish of emotional distress to convey a treat. Defendant also argued that the statute was vague on its face. The appellate court disagreed, noting the scope of punishable conduct was limited to a specified group, jurors or witnesses, and was further limited by the individual's specified intent to harass or annoy when communicating so as to inflict mental anguish or emotional distress or to convey a threat. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the State proved defendant guilty of witness harassment beyond a reasonable doubt, as the evidence showed defendant approached the victims with the intent to harass them and threaten their lives.</SPAN></P>

Summary judgment was entered against the other defendant for negligence. The case was then tried to the jury on the strict products liability claim. The jury found the other defendant 60 percent liable and the car manufacturers 40 percent liable for the death of the decedent. The jury then awarded $ 2 million for loss of money, goods, and services and $ 25 million for loss of society. On appeal, the car manufacturers raised a number of issues, and primarily claimed that the jury had been improperly instructed and that the damages were excessive. The appellate court found that the jury could be instructed on the consumer expectations test and that the loss of society damage award was excessive.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed, holding that 1) based on the lack of a record provided by defendant, it was presumed that the trial court acted properly in ordering a new trial after the case was remanded for the proper admonishment of defendant; 2) conducting a trial after the remand did not violate double jeopardy concepts because defendant's conviction was not set aside due to the insufficiency of evidence; 3) defendant's convictions under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-204.1(a)(2) and (3) were not inconsistent with his acquittal under &sect; 11-204.1(a)(1) because a violation of the latter subsection was not a predicate for violation of the other two subsections; and 4) the trial court did not exceed its authority under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to six years in the Illinois state penitentiary and ordered defendant to pay a total $ 3,704 in fines and fees. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his conviction should have been reduced to simple possession of a controlled substance because the State did not prove he had the requisite intent to deliver. The appellate court concluded that, when viewed as a whole in the light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to deliver the narcotics in his possession. Among other things, defendant possessed 23.9 grams of cocaine and admitted to an officer that he sold drugs to take are of his family. In response to defendant's numerous sentencing issues, the appellate court concluded, inter alia, that defendant was entitled to credit, under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-7(b) (2004), for time spent in full custody prior to trial and between his guilty finding and his sentencing, and for actual time spent at the jail as a participant in the day reporting center program. Defendant was also entitled to credit against the controlled substance assessment for the same time periods, pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/110-14 (2004). Finally, the appellate court upheld the order for DNA extraction and storage as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed. The order that defendant pay $ 5 to the Spinal Cord Injury Paralysis Cure Research Trust Fund was affirmed. The mittimus was amended to reflect 204 days' credit and to reflect a credit of $ 1,020 to be applied against the $ 3,000 controlled substance assessment. The order to pay a Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund penalty was reversed. The order regarding the extraction and storing of DNA was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Later, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus alleging that the indictment in his new case was faulty. The trial court denied the petition; that denial was affirmed on appeal. Thereafter, he filed a motion for free transcripts in which he asserted that he would be seeking to withdraw guilty pleas in his old case, where the guilty pleas had been entered 15 years before. The trial court then denied that motion. On appeal, the appellate court found that res judicata barred defendant's DNA testing request, no prejudice resulted from the summary dismissal of his habeas corpus petition, and defendant's request for free transcripts was not timely filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed a complaint against defendant county treasurer in which they sought a return of duplicate real estate tax payments they had made over five years before the complaint was filed. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the action as time-barred under 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 200/20-175 (2004). Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that their duplicate payments were not &quot;tax payments&quot; but mistaken payments of real estate tax assessments that had already been satisfied. First, plaintiffs had provided no authority for their proposition; thus, this argument was waived under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 341(h)(7). Second, the duplicate payments, even if made by mistake, amounted to &quot;overpayments.&quot; A tax was overpaid when a taxpayer paid more than what was owed, for any reason. Thus, the payments were not tangible personal property, and the Illinois Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act, 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 1025/0.05 et seq. (2004) did not apply. Next, a request for a return of overpaid taxes was properly characterized as a claim for a refund. The language and the legislative history of 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 200/20-175 indicated that it applied to refund claims for duplicate payments such as those made here. Finally, because plaintiffs' tax bills had been paid when they tendered the duplicate payments, they had a right to a refund of those payments on the date that they were made, and the limitations period began at that time. Thus, the claims were time-barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of Coles County (Illinois) convicted defendant of two counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that defendant had forfeited his argument that the trial court erred in granting the State's motion to take the victim's testimony via closed-circuit television under 725 ILCS 5/106B-5(a)(2) (2004). At trial, defendant had objected to the testimony only on the ground of confrontation, not for failure to meet the statutory requirements. Furthermore, this situation was similar to another case in which the court had concluded that the trial court's ruling was adequate in context, although the trial court had not invoked the precise statutory language. Next, the victim was present for cross-examination and answered questions asked of her by defense counsel. Thus, she was not unavailable as a witness, and any prior statement of hers being offered at trial under 725 ILCS 5/115-10 (2004) was a nonevent for purposes of the Confrontation Clause of U.S. Const. amend. VI. Finally, although the trial court did not give the pattern jury instruction with regard to &sect; 115-10 at the end of the trial, it did give that instruction orally after each of three witnesses testified about the victim's hearsay statements. Thus, there was no plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial judge convicted defendant of possession of a controlled substance. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to 30 months' imprisonment, imposed a $ 500 drug assessment, ordered defendant to pay a $ 5 fee for deposit in the Spinal Cord Injury Paralysis Cure Research Trust, and ordered extraction of defenant's blood and perpetual storage of his DNA. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the $ 500 drug assessment was really a fine and should not have been imposed without a finding of defendant's ability to pay it as required by 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-9-1(d) (2002), and that he was entitled to a credit of $ 185 against the assessment for the 37 days spend in presentence incarceration. The appellate court agreed that the assessment was a fine, declining the State's invitation to reject the consistent line of appellate decision that allowed a sentence credit against the drug assessment. In addition, the appellate court found nothing in the Senate debates that indicated an intent that the drug assessment be anything other than a species of fine. Defendant also argued that his due process rights were violated by the imposition of a fee for deposit in the Spinal Cord Injury Paralysis Cure Research Trust, because it was an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of police power. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the fee could properly be viewed as a criminal penalty. Finally, the appellate court held that the DNA extraction did not violate defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The costs and fees order was amended to reflect a credit of $ 185 against the $ 500 &quot;Assessment Controlled Substance.&quot; The $ 5 fee for the Spinal Cord Trust was affirmed. The trial court's order that blood be extracted from defendant for storage of his DNA was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city charged the corporate officer and valet parking company with multiple violations of the city's municipal code. Eventually, the city filed 11 administrative cases against them. The Department of Administrative Hearings (DOAH) initially found them liable for multiple violations arising out of the operation of a valet parking service in the city. The DOAH then imposed various fines. The trial court affirmed as to liability, but remanded to the DOAH for a new hearing on fines. Following a new hearing, the DOAH imposed new fines. The trial court affirmed. The corporate officer and valet parking company appealed, and alleged that the administrative record did not comply with applicable statutory law, that the DOAH erred in finding that the fines imposed were the individual responsibility of the corporate officer, and that the fines imposed by the DOAH were excessive and unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the administrative record fully complied with the statute, that the corporate officer participated in the fraud that was the subject of many of the fines, and virtually no analysis was offered about why the fines were excessive and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 6 (1970) by denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence recovered from a dryer vent because defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy to the dryer vent. The State proved defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of possession of a controlled substance because it was highly unlikely that anyone tampered with the contents of the dryer vent between the time officers broke surveillance and the time the officers recovered the narcotics from the vent. Defendant was precluded from arguing insufficiency of the chain of custody because defendant stipulated that a proper chain of custody was maintained at all times, depriving the State of the opportunity to correct any deficiencies at the trial level. A $ 5 Spinal Cord Injury Paralysis Cure Research Trust Fund fine was proper, but a $ 20 Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund fine was improper because defendant was already properly fined $ 500 under the controlled substance assessment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff hotel association filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant, the Director of the Illinois Department of Labor, in which plaintiff sought to have 3.1 of the One Day Rest in Seven Act, 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 140/3.1 (Supp. 2005), declared unconstitutional. Defendant union intervened. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 3.1 required employers to provide hotel room attendants with breaks, a meal period, and a break room. It applied only to hotels in Cook County. The court held that &sect; 3.1 was not special legislation under Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 because it applied to Cook County. The legislature could have rationally concluded that the statute would protect hotel room attendants from overwork in the jurisdiction where the majority of such employees would be affected and in the one best positioned to absorb the costs of the new regulations. For the same reasons, the statute did not violate equal protection. Next, the statute was not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq. It did not regulate conduct governed by 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 157 or 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 158; rather, it set forth a minimum labor standard for individual attendants, whether they were unionized or nonunionized. Such standards were not preempted by the NLRA. 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 140/3.1 neither encouraged nor discouraged the collective bargaining processes. Furthermore, &sect; 3.1 did not proscribe or support strikes, lockouts, use of replacement workers, or any other economic weapon of self-help.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicted her following a jury trial of the first-degree murder of her infant son and sentencing her to 50 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court rejected defendant's argument that the prosecution's comments during rebuttal denied defendant a fair trial. When viewed in context of defense counsel's argument that the police had a &quot;theory,&quot; the medical examiner was in on it, and the police &quot;fed&quot; defendant the statements she made, the prosecutor's response was proper. Moreover, any error would be harmless based on the strength of the evidence demonstrating defendant's guilt. The sentence was an appropriate exercise of discretion, and the 50-year term was not excessive, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(a) (2000). The trial court was informed of defendant's youth, her difficult background, her lack of a criminal history, and her potential for rehabilitation. She murdered her own defenseless, infant son. She did this, as reflected in a videotaped statement, because she wanted to attend a party with her boyfriend and felt the baby was holding her back. She was not prejudiced by any error relating to jury instructions regarding eligibility for an extended-term sentence. The record reflected that no enhanced sentence was imposed and no comment by the judge suggested an enhanced sentence was considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The clerk of the circuit court was ordered to correct the mittimus to reflect credit for 943 days defendant spent in custody prior to sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The State of Illinois, acting through those two state agencies, appealed and asserted that: (1) the community spouses did not exhaust administrative remedies, (2) the community spouses forfeited their claims by failing to raise them before the administrative agency, and (3) the court erred in finding the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396r-5, preempted the spousal-support provisions of 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/10-1 et seq. (2004). The appellate court found that the community spouses were not required to exhaust administrative remedies since the issue in the case, interpretation of a federal statute, was one purely of law and did not fall within an administrative agency's particular expertise. It also found that their claims, being constitutional, were outside an administrative agency's purview, and that the federal statute did not indicate an intent to preempt the state law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also did not err by not appointing new counsel to investigate defendant's posttrial pro se motion of ineffective assistance, because defendant was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to secure the testimony of a coworker. The testimony would simply have established that defendant was in the same area where an officer testified he saw him selling narcotics. Nor did counsel's inability to locate the coworker fall below objective standards of reasonableness in discharging his duties to defendant. Counsel's efforts were indicative of due diligence in discharging his duties to defendant and not indicative of an abandonment of the case. The trial court did err by imposing a $ 20 fine for the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund because the court properly imposed a controlled substance assessment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner approached the state transportation agency and requested that it purchase a parcel of property from him because the parcel was located directly in the right-of-way for a proposed federal interstate highway. Its representatives allegedly made certain promises to him. Eventually, he conveyed the parcel to the state transportation agency in return for a specified payment. However, he did not leave the property. The state transportation agency had to file forcible entry and detainer actions. He later vacated the parcel. He filed a complaint for administrative review to challenge the condemnation of the property. The trial court dismissed the complaint as having been untimely filed and as being barred by res judicata. The appellate court found that res judicata barred each of the claims that the property owner had raised. It so concluded because it found that over the many years that the condemnation action was litigated, there had been a final judgment on the merits of the claims that were rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, that there had been an identity of the cause of action, and an identity of the parties or their privies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted on two counts of possession of an altered card pursuant to the Illinois Credit Card and Debit Card Act, 720 Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a worship center, appealed an order of Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) denying its petition for attorney fees from a city pursuant to the Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 775 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed a complaint alleging that the worship center was violating a zoning ordinance by holding services in a zone which did not allow a church as either a permitted or conditional use. The city ultimately amended the ordinance to provide that a church could be a conditional use in. 775 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 35/20 (2004) stated that a party who prevailed in an action to enforce the Act against a government was entitled to recover its attorney fees and costs. The appellate court held that an agreed order entered by the trial court in which the city agreed to allow the center to occupy the property while the city considered whether to amend the ordinance was temporary and, ultimately, pyrrhic. Rather than an alteration of the legal relationship of the parties, the order appeared to be an agreement to preserve the status quo. The center's argument that it prevailed because the city voluntarily amended its ordinance also failed. The order provided only that the city would consider amending the ordinance, and the actual amendment was purely voluntary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois) of attempted first degree murder and home invasion. The trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent prison sentences. The trial court dismissed defendant's first petition under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 through 122-8 (2000). The trial court later dismissed an amended petition under the Act by defendant. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant conceded that his amended petition constituted his second postconviction petition and that it was untimely because it was filed well outside the time periods specified in 725 Ill.

Nonetheless, he contended that this procedural hurdle did not justify the trial court's dismissal of his amended petition because he purported that he was advancing a claim of actual innocence and that his delay in filing the petition was not due to his culpable negligence. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly dismissed defendant's amended petition because defendant failed to comply with 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1(f) (2004) of the Act, which required that defendant obtain leave of court before filing a successive petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied his motion for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/116-3 (2004). He contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion because the identity at issue requirement was unconstitutional as applied to him; he also argued that his due process rights were violated because the trial court ruled on issues beyond the scope of the hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to robberies and rapes. He requested the testing, challenging the voluntariness of his guilty plea. Preliminarily, the state appellate court declined to consider his constitutionality argument because defendant failed to meet the chain of custody requirement of &sect; 116-3(b)(2); he failed to allege with specificity if the proper authorities took DNA, when the DNA was received, or mention anything pertaining to its current condition. Nevertheless, the appellate court then addressed, and rejected, defendant's constitutionality arguments on both due process and equal protection grounds. Because &sect; 116-3(b)(1) implicated neither a suspect classification nor a fundamental right, the appellate court applied the rational basis test, finding that the legislature could have included that subsection to restrict the availability of DNA testing to those who maintained their actual innocence. Further, while the appellate court was not prepared to hold that a guilty plea categorically divested a defendant of the opportunity to request DNA testing, it held that defendant could not satisfy the identity at issue requirement due to his guilty plea, which, it held, was voluntary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for DNA testing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and attempted armed robbery. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to 60 years' imprisonment for murder, a concurrent term of 20 years for armed robbery, and a consecutive term of 8 years for attempted armed robbery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sole contention on appeal was that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied defendant's request for a separate jury verdict form for felony murder. Defendant argued that if the jury had returned a verdict of guilty for the count of felony murder based on the attempted armed robbery of the victim, defendant would not have received a consecutive eight-year sentence because the offense underlying the felony murder charge would not have supported a separate conviction and sentence. The appellate court held that when a defendant who is charged with intentional or knowing murder and felony murder requests a separate verdict form for felony murder and such a request has a basis in the evidence presented at trial, the separate verdict form must be given or consecutive sentences cannot be imposed based on the offense underlying the felony murder, pursuant to section 5-8-4(a) of the Unified Code of Corrections, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-4(a) (2004). Because a separate form was not given, eight years might have been added to defendant's sentence and thus, the appellate court concluded, modification was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was modified so that the attempted armed robbery sentence was to run concurrently with the other sentences. The judgment of the trial court was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was entitled to a new trial on both charges because in each case defendant was tried in absentia without counsel.

As for the second charge, the appellate court noted that the legislature intended no exception based on a prior waiver of counsel. Therefore, conducting a trial of defendant in absentia without counsel present was reversible error regardless of whether there was a valid waiver of counsel. The appellate court further noted that there was nothing to prevent a trial court from issuing a warrant for defendant's arrest for failure to appear for trial and then, upon defendant's arrest, conducting a trial. If defendant could not be found, the court could appoint counsel, provide a reasonable time for counsel to prepare and then conduct the trial in absentia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 12th Judicial Circuit Court, Will County (Illinois), entered a judgment that affirmed a decision of appellee state education board granting a petition to detach certain property from appellant one school district and annex it to appellee second school district pursuant to 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-2b (1998). In so doing, it made an independent finding titled &quot;Constitutional Issues.&quot; The one school district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owners petitioned pursuant to 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-2b (1998) to detach property from the one school district and annex it to the second school district. The state education board could only address whether the detachment requirements under that statutory section had been met. The hearing officer found the property owners met those requirements. In so concluding, he found that the second school district's argument that the statute violated federal law to be outside the scope of the state education board's statutory and regulatory authority. The state superintendent then granted the petition. The trial court affirmed and made an independent finding that the state education board's actions did not create a constitutional impediment or violate federal law. On further review, the appellate court found that the state education board had jurisdiction to grant the petition, the state education board did not err in finding that the statutory requirements had been met, the trial court lacked both the jurisdiction and evidence to make the independent finding, and the statute was facially unconstitutional since it conflicted with federal law on the same subject.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated that portion of the trial court's judgment titled &quot;Constitutional Issues,&quot; affirmed the findings of the state education board on those issues that it considered, and remanded the matter to the state education board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following bench trial, defendant was convicted of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced him to 18 years in the Illinois Department of Correction and assessed a $ 20 penalty for the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund, a $ 5 fee for deposit into the Spinal Cord Injury Paralysis Cure Research Trust Fund, and a $ 2,000 controlled substance assessment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court failed to properly inquire into his pro se claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the trial court reviewed defendant's motion and specifically gave him the opportunity to argue, explain, and support his allegations. In addition, the record did not reflect ineffective assistance of counsel but, rather, inter alia, trial strategy in the context of a choice not to litigate a motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence. Defendant also argued that the trial court's use of a presentence investigation (PSI) report to determine the existence of a prior conviction was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed, holding that such use of the PSI did not violate defendant's constitutional rights and that the PSI was an acceptable source for the trial judge to use when considering defendant's prior criminal background. Finally, as to the fines imposed, the appellate court concluded, inter alia, that defendant was entitled to credit against the controlled substance assessment for his 453 days of incarceration prior to his conviction and that the violent crimes assessment was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, as was the charge for the Spinal Cord Fund. The $ 20 for the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund. The fees and costs order was modified to reflect a credit of $ 2,265 toward the $ 2,000 drug assessment, thereby negating the drug assessment in its entirety. The mittimus and sentencing was ordered modified to reflect a conviction for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, to wit: heroin.</SPAN></P>

The general contractor claimed that the claimant was its immediate employee and that he was barred from suing the general contractor because of the exclusivity remedy provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, 820 Ill.

A jury trial was held and after the trial court denied the general contractor owner and general contractor's motion for a directed verdict, the jury found them negligent and awarded damages to the claimant and spouse. The trial court then denied their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of driving while his license was revoked (DWLR) under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-303(a), (d) (2004), unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.1(a) (2004), and armed violence under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33A-2(a) (2004).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his conviction for armed violence should be vacated because a conviction for enhanced DWLR could not serve as a predicate felony for armed violence and if enhanced DWLR could be used as a predicate felony, it had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court held that DWLR could be a predicate offense for armed violence because such use deterred individuals from carrying a weapon while committing the felony of driving while their license was revoked. The appellate court further found that the evidence demonstrated that defendant carried a weapon while driving a vehicle illegally and that when the officer attempted to stop him, defendant purposefully evaded the officer and attempted to hide in a nearby house. Defendant also claimed that his sentence should be vacated because it was unconstitutional, an abuse of the court's discretion and violated one-act, one-crime principles. The appellate court disagreed, concluding that the sentence did not contravene the proportionate penalties clause simply because the predicate felony offense fell into the lowest felony classification, nor was the sentence excessive in light of the nature of the offense.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 130/1 et seq. The landscape contractors association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landscape contractor's association petitioned the state labor department to create a new job classification for landscape workers pursuant to the Prevailing Wage Act, 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 130/1 et seq. (2004); at the time, the landscape workers were included in the laborer classification. After a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) dismissed the landscape contractor's association's petition upon concluding that the landscape workers were properly classified as laborers because the landscape workers performed work that was similar to work performed by laborers. On appeal, the trial court affirmed the ALJ's decision. On further review, the appellate court found that the ALJ's decision to uphold the state labor department's laborer classification was not clearly erroneous. It so concluded because the evidence in the record showed that the landscape workers did not possess different skills, knowledge, or abilities from those of laborers, while no evidence showed that landscape workers had to undergo specialized training. As a result, the appellate court found that the ALJ's conclusion was supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant cargo trailer manufacturer challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois) in favor of plaintiffs, a truck driver and his wife, for injuries the driver sustained when a chain broke while he was attempting to tie down an automobile to a cargo trailer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court found the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying motions to exclude an expert's testimony on grounds of late and/or inadequate disclosure (Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 213). The manufacturer never sought an order to compel a more detailed disclosure, waiting instead until after the original trial setting had been continued, due to its own last-minute discovery of the chain, to seek to exclude the expert's testimony. The trial court also did not err in dismissing the manufacturer's third-party complaint on the ground that it did not file its complaint until after the statute of limitations for contribution claims, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-204(b) (2002), had expired. Although the manufacturer did not learn the specific identity of potential third-party defendants from plaintiffs' complaint, the complaint gave it notice that it might have a contribution claim against the manufacturer or distributor of the chain. The trial court applied the wrong standard in denying plaintiffs' request to submit punitive-damages claim to the jury, relying on a statute found to be unconstitutional. However, they were not automatically entitled to a new trial on the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings, with directions for the court to make the determination required of it by 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-604.1 (2002). If the court concluded that there was a reasonable likelihood that plaintiffs would recover punitive damages, they would be entitled to a new trial limited to that issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee beneficial owners filed an action against appellant city in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), for a declaratory judgment that they were the owners of a strip of property, and that the city had no interest in the property. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment to the beneficial owners. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject property ran adjacent to lots owned by the beneficial owners. The city argued that the beneficial owners' action was time-barred, and that the subject property was dedicated to and accepted by the city for the benefit of the public. On appeal, the court found that the Illinois Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act's one-year statute of limitations under 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 10/8-101 (2002) did not bar the beneficial owners' action because, pursuant to 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 10/2-101 (2002), the beneficial owners did not seek damages. Additionally, although the subject property was designated as a named avenue, there were no marks or notations on the plat evidencing an intent to dedicate the property for use by the public. Accordingly, there was no statutory dedication under 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 205/3 (2002). Finally, because the city addressed only the statutory dedication of the subject property in the lower court, any argument concerning a common-law dedication was waived. Moreover, because there was no evidence of clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous donative intent, there was no common-law dedication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver. The Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) sentenced him to 10 years' imprisonment under the agreement. Later, the trial court denied defendant's motion to correct sentence and then sent a letter informing defendant's warden that the pleadings were frivolous and patently without merit under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3(d) (2003). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by finding that his &quot;motion to correct sentence,&quot; in which he challenged his mandatory supervised release term, was a &quot;lawsuit&quot; as defined by 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3(d) (2003). The appellate court found that, although defendant titled his pleading as a &quot;motion to correct sentence,&quot; the trial court treated the motion as a petition under the Postconviction Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1 through 122-8 (2004), which was included in the definition of &quot;lawsuit&quot; in 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3(d) (2003). Because of defendant's direct appeal, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain defendant's issue in a freestanding motion. Thus, defendant had to raise his claim in a statutory collateral proceeding. Defendant failed to set forth any statutory authority for the motion. Accordingly, the &quot;motion to correct sentence&quot; was not a cognizable action under Illinois law, and thus the Shellstrom procedures did not apply. Defendant did not suggest any other statutory collateral cause of action in which he could have raised his mandatory-supervised-release issue and not have been subjected to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3(d) (2003).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of unlawful restraint under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/10-3(a) (2004), and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. Because defendant was convicted of unlawful restraint of a minor, the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) required defendant to register as a sex offender pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/2(B)(1.5), 3(a) (2004). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the State failed to prove him guilty of unlawful restraint beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the State presented sufficient evidence through the victim's testimony to establish defendant's commission of the offense; among other things, the victim testified that defendant grabbed her, took her through a door, &quot;jumped&quot; her up, and grabbed her pants and pulled them down to her ankles. The State's failure to call the victim's family members did not give rise to an inference that their testimony would have harmed the State's case, as the defense could called them to testify the family members, who were equally available to the defense, to impeach the victim but chose not to. Defendant also contended that the Act was unconstitutional as applied to him, because his crime did not involve any sexual motivation or sexual component. The appellate court disagreed, concluding that the Act was rationally related to the protection of children and that it rationally applied to those convicted of unlawful restraint of children because those defendants might have a greater propensity to harm a child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court determined that the circuit court's dismissal of defendant's 735 Ill. Comp. Stat.

Stat. Ann. 5/1-100 et seq. (2002), and (2) defendant had previously and unsuccessfully raised the same issues on direct appeal. The circuit court erred in determining that defendant's 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1401 petition was untimely, but this error was harmless in light of the finding that the petition was without merit. Also, the circuit court did not recharacterize the &sect; 2-1401 petition as one brought under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Act), 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 et seq. (2002). The pro se postconviction petition was properly denied under the Act because (1) there were no affidavits or other supporting documentation attached to the petition, (2) each allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel had been raised twice previously, and (3) his allegation regarding the denial of a motion to suppress could have been raised on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved for reconsideration of an order in which the Circuit Court of Greene County (Illinois) denied his motion to rescind the summary suspension of his driver's license and his motion to suppress evidence and quash his arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-501(a)(2) (2004). The court granted the motion for reconsideration. The State of Illinois appealed. Defendant moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arresting police officer followed defendant to the home of defendant's girlfriend and entered the home to question defendant after observing defendants' erratic driving, defendant's failure to stop at the officer's directives, and the officer's smelling alcohol on defendant's breath. The officer served upon defendant a notice of the summary suspension of his driver's license for refusing to submit to a chemical test. On appeal, the court found that, because the State nol-prossed the DUI case after the granting of the motion for reconsideration, the portion of the appeal pertaining to the suppression of evidence and the quashing of the arrest (an interlocutory ruling that vanished with the criminal case) was to be dismissed. As for the rescission of the summary suspension, that ruling occurred in a civil proceeding separate and distinct from the DUI case; therefore, the nolle prosequi had no effect on that ruling, which was appealable as a final judgment. Moreover, the trial court's rescission of the summary suspension of defendant's driver license was improper because, pursuant to the doctrine of hot pursuit, there was no violation of defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was dismissed in part insomuch as it pertained to the suppression of evidence and quashing of the arrest. The trial court's rescission of the summary suspension of defendant's driver's license was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of sexual exploitation of a child. Additionally, the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County, Illinois, ordered defendant to pay a fee for the collection of his DNA. The issues on appeal were (1) whether the State proved that he possessed the requisite mens rea for sexual exploitation of a child, and (2) whether the trial court possessed the authority to impose a DNA collection fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims testified that defendant exposed himself to them, masturbated in front of them, and touched one child inappropriately. The appeals court found that even considering the other child's testimony that nothing came out of defendant's penis, it was not &quot;inherently implausible&quot; that a rational trier of fact, confronted with this evidence, could have found that there was sufficient proof that defendant's sexual gratification was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant also argued that the trial court exceeded its statutory authority in ordering him to pay a fee for the collection of his DNA. The fee was not a cost authorized by statute. Thus, under the order, the fee was an unconstitutional infringement on the legislative power rather than a valid exercise of judicial power. Further, the chief judge's general administrative authority under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. Rule 21(b) could not appropriately encompass or purport to exercise a power so closely akin to the revenue raising power of the legislature. Therefore, the administrative order granting the trial judge specific authority to impose the $ 10 collection fee exceeded the powers granted to the chief judge under Rule 21(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of two counts of sexual exploitation of a child was affirmed. The DNA collection fee was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with unlawful delivery of a controlled substance for delivering 1 gram or more but less than 15 grams of heroin (720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 570/401(c)(1) (2002)). Defendant pleaded not guilty but was convicted after a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois). The trial court sentenced defendant to a 12-year prison term. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed he was denied his right to a fair trial by the State's misstatement of the law, which allowed the jury to convict him without finding that the State had proved his intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The appeals court found that the prosecutor's use of the word &quot;unwittingly,&quot; while perhaps misleading out of context, was not a misstatement of the law. Defendant argued that he was entitled to an additional day of credit for time served and an additional $ 5 credit toward his fines because the day of sentencing should be included in calculating the number of days he spent in custody. Defendant was remanded to the Department of Corrections (DOC) on the day of sentencing. Prior case law indicated that a defendant should not be given credit for the day he was remanded to the DOC. A $ 5 spinal-cord-injury fee was a fine and was unconstitutional. The State conceded, and the appeals court agreed, that the trial court had no statutory authority to impose a local anticrime fee when a defendant was sentenced to prison. The imposition of other fines was a judicial function beyond the authority of the clerk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed, except the fines imposed by the clerk were vacated, and the case was remanded for proper imposition of the fines by the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a final judgment of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty on one count of reckless homicide.

He was extremely intoxicated and drove it in the wrong direction. His vehicle collided with a motorcycle driven by the victim, killing the victim. Defendant was found guilty of reckless homicide and was sentenced to 14 years in prison. On appeal, he asserted that his sentence exceeded the maximum sentence permitted, that the crime was inadvertently referred to as &quot;aggravated reckless homicide,&quot; that the State failed to produce photographs and measurements of the accident scene, that the State impermissibly allowed the jury to see certain photographic evidence, and that the 14-year sentence was excessive. The appellate court found his sentence was proper, as even though a new reckless homicide law had been enacted one year after his offense and one year before sentencing, the law made substantive changes to the offense, no plain error occurred regarding the inadvertent reference to &quot;aggravated reckless homicide,&quot; the failure to produce the inadvertently-lost photos and measurements did not prejudice defendant, the photographic evidence was properly admitted, and the sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the taxpayer and an electronic publisher were not unitary, the sale of the publisher by the taxpayer represented a liquidation in the business of electronic publishing, and the gain therefrom was apportionable business income. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a manufacturer of paper and packaging products, filed a combined unitary Illinois income tax return, which included the electronic publisher as a member of the taxpayer's unitary business group, and included in its Illinois combined apportionable business income the income earned by the publisher, but excluded the gain from the sale of the publisher. On appeal, the court found that the taxpayer did not establish that the finding of an operational purpose was against the manifest weight of the evidence, nor did it establish as clearly erroneous the conclusion that the gain was non-business income. Additionally, as the taxpayer reinvested the sale proceeds in its ongoing business, the gain satisfied the functional test and was properly identified as business income under 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1501(a)(1) (2002). Moreover, the taxpayer did not prove clearly and cogently that the apportionment of the gain was grossly disproportionate to its Illinois income or activities under 35 Ill.

It was definite enough to give a person of ordinary intelligence in defendant's position fair warning of his duties. 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-401 (2002) gave sufficiently definite standards for law enforcement and triers of fact so that its application did not depend on their private conceptions. Defendant showed no real or substantial risk of self-incrimination had he complied with statutory requirements to report the accident. He did not show an inference of causation would be reached from admitting involvement. Any inference resulting from his compliance would not have been testimonial or communicative and thus protected under the Fifth Amendment. His claim that danger of self-incrimination was heightened because the requisite information had to be reported in one hour was speculative.</SPAN></P>

After a stipulated bench trial, defendant was found guilty of unlawful possession of 100 grams or more but less than 400 grams of cocaine, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress. Specifically, defendant claimed that the traffic stop was not justified because the officer believed that all suspended objects violated 625 Ill. Comp. Stat.

Defendant further argued that even if the officer had testified that the beads materially obstructed defendant's view, that belief was unreasonable. The appellate court concluded that the officer acted under a mistake of law when the officer stopped defendant because something was suspended between defendant and the front windshield. The appellate court further concluded that a reasonable officer, correctly interpreting the law and considering the facts available at the time, would not have had reasonable suspicion to initiate the traffic stop. The officer did not testify that the quarter inch beads that were hanging from the mirror &quot;materially obstructed&quot; defendant's view, but only that they hindered defendant's view.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city filed a suit against defendant worship center in 2003, alleging violations of the city's zoning ordinance, Elgin, Ill., Mun. Code tit. 19. The center appealed after the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) dismissed its counterclaims, which challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance and asserted that it violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its counterclaim, the center contended that the zoning ordinance violated the U.S. Const. amend. XIV Equal Protection Clause and violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc(b)(1), (2), (3)(B), of the RLUIPA. The city dismissed its complaint after the counterclaim was filed, amended its zoning ordinance, and then moved to dismiss the counterclaim pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-619, on the ground that the amendments cured any defects in the ordinance. On appeal, the center did not dispute the amendments' curative effect. It argued that the former zoning ordinance was void ab initio and that it had acquired a vested right under the &quot;common law&quot; of zoning to use the property without obtaining a conditional use permit, as required by Elgin, Ill., Ordinance No. G65-05 (2005), which amended the ordinance. The court held that the appeal was not moot because it could grant relief to the center. The circuit court correctly rejected the center's claim that it acquired a vested right to continue operating. The void ab initio doctrine did not apply because the ordinance was not void on its face. Having failed to comply with it, the center did acquire vested rights arising from the former ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother filed a complaint against defendant employer seeking child support payments that the employer allegedly withheld from the father but failed to timely remit. After striking the employer's affirmative defense of laches, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered judgment against the employer for $1,172,100 in statutory penalties pursuant to 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 28/35 (2004). The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found no error in the trial court's decision to strike the employer's affirmative defense of laches because the facts alleged by the employer di dnot support his contention that he was prejudiced in any way; the penalty imposed was not caused by the mother's delay in filing suit, but rather by the employer's knowing failure to remit child support withholdings in a timely manner. As for the employer's contention that 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 28/35 (2004) was unconstitutional as applied to the employer because the penalty imposed deprived the employer of his property without due process, the appellate court concluded that &sect;&nbsp;35 was unconstitutional as applied in this case because the $ 1,172,100 penalty imposed against the employer was approximately 47 times greater than the maximum criminal fine the legislature has found necessary to ensure a spouse's compliance with a child support obligation. The gross disparity between the penalty applied in this case and the maximum criminal fine demonstrated that the $ 1,172,100 penalty was wholly disproportionate to the employer's offense and obviously unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was reversed and the case was remanded with directions to the circuit court that it hold a hearing to determine the appropriate penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee community spouses sued the State of Illinois in the Circuit Court for Sangamon County (Illinois), for declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the State was illegally attempting to collect support from them for the support of their institutionalized spouses who were in long-term-care facilities and receiving Medicaid. The court enjoined the State from seeking support from the income of the community spouses. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of the complainants was a &quot;community spouse&quot; of an &quot;institutionalized spouse&quot; as those terms were defined in 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396r-5(h) (2000) of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396r-5 (2000). The State, under authority found in Ill. Admin. Code tit. 89, &sect; 103.10, sought spousal support from the community spouses' income for the amount that their income exceeded the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance established by the MCCA in 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396r-5(d)(3) (2000). The community spouses argued that the State did not have the authority to do this pursuant to the MCCA. On appeal, the court found that Congress neither explicitly or impliedly preempted Illinois law, and Illinois law did not frustrate the execution of federal law. Therefore, the Illinois law regarding family responsibility was not preempted by the MCCA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of two counts of attempt (first degree murder), under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/8-4, 9-1(a)(1) (2002) and home invasion under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-11(a)(5) (2002). The Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to two concurrent 60-year terms in prison for attempt and 85 years in prison for home invasion, and ordered the sentences be served consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In upholding defendant's conviction, the appellate court concluded that there was no error in the admission of other-crimes evidence, as, inter alia, it was admissible under various exceptions including the continuing-narrative exception, the common scheme or design exception, the motive exception, and the intent exception. In addition, even if the trial court had decided not to admit such evidence during the State's case in chief, it would have been admissible to rebut defendant's alibi defense. Defendant's ineffective assistance claim also failed, as defendant failed to show that counsel's decision not to request a limiting instruction for the other-crimes evidence was not a tactical decision. Defendant also argued that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to kill the female victim. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the jury reasonably could have inferred intent from defendant's use of a deadly weapon and the character of the attack. Defendant's conviction for attempt as to the male victim and home invasion did not violate the one-act, one-crime rule as they were based on interrelated acts, not exactly the same physical act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erroneously admitted cannabis discovered in his bedroom and car because it was not relevant to the question of whether he was inebriated at the time of the accident, which occurred when defendant was driving a tractor-trailer. The appellate court agreed but found the error harmless because the evidence was cumulative of properly admitted evidence of cannabis discovered in the tractor-trailer. Next, the appellate court found that defendant's conviction for reckless homicide was amply supported by the staggering amount of THC that remained in defendant's system eight hours after the incident and defendant's decision to put other motorists in danger by driving the tractor-trailer at least 45 miles per hour into a busy intersection that displayed at best, a yellow light, and at worst, a red light. Finally, as to defendant's sentence, the appellate court concluded that defendant was prejudiced when the trial court did not admonish him of the opportunity to elect sentencing under the new, more favorable version of the reckless homicide statute because the State could not have charged defendant under the new aggravated DUI statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guilty findings of former reckless homicide and former aggravated DUI were affirmed. The sentence for former reckless homicide was vacated, and the cause was remanded for sentencing on the former aggravated DUI charge. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that voluntary visits between the paternal grandmother and the child began shortly after the birth of the child. There was no indication of any problems during this period, and the mother, who never married the father of the child, sought to let a natural relationship develop. According to the maternal grandmother, things were fine until the father sought to establish his paternity. The mother then terminated the paternal grandmother's visitation. When the father was granted supervised visitation with the child, the paternal grandmother was allowed by the mother to attend with the father, but was prohibited from visiting without the father. When the father stopped visiting the child, the mother denied the paternal grandmother further visitation with the child. On appeal, the court found that the trial court's determination that the denial of visitation was unreasonable was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Further, there was no error in the trial court's finding that the mother's denial of visitation was harmful to the child's mental, physical, or emotional health. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting visitation.</SPAN></P>

She alleged negligence against defendant, the driver of a car that struck the car in which the decedent was riding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died when his car was hit from behind by the other driver's car. Summary judgment was entered against the other driver, and the case proceeded to a jury trial on the strict products liability claim. The jury found the other driver 60 percent responsible for causing the decedent's death and the motor companies 40 percent responsible. The jury awarded the widow $ 2 million for loss of money, goods and services and $ 25 million for loss of society. On appeal, the court held that the jury was properly instructed on consumer expectations law as it related to strict products liability. Further, the trial court did not err in denying the companies' suggested instructions regarding the risk-utility test when it allowed testimony about the risks and benefits of the vehicle's seat, which had collapsed on impact. Illinois courts allowed evidence of the risks and benefits of an allegedly defective product as evidence that it did not conform with consumer expectations. However, the court held that remittitur of the award for loss of society was appropriate under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 366(a)(5) because the award was arbitrary and excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the award for loss of society and remanded that portion of the judgment for a determination of the appropriate amount of remittitur. The court affirmed the remainder of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother, individually and on behalf of her minor son, filed a products liability action against defendant, a designer-manufacturer of lawn tractors that had its principal place of business and corporate headquarters in Illinois. Pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 308, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) certified a question for interlocutory appeal on a choice-of-law issue. The designer appealed on the certified question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother alleged that her son was injured when his father backed over him with the lawn tractor. The family resided in Michigan, and the lawn tractor was purchased there. However, the design decision not to incorporate a &quot;no-mow-in reverse&quot; safety feature into the lawn tractor was made by the designer in Illinois. The question was whether Illinois or Michigan law applied to the case. Applying the &quot;most significant relationship&quot; test, the court ruled that Illinois law governed the issues of both liability and damages. Illinois law applied because 1) Illinois had a strong interest in applying its products liability law to regulate culpable conduct that occurred within its borders and to induce the design of safer products; 2) Illinois, as the designer's principal place of business and place where the alleged corporate misconduct occurred, had the most significant relationship to the issue of punitive damages; and 3) Illinois' public policy position that noneconomic damages could not be capped was a compelling interest that outweighed any interest Michigan might have on the issue of noneconomic damages, and thus, Illinois law also applied to the issue of compensatory damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a Canadian life insurance company, filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants, the Director of Insurance and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, in which it challenged the constitutionality of 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/444(1) (2004). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted summary judgment to defendants and denied the company's motion for summary judgment. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute imposed a retaliatory tax on alien insurance companies. The court first held that the tax was valid under the Uniformity Clause, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2. It had a legitimate purpose of promoting domestic industry by deterring other countries from enacting discriminatory or excessive taxes, and because the impact of the tax on foreign affairs was incidental, its imposition was not an unconstitutional intrusion into foreign affairs. Because the Uniformity Clause offered more stringent protection than the Federal Equal Protection Clause or Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, the tax did not violate equal protection either. The tax did not violate the Foreign Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The United States Supreme Court had stated that the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1011 et seq., removed all Commerce Clause restrictions on a state's taxation of insurance. Even if the Act did not remove Foreign Commerce Clause restrictions from state taxation of alien insurers, the retaliatory tax was not discriminatory given its legitimate state purpose, and its impact on the federal government's ability to speak with one voice regarding foreign commerce was negligible.</SPAN></P>

He was then sentenced and assessed fines. Due to his attempted aggravated unlawful sexual assault conviction, he was informed that he would have to register as a &quot;sexual predator&quot; for the rest of his life. He appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of three counts of attempt aggravated criminal sexual assault and one count of aggravated unlawful restraint for his attack on a jogger with a knife. He was then sentenced. The trial court also assessed fines against him. Because he was convicted of attempt aggravated criminal sexual assault, he was required to register as a &quot;sexual predator&quot; for life. On appeal, he challenged whether sufficient evidence supported the unlawful restraint conviction. He also challenged the constitutionality of the Sex Offender Registration Act, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/1 et seq. (2004), and the Sex Offender and Child Murderer Community Notification Law, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 152/101 et seq. (2004). Finally, he argued he was entitled to a credit against his assessed fines. The appellate court found the evidence supported the aggravated unlawful restraint conviction because it showed he used a pocket knife on the jogger as a deadly weapon, the statutes were constitutional since they were based on his attempt aggravated criminal sexual assault conviction, and he was entitled to have a pretrial custody credit applied to his sexual assault fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment of conviction finding defendant guilty of aggravated unlawful restraint was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmates filed an action against defendant Department of Corrections (DOC) employees after plaintiffs were injured while working in the prison kitchen. The Circuit Court of Lee County (Illinois), holding that sovereign immunity applied, dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that under 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/8(d) (2004), if defendants had sovereign immunity, exclusive jurisdiction rested in the Court of Claims. 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-7-3(a) (1996) imposed a duty of safety solely on the DOC, and thus any duty it imposed on DOC employees arose solely by virtue of their employment. Thus, the trial court properly found that the duty defendants allegedly breached arose solely from their employment. Because plaintiffs had not alleged any facts showing that defendants breached a duty to plaintiffs that arose independently of defendants' state employment, the action was considered one against the State; thus, the claims were barred by the State Lawsuit Immunity Act, 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1 (2004). Next, even if the trial court had erred in failing to address plaintiffs' motion to amend, the error was harmless because the amended complaint would have also been barred by sovereign immunity. Defendants, as supervisors, not employers, did not have a duty to plaintiffs under the Health and Safety Act, 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 225/2 and 225/3 (2004), that was independent of their employment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of three counts of first degree murder based on an accountability theory (720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(a)(3), 5-2 (2004)). He was sentenced to natural life imprisonment on each count, with all counts running concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court found that the trial court's response to a question from the jury was a direct answer to the question posed. The trial court simply related the law of felony murder, residential burglary, and accountability. Furthermore, it did not apply that law to the evidence or instruct the jury on how to do so. It remained the jury's task to apply that law to the evidence and to determine defendant's guilt. Two comments made by the prosecutor during closing arguments did not deny defendant a fair trial. One reasonable interpretation of the prosecution's comment on reliability was that he was drawing an inference on the trial court's reason for admitting the statement, i.e., that it was reliable. It did not necessarily follow that the trial court found that the statement was reliable. In addition, when the second comment was placed in context, it was clear that the prosecutor was not suggesting that the trial court already deemed the statement proper. Even if there were an error, it would be harmless as the jury was instructed that closing arguments should be confined to the evidence and reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom and that closing arguments were not evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, a juvenile, appealed the portion of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) requiring respondent to submit buccal swab saliva specimens for genetic analysis under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2004) after respondent was found to be a juvenile delinquent based upon a finding that he committed the offense of possession of a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent argued that because he was a juvenile, the compulsory extraction of his saliva and perpetual storing of his DNA profile pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2004) violated his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. In an adult criminal proceeding, the state high court found that &sect; 5-4-3 was facially constitutional. Although respondent asked the appellate court not to follow the high court case because he claimed it was wrongly decided, the appellate court declined, as it was bound to follow state high court decisions. The state high court also found that &sect; 5-4-3 was constitutional as applied to juveniles. Respondent asked the appellate court to distinguish that holding on the ground that respondent did not commit a sexual offense. The high court held, however, that a defendant's status as a nonsexual offender did not so attenuate the vital linkage between his reduced privacy interests and the State's strong interest in deterring and solving crime. Thus, the trial court did not err in applying &sect; 5-4-3 to respondent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sangamon County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a judgment that granted the motion to dismiss that defendants, the state corrections department, its director, and the state prisoner review board filed and which was directed against the complaint plaintiff inmate filed seeking the restoration of good-conduct credits, an award of meritorious good-conduct credits, and his immediate release from custody.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate received a 25-year prison sentence. More than a decade later, he filed a pro se complaint alleging multiple claims related to the calculation of his good-conduct credits. He alleged the state corrections department was retroactively applying a policy of awarding good-conduct credits at the beginning of a prisoner's sentence and then revoking them when appropriate. He claimed the policy violated his rights by taking such credits away from him before they were earned. He also alleged that the state corrections department impermissibly changed its policy from awarding such credits on a monthly basis to awarding all day-for-day good conduct credits at the start of a prisoner's sentence. Furthermore, he asserted a breach-of-contract claim. The trial court granted a motion to dismiss filed by state corrections department, its director, and the state prisoner review board. On appeal, the appellate court found that the inmate had not shown entitlement to relief because he had not exhausted his administrative remedies, he had not shown an entitlement to immediate release, and the state corrections department was permitted to calculate his good-time credits in the way it did.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners challenged the non-renewals of their insurance policies by appellee Illinois FAIR Plan Association to appellee, the Illinois Director of Insurance, who, after an administrative hearing, affirmed the FAIR Plan Association's nonrenewal of the policies. The owners then filed an administrative review action in the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois). The circuit court affirmed the order. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The FAIR Plan Association decided not to renew any of the owners' insurance policies because the owners' properties had an unusually high loss ratio. The owners argued that the Association's decision not to renew their insurance policies violated the Illinois FAIR Plan, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/522 et seq. (2004). On appeal, the court found that (1) 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/524 (2004) did not apply because there were no conclusions of property inspectors at issue, and 5/524 said nothing about the renewal or nonrenewal of existing FAIR Plan policies; (2) the Association's decision not to renew the owners' policies complied with 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/525 (2004) and the approved underwriting standards; and (3) there was no deprivation of due process in either the notice of nonrenewal under 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/143.17(a) (2004), or in the appeal to the Director of Insurance under 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/143.23 (2004). However, the court clarified that if any contract buyer had any insurable interest in the owners' property, the buyer could not be denied FAIR Plan insurance coverage on the property upon reapplication simply because of the owners' claims history.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-612 (2004) was unconstitutionally vague and that it swept too broadly and punished innocent conduct. The appellate court held that &sect; 12-612 was not so vague that it violated due process of law under the facts of the case. However, the appellate court agreed with defendant that the statute required no criminal mental state and potentially punished innocent conduct. The appellate court noted that the statute was not violated unless a defendant intended and designed a compartment to conceal, hide, and prevent discovery of it or its contents by law enforcement officers. The statute did not require that contraband or the fruits or tools of crime be found in the compartment. The appellate court disagreed with the State that the plain language of the statute did not criminalize the concealment of legally possessed items in the compartment. Applying the rational basis test, the appellate court concluded that 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-612 (2004) violated the due process provisions of the United States and Illinois Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) dismissed two counts of plaintiff customer's complaint against defendant storage facility after it sold the customer's property stored with it because of overdue rent payments. Count one alleged that the statutory storage facility act permitting the sale violated the state constitution's due process clause, and count two alleged violation of the state statutory consumer fraud act. The customer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer entered into a contract with the storage facility for the rental of a storage locker in order to store his personal property. He made his monthly payments for the first two months. He was unable to make the rental payments for the next two months. Thereafter, he called the storage facility and was told his belongings had been auctioned off. According to him, he never received notice of the auctioning off of his property in order to enforce the lien created under 770 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 95/3 (2004). He demanded the return of any balance remaining from the lien sale and received no response. He filed a complaint alleging the state storage act statute violated his state constitutional due process rights because it did not provide him adequate lien sale notice and that the storage facility's conduct violated the state's statutory consumer fraud act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/2 (2004). Both claims were dismissed. On appeal, the appellate court found that dismissal of the due process contention was proper as the customer had not alleged the involvement of a state actor but also found that a violation of the state's statutory consumer fraud act had been adequately pled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment dismissing the customer's state due process claim was affirmed. However, the trial court's judgment dismissing the customer's statutory consumer fraud act claim was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court, upon reconsideration, quashed defendant's arrest and suppressed the evidence obtained contemporaneous with and subsequent to defendant's unlawful arrest. The People of the State of Illinois appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties agreed that, in compliance with Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-33-3-1 (1998) of Indiana's fresh pursuit statute, the Chicago police were properly in fresh pursuit of defendant, whom the Chicago police believed had committed a felony in the State of Illinois. However, defendant contended that his arrest was unlawful in that the arrest occurred in the State of Indiana and the Chicago police officers who arrested defendant disregarded Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-33-3-2 (1998), the portion of Indiana's fresh pursuit statute that required out-of-state police officers who effected an arrest inside the State of Indiana to bring the person arrested before an Indiana judge for a hearing regarding the lawfulness of the arrest. On appeal, the court found that the arrest was unlawful because the Chicago police officers acted in the absence of appropriate statutory authority when they disregarded Indiana's statutory directive that they present defendant to an Indiana judge for review of the lawfulness of the arrest in Indiana. In addition, the application of the exclusionary rule was necessary in that a contrary interpretation would have rendered empty the mandate of the Indiana fresh pursuit statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and solicitation to commit murder. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to consecutive terms of 45 years and 20 years in prison, and required defendant to register as a sex offender pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act and the Sex Offender and Child Murderer Community Notification Law. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress defendant's inculpatory statements to police. The appellate court disagreed, finding that defendant's statements were voluntary. The appellate court further noted that defendant's changing stories and dead-end leads only perpetuated her detention, as they necessitated further investigation. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on second-degree murder because the evidence supported a finding that defendant's actions were the result of provocation. The appellate court disagreed, concluding that the 17 days that elapsed between the injury suffered by defendant at the hands of one of the persons defendant sought to murder was more than enough time for the voice of reason and humanity to be heard. The appellate court also upheld the solicitation conviction, noting that the intended victims of the solicitation differed from the actual murder victim. Finally, the appellate court upheld the sentence imposed for murder, after concluding that the trial judge considered the necessary factors, including defendant's lack of criminal history and lack of remorse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the trial court erred in finding the mother unfit because the State failed to provide sufficient evidence showing that the child was abused or neglected in the adjudicatory hearing which was the predicate for the termination proceeding. The appellate court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal from the adjudicatory order because the mother failed to file a notice of appeal. The mother also argued that the State failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the mother was an unfit parent. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the evidence showed, inter alia, that the mother did not complete any of the recommended services and did not visit the child in foster care on a regular basis. As for the mother's contention that the trial court erred in finding that the termination of the mother's parental rights was in the child's best interests, the appellate court noted that the child was in stable, appropriate, safe home, and had bonded with the foster mother, who wished to adopt the child. Finally, the appellate court concluded that 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(b), (D)(c), (D)(m) (2002), were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of first degree murder based on an accountability theory in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. An.. 5/9-1(a)(3), 5-2 (2004). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to natural life imprisonment on each count, with all counts running concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was denied his constitutional right to an impartial jury and fair trial when the trial judge improperly applied the law to the facts and essentially directed the jury to find defendant guilty. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the trial court's response was a direct answer to the question posed; the trial court did not apply the law to the evidence or instruct the jury on how to do so. Defendant also contended that two comments made by the prosecutor during closing arguments denied defendant a fair trial. Under the plain error test, the appellate court concluded that the alleged errors were not of such a magnitude that defendant was denied a fair and impartial trial. Among other things, the appellate court found the comments to be a fair response to several of defense counsel's remarks. Finally, defendant argued that the multiple-murder sentencing statute,&nbsp;730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) (2004), violated the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The appellate court held that the sentence imposed was not disproportionate as, contrary to defendant's contention, he was not a passive participant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant, a police officer, and other officers attempted to place a combative suspect in a squad car. The next morning, he woke up with severe back pain. A few weeks later, he saw a doctor and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which indicated a bulging disc and a nerve root problem. He applied for disability benefits. Eventually, a total of five physicians were selected, pursuant to 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-115 (1998), to determine whether he was disabled. Two physicians stated he was not disabled. Two others said he was disabled, but the injury was not severe. The city police pension board then denied his disability benefits application. On appeal, the trial court affirmed. On further review, the appellate court found that the city police pension board's decision was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, that the fact that three board-selected physicians may have indicated that he was disabled was not dispositive of the disability question pursuant to 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-115 (1998) since that statute allowed an administrative board to consider other evidence of disability, and that the physicians' certificates only told part of the story.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DuPage County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered judgments that denied defendant parents' motion to dismiss plaintiff grandparent's petition to enforce an order that allowed the grandparent visitation with one of her granddaughters and held the parents in indirect civil contempt for not obeying that order. Part of the judgment also ordered them not to discuss the case with their daughter, who was the granddaughter. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the parents was married to another person; those two people had three children. The other person then died. The remaining parent remarried. The children were then adopted by the new parent. Shortly thereafter, the deceased parent's mother, the grandparent, petitioned for grandparent visitation under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/607(b) (1992). The parties entered into an agreed visitation order; visitation then occurred for the next decade. Visitation was then allegedly stopped. The grandparent petitioned to enforce the order. The parents moved to dismiss since the statute had been found unconstitutional; the trial court soon held them in civil contempt for not allowing visitation. The trial court also forbid the parents from discussing the case with the daughter. On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction over the case because the visitation was based on the order entered, not the statute, the parents could be found in contempt because the order was not void, and that part of the order forbidding them from discussing the case with the daughter violated their Fourteenth Amendment parental liberty interest rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment denying the parents' motion to dismiss and entering its judgment holding the parents in contempt was affirmed. However, its judgment directing the parents not to communicate with their daughter about the outcome of the case was vacated.</SPAN></P>

The officer found two bags of cocaine in the mailbox, a golf-ball sized bag containing approximately 10 grams, and a larger one containing approximately 36 grams. The State failed to show that defendant had the capability to maintain control and dominion over the larger bag of cocaine found in the mailbox. Defendant never possessed or had access to the key needed to open the mailbox where the larger bag was found. Defendant conceded that he possessed the smaller bag of cocaine.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The warrant had not been obtained from the presiding judge, and defense counsel was neither informed of the warrant nor present during the photographing session. The presiding judge barred the evidence as a sanction for violating Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 413(b). The presiding judge thereafter denied the State's Rule 413 motion for photos. The court affirmed, holding first that it had jurisdiction to consider the appeal under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(a)(1). Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 413 rather than 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/108-4 (2004) governed the obtaining of the photographs. The State violated Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 413 by not providing notice to defense counsel. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in suppressing the evidence as a sanction for the discovery misconduct. Not all evidence regarding defendant's alleged circumcision had been excluded, and presentation of the excluded evidence would not provide meaningful corroboration for the victim's underlying claims. Finally, the State's contention that the trial court erred in denying its subsequent Rule 413 motion was not a matter that could be reviewed as the denial did not result in a suppression of evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former state's attorney filed a petition for writ of mandamus against defendants, a governor, a revenue director, an economic development director, and a comptroller to obtain a cost-of-living adjustment and back salary that he believed he had been denied as the result of the passage of a public act aimed at preventing state officials from obtaining cost of living increases. The public act had been enacted while he was working as a state's attorney. The petition was filed because he had requested that various officials see to it that he get the amount he believed he was entitled to and they had either not responded or had informed him that they were not authorized to pay to him the requested amount. The trial court dismissed the petition and found that even though the state supreme court had found the public act unconstitutional in Jorgensen, the unconstitutional part pertained only to judicial salaries, which could not be diminished due to Ill. Const. VI, &sect; 14. On appeal, the appellate court found that Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19, regarding state's attorneys, did not contain a similar provision and, thus, the public act used to deny his COLA was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and solicitation to commit murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held, inter alia, that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress defendant's inculpatory statement to police because the statement was voluntary; defendant did not suffer any mental or physical affliction, was informed of her Miranda rights, and was provided with food, drink, and the use of a restroom. The appellate court also concluded that defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on second degree murder where there was no evidence of provocation. Next, the appellate court upheld defendant's conviction for solicitation, noting that it was based on defendant's orchestration of the death of a victim separate from the victim murdered and thus, was not supported by the same evidence as defendant's murder conviction. The trial court was not remiss in failing to sua sponte conduct an inquiry into defendant's fitness to stand trial as there was no evidence defendant was anything other than interested, rational, and appropriate. Defendant's sentence, within the statutory guidelines, was upheld. Finally, the appellate court concluded that there was no error in the order requiring defendant to register as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the denial of his petition for habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted of, inter alia, drug-induced homicide, now 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3.3(a) (2004) after defendant gave the victim cocaine and she died from the cocaine's adverse effects on her. Defendant was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the drug-induced homicide. His convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal; his subsequent petition for postconviction relief was dismissed. Thereafter, he filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he argued that the drug-induced homicide statute was unconstitutional. The trial court denied defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus after holding the statute was constitutional. On appeal, the appellate court found that defendant could challenge the constitutionality of a statute in a habeas corpus proceeding. It then rejected defendant's contentions that the statute was overbroad and vague since the statute required that the death be proximately caused by the knowing delivery of a controlled substance. The appellate court also found that defendant's 30-year prison sentence was not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense, which involved the death of a person.</SPAN></P>

In deciding the issue of custody, the trial court considered the factors enumerated in 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/602(a) (2004). The trial court found that the child had a close relationship with both parents. The child had no difficulty in either her father's home or her mother's home. Neither parent suffered from mental or physical maladies that would have precluded them from parenting the child. Based on the &sect; 602(a) factors, the trial court found that the father and the mother were equally qualified to care for the child. Because the parties were equal on these factors, the trial court looked to other relevant factors. One factor was that the child was African-American and Caucasian and that, as an African-American woman, the mother was able to provide the child with the support she would need in a world that was potentially hostile to biracial individuals. This factor tipped the scales slightly in favor of the mother. It was permissible for race to be considered as long as it was not the sole factor. The trial court carefully weighed the eight statutory factors along with race.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother filed a petition for grandparent visitation with the parents' children pursuant to &sect; 607(b) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, 750 Ill.

The appeals court found that because the provisions of &sect; 607(b) allowing for grandparent visitation were inoperative, they conferred no subject matter jurisdiction to hear the grandmother's petition. However, despite invoking &sect; 607(b), her petition framed a case for grandparent visitation, and because the court had subject matter jurisdiction over cases concerning grandparent visitation pursuant to the common law, the court had subject matter jurisdiction over the grandmother's petition. Because the grandmother had a legal right to pursue her contract claims and asserted this right in good faith, the forbearance of her claims under a previous agreement provided valid consideration for the parties' June 15, 1995, agreement. Because the June 15, 1995, agreed order was not void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or lack of consideration, it remained in effect.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2004), defendant was required to submit a DNA sample. Pursuant to &sect; 5-4-3(j), he was also required to a $ 200 genetic marker analysis fee. A $ 10 DNA collection fee was also imposed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the compulsory extraction of his blood and the storing of his DNA profile violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, that the trial court lacked authority to impose the DNA collection fee, and that he was entitled to a $20 credit against his fine. The court affirmed in part. Defendant's constitutional argument was rejected based on a prior state supreme court holding that &sect; 5-4-3 did not violate the fourth amendment. The court agreed, however, that the trial court lacked authority to impose the collection fee. The fee was not authorized under &sect;&nbsp;5-4-3. It was also not a &quot;fine&quot; or &quot;court cost&quot; that could be imposed as a condition of probation under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-6-3(b)(2) (2004) because, while it was not unreasonable, the fee did not relate to defendant's offense or to his rehabilitation. Defendant was already required to pay the analysis fee and a portion of that fee was allocated to the circuit court clerk to offset administrative cost. Finally, as the State conceded the point, defendant was entitled to a $20 credit toward his street value fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge and affirmed the DNA order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff purchasers and defendant manufacturer appealed an order by the Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois); questions were certified as to whether the circuit court erred in certifying a class of Illinois consumers under Illinois law rather than certifying a nationwide or Illinois class under California law, and whether it erred in holding that the action should not proceed as a nationwide class action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchasers, residents of Illinois and Missouri, alleged that the manufacturer, a California corporation, engaged in unfair business practices through the omission, suppression, and concealment from the public of the material fact that its microprocessor did not perform to the expectations of a reasonable consumer. The circuit court determined, inter alia, that Illinois did not have a legitimate interest in applying California law to adjudicate the dispute because California did not have the most significant relationship with the action. The circuit court denied class certification for the counts that were based upon California statutes. The appellate court found that the injury to the purchasers occurred throughout the country by virtue of the nationwide sales of computers containing the manufacturer's microprocessors. California was clearly the only state where conduct relevant to all the potential class members occurred. The circuit court erred by not first considering which state had the most significant relationship to the occurrence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified questions were answered; the order was vacated regarding class certification, and the matter was remanded with directions for the circuit court to apply California substantive law and to reconsider its class certification order in light of the applicability of California law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Illinois Gaming Board filed a disciplinary action against plaintiff casino. An administrative law judge upheld the constitutionality of the Board's administrative rules. The casino's complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Board challenging certain of the Board's rules was dismissed by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois). The casino's motion for a preliminary injunction was denied. The casino appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the appeal was pending, the Board revoked the casino's license. The casino appealed the Board's decision in the Illinois Appellate Court, Fourth District. The appellate court held that the casino sought review of a &quot;final order of the Board&quot; as that term was used in &sect; 17.1(a) (230 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 10/17.1(a) (2004)) of the Illinois Riverboat Gambling Act (RGA), 230 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 10/1 et seq. (1992). The petition in the Fourth District was a global attack on the revocation order, claiming due process violations and challenging certain administrative rules. The casino made the same facial attack on the Board's rules in the appeal. There was no reason that the issues raised in the appeal could not be resolved by the Fourth District. The cases cited by the casino did not support its claim that it could attack the Board's rules in the appeal while it was pursuing the same arguments in the Fourth District. The Fourth District was the proper place for the casino to pursue its broad-scale attack on the Board's order. The RGA created the only permissible avenue for the attack on the revocation order and authorized jurisdiction and venue only in the Fourth District.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of reckless homicide, aggravated driving under the influence (DUI), and driving with a suspended license. The reckless homicide count subsumed the aggravated DUI count, and the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to a 14-year prison term for reckless homicide and a concurrent three-year term for driving with a suspended license. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erroneously admitted cannabis discoveries into evidence because they were irrelevant and prejudicial. The appellate court agreed that the evidence as more prejudicial than probative to the central issue of defendant's impairment at the time of the accident but concluded that the error was harmless because defendant was not unfairly prejudiced by the admission of the evidence. Defendant also argued that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of reckless homicide. The appellate court disagreed, concluding that any rational trier of fact could have found defendant reckless beyond a reasonable doubt. The finding of recklessness was amply supported by, inter alia, the scientific evidence of the staggering amount of THC that remained in defendant's system eight hours after the incident. Finally, the appellate court agreed that the trial court violated defendant's right to due process by failing to advise him of the option of receiving a sentence under a newer, more favorable version of the reckless homicide statute. Remand for sentencing on the aggravated DUI conviction was permissible even though it was unsentenced and unappealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for former reckless homicide and former aggravated DUI were affirmed. Defendant's sentence for former reckless homicide was vacated, and the case was remanded for sentencing on the former aggravated DUI charge. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sued several police detectives and a city for alleged violations of his state and federal civil rights for allegedly using excessive force or allowing it to be used during an October 1992 interrogation. The trial court in the state and federal civil rights case dismissed his amended complaint, which originally had been filed in July 2003. On appeal, the claimant contended that his state-law claims alleging excessive force were not time barred, that his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims were not time barred, that the city was collaterally estopped from asserting his claims were untimely, and that his claims were timely under the doctrine of equitable tolling. The appellate court found that his excessive force claim did not necessarily undermine the validity of his murder convictions, and, thus, his civil rights claims began to accrue as soon as the alleged use of excessive force occurred; since they were filed 10 years later, they were barred under the applicable two-year limitations period in 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-202 (2004) governing personal injury actions, he was collaterally estopped from relitigating his claims, and equitable tolling did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that &sect; 3-707, which defined the offense, contained an unconstitutional mandatory presumption. Specifically, he asserted that language in &sect; 3-707 that stated that a person, such as defendant, who produced in court satisfactory evidence that the vehicle he was operating was insured at the time of his arrest could not be convicted of violating the statute, shifted the burden to defendant to produce evidence of his innocence. The court disagreed, finding &sect; 3-707 to be constitutionally sound. The statutory offense was for the failure to produce evidence of insurance and the only proof necessary was that defendant did not produce such evidence when asked for it. Violation of the statute did not create a presumption that defendant did not have insurance. The saving provision did not shift the burden to defendant to disprove he failed to produce evidence of insurance. Rather, it provided defendant with a way to avoid conviction, a legislative &quot;gift&quot; best described as an act of grace. The procedure allowed by the statute did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that defendant's constitutional protections against the invasion of privacy under U.S. Const. amend IV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 were not offended. Further, the investigator did not intend that his communications with defendant would remain private. Therefore, there was no electronic communication as defined by 720 Ill. Comp. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to five years' imprisonment and ordered defendant to pay $ 1,224. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the fines and fees imposed by the trial court and contended that the extraction of his blood and perpetual storing of his DNA violated the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Among other things, the appellate court concluded that the Spinal Cord Fund fee violated defendant's due process rights because the fee was not reasonably related to the offense for which defendant was convicted. In addition, the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund penalty was stricken because, under the plain language of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 240/10(c) (2004), the penalty could only be ordered if no other fine was imposed, and the trial court imposed other fines. Defendant was not, however, entitled to credit toward the fee he was ordered to pay the Trauma Center Fund, as 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 105/27.6(c) (2002) expressly indicated that the fee was not be considered a part of a fine for purposes of any reduction. The appellate court also upheld the order for extraction of defendant's blood and storage of defendant's DNA, finding that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2004) was constitutional as applied to defendant and on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Spinal Cord Fund fee and Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund penalty were stricken. The costs and fees order was amended to reflect a credit of $ 504 for the $ 500 controlled substance assessment and the $ 4 traffic and criminal conviction surcharge. The trial court's order that the $ 5-per-day credit could not be applied to the $ 100 Trauma Center Fund penalty and order regarding the extraction and storing of defendant's DNA were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for the 9th Judicial Circuit, Knox County, Illinois, which denied his motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The postconviction motion asserted ineffective assistance of counsel. However, on appeal, the inmate's sole contention was that he should be given one additional day of sentence credit because he was in custody before he was convicted on a charge of aggravated battery for 113 days, not the 112 days he was credited. The State argued that the issue was waived because it was not presented in the original postconviction motion. The court disagreed. 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-3 (2000) stated that any claim of substantial denial of constitutional rights not raised in the original petition was waived. Further, decisions by the Illinois Supreme Court prohibited appellate courts from excusing the failure to raise such issues in an original petition. However, the issue of sentence credit was a statutory right, not a substantial constitutional issue. Thus the prohibition in &sect; 122-3 and the case law did not apply. As it was mandatory under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-7(b) (2000) that credit be given for presentence incarceration, and as the State conceded that the inmate was entitled to the 113 day credit, the court modified the trial court's order to reflect the correct credit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Crawford County (Illinois), which granted custody of the minor child to petitioner maternal grandparents under the custody provisions of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act (Marriage Act), 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/601 et seq. (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother of the child had surrendered physical custody of the child to the grandparents in November 2002 when the child was almost four years old. At the time that the grandparents petitioned for custody, the child had not been in the physical custody for either parent for more than two years. The father responded to the petition and also filed a counterpetition for a change of custody. After a bench trial, the trial court awarded custody to the grandparents, finding that they had met their burden of showing good cause to overcome the superior rights of the father. On appeal, the court rejected the father's assertion that In re R.L.S., which addressed procedural and standing requirements under the Probate Act of 1975, 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-5(b) (2004), needed to be incorporated into the Marriage Act in order to protect the rights of the natural parent. The Marriage Act adequately afforded due process protections to natural parents. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the award of custody to the grandparents based upon evidence that the child had developed a very close relationship with the grandparents and that the child was well adjusted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of driving under the influence of alcohol under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-501(a)(2) (1998), and driving under the influence of alcohol with a blood alcohol content of .08 grams per deciliter or more under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-501(a)(1) (1998). The Circuit Court of Vermilion County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to 18 months' probation and 75 hours' community service. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought dismissal of the charges because the State failed to bring him to trial within 160 days after defendant filed a demand for a speedy trial in a traffic case that had been initiated prior to the instant action. The appellate court concluded that defendant's demand for a speedy trial in the traffic case had no force in the present case because statutory law did not require the State to join the felonies in the instant action with the misdemeanor charged by uniform citation and complaint in the traffic case. Defendant also argued that he was deprived of his constitutional right to due process when the State destroyed blood samples before defendant had the opportunity to have an independent examination made. The appellate court found no error, as defendant failed to prove that the State destroyed the blood samples in bad faith. The admission of evidence of the death of the passenger was not error, but was an indispensable part of a narrative the jury had to hear to determine who was the driver. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol was affirmed, but the conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol with a blood alcohol content of .08 grams per deciliter or more was vacated under the one act, one crime rule.</SPAN></P>
