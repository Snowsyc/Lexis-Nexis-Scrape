</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree aggravated robbery of a convenience store. During opening arguments, his counsel offered an alibi defense. The State objected because it had not been notified of the defense. The trial court precluded defendant's testimony on that matter. The appellate court upheld his conviction, and the state supreme court granted review. The state supreme court found that defense counsel had an obligation to understand the basic rules of discovery. Because the substance of the precluded testimony was apparent, a formal offer of proof was unnecessary. Defendant's credibility was damaged by preclusion of his testimony. The State had the burden of proving defendant was at the scene of the crime, but it could be prejudiced by not having an opportunity to investigate his alibi. The trial court failed to consider a continuance to rectify the prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree. The district court sentenced the defendant to prison and he was put on conditional release for 5 years. The defendant violated conditions of his release, his release was revoked, and he was placed in prison. The district court denied his petition for postconviction relief, the Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the revocation, and the defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a condition of his release, the defendant was to have no contact with minors. The defendant argued that the trial court erred because: (1) the rules which allowed the prison commissioner to administer his conditional release violated Minn. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, the separation of powers provision; and (2) the no contact with minors provision was unreasonable. The Minnesota Supreme Court held that the trial court had not erred because: (1) the commissioner's statutory authority over supervised and conditional release operated within and did not impede the court's sentencing authority. Thus, the defendant did not meet his burden of showing that the commissioner's statutory authority over supervised and conditional release violated separation of powers; and (2) the no contact with minors condition was reasonably related to the defendant's conviction for criminal sexual conduct with a 4-year-old, and the term &quot;contact&quot; could not be interpreted so broadly as to unduly restrict the defendant's liberty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Minnesota Secretary of State referred a proposed petition to recall the Attorney General to the Chief Justice for review, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 211C.05, subd. 1 (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition stated as grounds for recall both malfeasance and nonfeasance based on the same conduct, that the Attorney General failed in his duties and as a lawyer to defend the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.293, in a case resulting in an order striking down the crime of sodomy as unconstitutional. Petitioners' claim was really one of nonfeasance. The Rules of Professional Conduct could not provide a legal basis for a recall petition because failure as a lawyer could not be the basis for a recall petition. Neither the constitution nor the recall statute addressed an official's failure to abide by professional norms as a basis for recall. The requirement in Minn. Stat. &sect; 211C.01, subd. 3 that the failure to perform be repeated indicated the legislature did not intend an official to be subject to recall for a single failure to perform a required duty. Because the facts as alleged by petitioners did not establish repeated failure to perform the asserted duty to defend the constitutionality of statutes, the conduct alleged did not satisfy the legal standard for nonfeasance in the recall statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators appealed from the Minnesota Tax Court's decision affirming an order of the commissioner of revenue, which assessed Minnesota state income taxes, penalties, and interest for each of the taxable years from 1987 through 1993.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators alleged their residence and domicile were in Nevada. They conducted a multi-state business. However, during the relevant period, they maintained a residence in Minnesota for which they received homestead status, and spent the majority of their time in Minnesota. Relators did not pay any Minnesota income tax, even after their tax accountant advised them of a then newly enacted change in Minnesota law providing for income taxation of nondomiciliary residents. The Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the tax court's decision assessing income taxes and penalties for years in which nondomiciliary residents were taxed. The court rejected relators' argument that the tax on their entire income generated primarily from transactions occurring outside of Minnesota violated the Commerce Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, as taxation under the circumstances did not implicate the Commerce Clause. No discrimination or undue burden on interstate commerce was shown. Penalties were justified, as it was not reasonable for relators to disregard their accountant's advising them of the change in law and continue believing no Minnesota tax return was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax court's judgment was affirmed. Minnesota's income taxation on the entire income of relator nondomiciliary residents did not violate the Commerce Clause. Relators did not show discrimination or an undue burden on interstate commerce. Late filing and payment penalties were justified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the court appeals, which affirmed the district court's decision that appellant was responsible for storage fees for his automobile, which was seized under the forfeiture provisions of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.1217 (1998) (repealed, recodified, amended 2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police seized and stored appellant's automobile pursuant to a vehicle forfeiture statute. The vehicle was ultimately returned to appellant after a judicial forfeiture determination ordering return of the vehicle. However, when appellant went to retrieve his car, the facility refused to give appellant possession until he paid storage fees that were greater in amount than the value of the car. The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed the lower courts' judgments that appellant was responsible for the fees. The forfeiture statute was silent on the question of storage fees. A companion impoundment statute, enacted at the same time as the subject statute, absolved the government from liability for storage fees. This demonstrated that the legislature affirmatively chose not to so provide in the forfeiture statute. Moreover, by giving the government agency the right, title, and interest in a seized vehicle, the forfeiture statute made the agency responsible for the vehicle during seizure. As the agency was responsible for and exercised unfettered control over the vehicle during seizure, requiring it to pay storage fees accruing during that time was consistent with the statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the court of appeals was reversed. Appellant owner was not responsible for storage fees for vehicle seized under Minnesota vehicle forfeiture statute, when judicial forfeiture determination ordered return of vehicle to appellant. Statute made government responsible for vehicle during seizure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant board of regents of a state university challenged the Minnesota Court of Appeals' reversal of the trial court's finding that 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1367(d) did not toll the statute of limitations for respondents' Minnesota Human Rights Act claims during the pendency of their federal district court action, and that respondents' claims were not equitably tolled while their federal district court action was pending.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents brought an action in federal court against appellant board of regents of a state university alleging a violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA). Appellant was an &quot;arm&quot; of the State, and was entitled to the protections of U.S. Const. amend. XI. Therefore, the federal district court did not have jurisdiction over the MHRA claims once U.S. Const. amend. XI was asserted by appellant. Respondents then filed the MHRA claim in state district court after the 45-day statute of limitations set forth in Minn. Stat. &sect; 363.14, subd. 1(a)(1) (2000) had expired. Because Congress could not, absent valid abrogation of sovereign immunity, extend federal judicial power against nonconsenting states, it followed that Congress could not impose a penalty on a state defendant for being named, without its consent, as a defendant in federal court. To allow such a result would have penalized the nonconsenting state for the other party's failed attempt to sue the state in federal court. Appellant's waiver of sovereign immunity for MHRA claims timely filed in state court did not diminish its U.S. Const. amend. XI protections from federal judicial power with respect to MHRA claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of appellate court was reversed, and trial court's judgment was reinstated. The federal supplemental jurisdiction statute did not toll the state statute of limitations for the Minnesota Human Rights Act claim against appellant board of regents of a state university, and trial court acted within its discretion in deciding that equitable tolling did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant pleaded guilty to three controlled substance crimes charges, the presentence investigation report indicated he enjoyed selling the drugs for money, and recommended $ 20,000 in fines. However, the trial court imposed the minimum fines under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.101, subd. 3(a) (1998), which amounted to $ 228,000, plus surcharges of $ 45,600, for a total of $ 273,600. Appellant's petition for postconviction relief to vacate or decrease the fines was denied. The appeals court affirmed, finding the fines were not excessive. On appeal, the court reversed as the fines were grossly disproportionate. They were 1,368 times greater than the value of the drugs involved, and it would take 300 years for appellant to pay them. The fines were substantially higher than the fines authorized for other similarly ranked offenses. Under the federal guidelines, he would have been fined only $ 15,000, and most states did not impose mandatory minimum fines and had maximum fines less than the fines imposed against appellant. Thus the fines and surcharges violated the Excessive Fines Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order reversed and remanded; the fines and surcharges imposed for appellant's controlled substance crime convictions were grossly disproportionate and therefore in violation of state and federal constitutions thereby creating an undue financial hardship for appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found that respondent attorney committed fraud within the scope of his employment, arising out of a real estate transaction. The trial court ordered treble damages against respondent attorney, but not against his law firm. The court of appeals affirmed the damages award against respondent attorney, but also held appellant law firm vicariously liable, and liable for treble damages under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 481.07, 481.071. The supreme court reversed both awards, holding that when the legislature adopted New York's penal code by enacting &sect; 481.071, it in effect adopted New York's interpretation of the word &quot;party&quot; in the statute. New York caselaw held that &quot;party&quot; referred only parties actually involved in a lawsuit, and not parties to other legal transactions. The result was the same with respect to &sect; 481.07. In addition, the statutes were penal in nature (providing for misdemeanor offenses) and were to be strictly construed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that plaintiff was ineligible for benefits under Minn. Stat. &sect; 423B.10(1)(a) (1998) because she did not reside with decedent at the time of his death. Plaintiff claimed that she was eligible for benefits and that, if she was not eligible, then the statute violated the federal and state equal protection clauses, U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The supreme court found that plaintiff was ineligible to receive benefits because she did not reside with decedent at the time of his death. Because the equal protection challenge to the statute did not involve a suspect classification or a fundamental right, the supreme court reviewed the challenge under a rational basis standard. The statute was presumed to be valid and was sustained where the classification drawn by the statute was rationally related to the legitimate state interests of encouraging spouses to stay with and care for pensioners and preventing sham marriages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, charged with stalking in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.749, subd. 2(7) (1996), was found guilty. Prior to sentencing, the statute was declared unconstitutional and the trial court dismissed. The State's amended complaint, charging appellant under a different statutory subdivision, was dismissed because Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.035 barred retrial. The court of appeals reversed because there was no resolution of two counts of the original complaint, so the amended complaint merely continued an incomplete prosecution. Appellant argued that retrial violated double jeopardy. The court affirmed. Although appellant's conviction was overturned due to the unconstitutionality of the charging statute, double jeopardy did not require that appellant be allowed to avoid prosecution simply because the statute under which he was originally charged and tried was declared unconstitutional. The trial court's subsequent orders were not acquittals regardless of how they were labeled. They were based on the court's resolution of a legal issue--the constitutionality of the charging statute--and did not involve any weighing of the facts. Therefore the merits of the charges were not reached.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The double jeopardy clauses of state and U.S. constitutions did not bar appellant's retrial under an amended complaint charging appellant under a separate statutory subsection with offenses that arose from the same conduct as the offenses charged in the original complaint.</SPAN></P>

Appellants challenged the appellate courts' decision, arguing that the prevailing wage amendment did not violate Minn. Const. art.

The court concluded that the prevailing wage amendment violated the single subject provision of the Minnesota constitution. However, the constitutional construction of Minn. art IV, &sect; 17, did not require the entire law to be declared unconstitutional.

Appellant doctor's motion to dismiss alleging the affidavit was insufficient was granted and appellee's reconsideration request was denied. The appellate court reversed and held appellee should have been given time to file a supplemental affidavit. Appellant challenged that holding. The court reversed. The court held the affidavit did not meet the statutory requirements of Minn.

Nevertheless, non-payment of debt was not criminally punishable under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.52, subd. 2(5)(a).

Although the purpose of bail was to ensure the accused's appearance and submission to the court's judgment, Minn. Const. art.

Stat. &sect; 97A.015, subd. 36 includes &quot;constructive possession&quot;; [3]-Feeding a bear in order to keep it in one place while a radio collar is affixed to it is a significant form of exerting control over the animal; [4]-The appellate court rejected relator's void-for-vagueness challenge to Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Although a judge misspoke when he sentenced appellant to 60 months in prison and supervised release, as opposed to the mandatory conditional release required under the DWI statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.276, subd. 1(d); therefore, the five-year term was conditional release rather than supervised release under Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.05, subd. 1 (2006); [2]-Both supervised release and conditional release began upon defendant's release from prison, and the terms (in this case a two-year supervised release term and a five-year conditional release term) ran concurrently with one another; therefore, in resentencing defendant following a violation, the period of his re-incarceration was not limited to the remainder of his supervised-release term; [3]-Because the maximum sentence was seven years plus the term of conditional release, defendant's sentence did not violate due-process guarantees.</SPAN></P>

Assault-harm was a general-intent crime, which required only that the defendant engaged intentionally in specific, prohibited conduct.

Stat. &sect; 609.377, subd. 1, was proper because, construing the statute as a whole, reading &quot;anything less than substantial bodily harm&quot; to include emotional harm did not create conflicting interpretations. Further, if the legislature had intended for a conviction under &sect; 609.377 to require proof of bodily harm, it could have easily included statutory language; [2]-Defendant's conduct fell under the plain meaning of conduct prohibited by &sect; 609.377, subd. 1, and thus was included in the core class of conduct prohibited.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The medical assistance program, Minn. Stat. &sect; 256B.0659 (2012), allowed family members to become personal care assistants (PCAs) if they met several requirements, including being employed by a personal-care-assistance-provider agency. The legislature adopted Minn. Stat. &sect; 268.035, subd. 20(20), which made PCAs who provided direct care to an immediate family member ineligible for unemployment benefits, because it was advised that a fraud problem existed that was more likely to occur with immediate-family-member PCAs. DEED, however, offered no evidence or legal authority to the legislature to support this allegation of fraud. The legislation, therefore, without any factual support for the hypothesized manipulation of the system by immediate-family-member PCAs, was based purely on assumptions rather than facts. Because the amendment treated similarly situated PCAs differently and there was no rational basis for the different treatment, the law violated the Equal Protection Clause, Minn.

The appellate court found that the state failed to carry its burden of proving that defendant's articulated gender-neutral reason for her peremptory strikes of two male jurors was pretextual and, thus, defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Neither United States nor Minnesota constitutional law has ever recognized the existence of a fundamental right to engage in such conduct. The imposition of criminal penalties for refusing to submit to a constitutionally reasonable police search, namely, a chemical test of blood, breath, or urine, supported by probable cause, is a reasonable means to facilitate a permissible state objective. Therefore, Minnesota's chemical-test-refusal statute did not violate defendant's substantive due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that appellants' challenge to the constitutionality of the city's rental inspection ordinance presented a justiciable controversy. Appellants were presenting a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the rental inspection ordinance, and the constitutional issue that they had raised was neither hypothetical nor abstract. The city had actually begun enforcing the rental inspection ordinance against appellants. The city had sought not just one, but three separate administrative warrants over a four-year period to inspect their properties, which appellants had been forced to defend. The city had also indicated that it would continue to seek administrative warrants to inspect appellants' properties. Accordingly, appellants' claims were based on an actual controversy, and appellants were seeking specific declaratory relief--a judgment on the constitutionality of the administrative warrant provisions in the city's rental dwelling licensing code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the court of appeals' decision and remanded the matter to that court to consider the merits of appellants' challenge to the rental inspection ordinance under the Minnesota Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Designer argued, inter alia, that the lawsuits was time-barred, and that the 2007 amendments to Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051 (2010) did not revive actions for contribution or indemnity that had been previously extinguished by a prior version of the statute of repose. The supreme court agreed. First, the plain and ordinary meaning of the language was that the operative date of the statute was June 30, 2006, and it applied to causes of action for contribution that were not extinguished by the statute of repose as of June 30, 2006. Second, the effective date language of the statute did not &quot;clearly and manifestly&quot; demonstrate an intent to retroactively revive claims that were previously extinguished by a statute of repose before June 30, 2006. Had the Legislature desired to do so, it could have used explicit language to clearly and manifestly express such an intent. It did not. Contractor's contribution cause of action against designer was not retroactively revived by the 2007 amendments to Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, and therefore designer was entitled to dismissal of contractor's action for contribution.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court granted the successor corporation's request for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contracted with the successor corporation's predecessor to build a state highway bridge. Nearly 45 years later, the bridge collapsed, killing and injuring several people. The State's legislature passed compensation statutes,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.7391 et seq. (2010), and the State settled with survivor-claimants. The State cross-claimed against the successor corporation for Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.7394, subd. 5(a) (2010) reimbursement. The trial court denied its motion to dismiss. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that: (1) the &quot;notwithstanding&quot; clause in Minn.

Stat. &sect; 541.051 (2010) statute of repose; (2) the compensation statutes were rationally related to a legitimate government interest; (3) they did not substantially impair contractual rights; and (4) the settlement releases did not bar the claim against the successor corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by refusing to allow defendant to present alternative perpetrator evidence because it had an inherent tendency to connect a third party to the commission of the victim's murder. The evidence showed that: (1) a witness called another witness and told him that someone who went by initials that were the same as the third party's initials shot the victim; (2) the shooter had those initials tattooed on his arm; (3) three days before the shooting the victim spoke to the third party on the phone; (4) the third party's physical description was similar to the shooter's description; (5) the third party drove a car that matched a car seen at the scene of the shooting; and (6) the third party was arrested for possession of a firearm without a permit several months before the shooting but was not in police custody on the day of the shooting. The error was not harmless because there was a reasonable possibility that the jury may have reached a different result had the evidence been admitted given a lack of physical evidence connecting defendant to the shooting and only one eyewitness identified defendant as the shooter.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 609.52, subd. 2(3)(i) (2010), and, thus, could not established that the prosecution of her involved an equal-protection violation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with issuing dishonored checks with a value of more than $ 500 in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.535, subd. 2a(a)(1) (2010), which was a felony. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, and argued that the sentencing disparity between the dishonored-check statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.535 (2010), and the theft-by-check statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.52, subd. 2(3)(i) (2010), violated her constitutional right to equal protection. The trial court denied that challenge but also found the issue should be certified. Thus, it certified a question for appellate review about whether the disparity in punishment under the two statutes violated defendant's equal protection rights. The appellate court answered the certified question in the negative. The state supreme court found that defendant could not maintain a Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 equal protection claim because defendant's specific conduct in writing  dishonored checks could not also support a conviction against her for theft by check because the evidence did not show she had the specific intent to defraud any of the merchants when she wrote her checks, which was an element of theft by check.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 609.3455, subd. 6, did not require any additional fact-finding before the sentencing court imposed the mandatory 10-year conditional release term for first-degree criminal sexual conduct committed on or after August 1, 2005. Here, petitioner pleaded guilty to a charge of first-degree criminal sexual conduct that occurred on or about 2003 through 2006. Because &sect; 609.3455, subd. 6, did not require any additional fact-finding before the sentencing court imposed the mandatory 10-year conditional release term for first-degree criminal sexual conduct committed on or after August 1, 2005, the rule announced in Blakely did not apply. When petitioner pleaded guilty, he admitted the allegations in the complaint that he committed first-degree criminal sexual conduct in 2006. Consequently, no additional fact-finding was required to determine that criminal sexual conduct occurred after August 1, 2005, and therefore the 10-year conditional release term automatically applied.</SPAN></P>

A person of ordinary care and prudence, viewing the totality of the circumstances objectively, would entertain an honest and strong suspicion that defendant violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.714, subd. 1a. Therefore, the officer's warrantless arrest of defendant was supported by probable cause under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court lacked authority to order him to pay restitution to the victim because the victim did not submit a request for restitution. Specifically, he argued that restitution could be awarded under Minn. Stat. &sect; 611A.04 (2010) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 611.045 (2010) only when a victim submitted a request for restitution. The State contended that the circuit court had the authority under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.10 (2010) to order restitution even in the absence of a victim's request. The court upheld the decision because the plain language of &sect; 609.10, Minn. Stat. &sect; 611A.04 (2010), and Minn. Stat. &sect; 611A.045 (2010) indicated that a district court's authority to award restitution was not limited to only the circumstance where the victim requests restitution. In order to be considered at the sentencing or dispositional hearing, all information regarding restitution needed to be received by the court administrator of the appropriate court at least three business days before the sentencing or dispositional hearing. The language did not prevent a circuit court from considering or awarding restitution in the absence of a victim's request for restitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relater, a real estate taxpayer, sought review of a decision of the Minnesota Tax Court, which upheld a decision of respondent, the County of Dakota. The taxpayer had set forth the action after it was denied a tax exemption for a building that it claimed was exempt from property taxes under Minn. Stat. &sect; 272.02, subd. 38 (2010).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was undisputed that the the property that was purchased by was to be used as a church for an exempt purpose. Therefore, the issue before was whether the taxpayer acquired the property for purposes of Minn. Stat. &sect; 272.02, subd. 38(b), before July 1, 2008. The term &quot;acquired&quot; as used in Minn. Stat. &sect; 272.02, subd. 38(b), was not defined by statute or caselaw. The County argued that the taxpayer did not acquire legal or equitable title to the property before the September 8, 2008, closing. The taxpayer argued that it had equitable title before July 1, 2008, because of an oral understanding that was sufficient to transfer equitable title, and therefore was entitled to an exemption for 2008. The taxpayer did not argue that it had legal title before July 1, 2008, and conceded that possession was not sufficient to satisfy Minn. Stat. &sect; 272.02, subd. 38(b). The court upheld the decision because several conditions of the taxpayer's oral understanding remained unfulfilled as of July 1, 2008. Thus, the taxpayer could not have had equitable title to the property on that date. Under general contract law, unfulfilled conditions prevent enforcement of a contract.</SPAN></P>

The candidate filed a petition seeking that her name be placed on the general election ballot or, in the alternative, declaring the primary election results invalid. The auditor opposed the petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate was not affiliated with a major political party. Therefore, she had to be nominated by petition as provided in Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 204B.07 and 204B.08 (2008). The auditor rejected 207 of the 556 signatures, most of which were rejected for reasons of defective addresses. The court found that the candidate made no showing that the nominating-petition requirements of Minnesota law froze the political status quo by locking candidates of non-major parties out of the electoral process. The candidate's contention that the requirement to file a nominating petition with at least 500 valid signatures was unconstitutionally burdensome was without merit. In addition, the candidate did not prove that any differential enforcement by the auditor of the residence address requirement was the product of intentional discrimination based on the fact that the candidate was Native American. Different statutes and procedures governed voter registration and nominating petitions. Finally, the court concluded that Minn. Stat. &sect; 204C.13 (2008) barred challenges in the primary election to voter eligibility based on residence address once the ballot had been deposited into the ballot box.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue issued a tax-change notice to relator taxpayers after finding that their business structure, a &quot;captive REIT&quot; under Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.01, subd. 19 (2002), lacked a business purpose other than reducing taxes. The Commissioner thus disregarded the structure and attributed substantial additional income to the taxpayers. The Minnesota Tax Court upheld the Commissioner's decision. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the taxpayers' business structure, a bank owned all of the shares of a holding company, which owned almost all of the shares of the REIT except for those owned by bank employees. As a unitary business, the taxpayers reported their income as a group. The tax court held that the Commissioner had the authority to disregard the taxpayers' captive-REIT strategy when they organized their businesses in compliance with relevant statutes but did so in order to reduce their taxes. On appeal, the court first noted that there was not a factual dispute that the holding company was a foreign operating corporation. It then rejected the Commissioner's arguments that he had the authority to disregard the taxpayers' business structure under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 289A.35; 290.07, subd. 2; 290.20, subd. 1; and 290.34, subds. 1 and 2 (2002). The Commissioner did not cite any authority stating that Commissioner could tax according to substance rather than form when a taxpayer structured its business in full statutory compliance. If Minnesota statutes allowed a favorable tax treatment, neither the court nor the Commissioner had the power to disregard those statutes and impose a different tax treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six Minnesota residents qualifying for payments under the Minnesota Supplemental Aid--Special Diet (Special Diet) Program brought an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.

They asserted that the reductions in allotments to the program violated the terms of the unallotment statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 16A.152, subd. 4 (2008), and were unconstitutional as a violation of separation of powers. The trial court agreed with their separation-of-powers claim. The state supreme court found it unnecessary to address the constitutional argument because it determined that the executive branch did not have the authority under the unallotment statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 16A.152, subd. 4 (2008) to reduce the program's funding as a means of avoiding a deficit in the state's budget before a balanced budget was enacted; indeed, it determined that the very purpose of the unallotment statute was to give the executive branch of means of making up for unanticipated revenue shortfalls after a balanced budget was enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DNR and others petitioned the court to review the question of whether the 60-day rule, of Minn. Stat. &sect; 15.99 (2008), applied to an agency's consideration of an administrative law judge's recommended order in a contested case, rather than the 90 days allowed by Minn. Stat. &sect; 14.62, subd. 2a (2008). The court held that because the DNR lacked express and implied statutory authority to certify variance decisions by local units of government, the agency's refusal to certify the variance had no effect. Because the statutes at issue, the Lower St. Croix Wild and Scenic River Act of 1972, Minn. Stat. &sect; 103F.351, and the Minnesota Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 103F.321, did not unambiguously grant authority for the DNR to certify the city's variance decision, the DNR did not have express authority to do so. The inclusion of express authority for certification in other statutes, combined with the fact that the legislature never amended the statutory provisions relating to the DNR to expressly include authorization for a certification rule, provided important evidence that the legislature did not intend that the DNR have certification authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Commissioner of Revenue, assessed relator taxpayer for Minnesota sales tax collected in connection with his home repair and remodeling business, which he did not remit to the State. The Commissioner also assessed a use tax for failing to register the taxpayer's motor vehicle purchased in Minnesota. The Tax Court (Minnesota) upheld the assessments. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer admitted that he collected sales tax from his remodeling customers and that he did not remit that tax to the State. He argued that he did not need to remit the tax because he collected it in error. The court disagreed on appeal. The taxpayer could have charged his customers an amount for materials that already included the amount of tax paid. But once he collected amounts designated as sales tax from his customers, he owed the State that money, regardless of his intent. The plain language of Minn. Stat. &sect; 289A.31, subd. 7(e) (2008) required the taxpayer to remit the taxes he collected to the State, even if erroneously or illegally collected. Second, the assessment did not result in double taxation. The Uniformity Clause, Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, was inapplicable because Minn. Stat. &sect; 289A.31, subd. 7, applied equally to all persons, including corporations, that erroneously or illegally collect sales taxes. Since there was no differentiation in the applicability of the statute based on any class, the Equal Protection Clause also did not apply. Finally, the taxpayer waived his right to challenge the use tax assessment by waiving the issue before the tax court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the tax court.</SPAN></P>

It was not error for the district court to admit evidence of defendant's pre-arrest conduct. There was sufficient evidence that defendant knew that he was a suspect in the victim's murder. The police attempted to locate defendant, spoke to his mother, girlfriend, friend, and cousin, and requested that each tell defendant to contact the officer. Defendant did just that. The officer told defendant that he was wanted for murder, that it was defendant's &quot;chance to tell his side,&quot; and that there was a warrant issued for his arrest. Defendant responded that he was not going to turn himself in. Defendant was hiding under a bed when the police arrested him, and he made numerous statements regarding his knowledge that &quot;the police were going to be coming to where everybody was at&quot; and that he &quot;already knew&quot; that the police were looking for him.</SPAN></P>

The district court did not err when it admitted exhibits and expert testimony regarding the gang; the jury was properly instructed. The prosecutor's closing argument did not deprive appellant of a fair trial. The evidence supported the jury's finding of premeditation, and aiding and abetting.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Stevens County District Court, Minnesota, convicted defendant, pursuant to a guilty plea, of first-degree assault, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.221, subd. 1 (2008), and originally sentenced to 128 months. on remand, the district court sentenced defendant to 103 months. The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new Blakely trial and resentencing. Defendant petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the questioned presented was whether the aggravating factor of particular cruelty listed in Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.D. was an &quot;additional fact&quot; which had to be submitted to the jurors in a Blakely trial or a &quot;reason&quot; which explained why the additional facts provided the district court a substantial and compelling reason or basis to impose a sentence outside the range, and which were outside the purview of a jury. The supreme court found that the particular cruelty aggravating factor was a reason that explained why the additional facts found by the jury provided the district court a substantial and compelling basis for imposition of a sentence outside the range on the grid. Because the aggravating factor of particular cruelty was not submitted to the jury, the reasoning in pre-Blakely cases was still applicable. Under Minn. R. Crim. P. 28.04, the State could not appeal the district court's decision not to submit the abuse-of-power question to the Blakely jurors. Minn. R. Crim. P. 28.05, subd. 2 did not necessarily imply a right to challenge a district court's pretrial decision not to submit a particular question to the jurors in a Blakely trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to the finding that the decision that the aggravating factor of &quot;particular cruelty&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague; the judgment was reversed as to the order to submit the factor to the jury with a definition of &quot;particular cruelty.&quot; The judgment was reversed as to the decision to allow the State to file a post-trial appeal challenging the decision not to submit the abuse-of-power question to the jurors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the issue was whether the water containing methamphetamine stored in defendant's bong fell within the definition of &quot;mixture&quot; set forth in Minn.

The supreme court concluded that when applied to the water containing methamphetamine stored in the bong, the phrase &quot;preparation, compound, mixture, or substance&quot; was clear and free from all ambiguity. Bong water was plainly a &quot;substance&quot; because it was material of a particular kind or constitution. The bong water was a &quot;mixture&quot; because it was a &quot;substance containing a controlled substance&quot;--methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant, a 17-year-old African-American standing trial as an adult, guilty of first-degree premeditated murder in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.185(a)(1) (2008) and crime committed for the benefit of a gang. The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) entered a judgment of conviction of first-degree premeditated murder and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of release (LWOR). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two other gang members were accused of fatally shooting a rival gang member's cousin. The State presented eyewitness testimony from the rival gang member, his brother, neighbors, and defendant's admission to gang members that he shot the victim. The court upheld the conviction and sentence. First, defendant's LWOR sentence did not constitute cruel and/or unusual punishment. Defendant failed to present evidence showing an emerging consensus against sentencing 17-year-old juveniles to LWOR. Second, defendant's trial was properly joined with one codefendant's trial because the two acted in close concert. Third, the district court correctly followed the Batson analysis. Its decision to sustain a peremptory challenge to an African American juror was not clearly erroneous because the juror's belief that his cousin might have been wrongfully convicted and the fact that the juror worked with the victim's uncle were race-neutral reasons for excluding him. Finally, no prosecutorial misconduct occurred when the prosecutor referred to the real world of gangs and violence in north Minneapolis because it was used to prepare the jury for evidence from an unfamiliar world.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Commissioner of Revenue (Commissioner) issued an order assessing additional tobacco tax against relator distributor. The Commissioner denied the distributor's administrative appeal and refund claim, and the distributor appealed to the Minnesota Tax Court. The tax court granted the Commissioner's motion for partial summary judgment and denied the distributor's motion. The distributor petitioned for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributor argued that it overpaid its tobacco tax under Minn. Stat. &sect; 297F.05, subd. 3, and was entitled to a refund from January 1, 2002, through June 30, 2005. The supreme court noted that for the tax periods of May 2002 through June 30, 2003, based on the plain language of Minn. Stat. &sect; 297F.01, subd. 23 (2002), the &quot;wholesale price&quot; was the price for which the seller sold the products to the distributor. The price &quot;for which&quot; the seller sold tobacco products to the distributor was the seller's price, not the manufacturer's price. The legislature did not intend its 2003 amendments of Minn. Stat. &sect; 297F.01, subd. 23 to alter the meaning of wholesale price for purposes of the tobacco tax, such that for the tax periods of July 1, 2003, through 2005, the wholesale price for purposes of calculating the tobacco tax was the price for which the seller sold tobacco products to the distributor. Minnesota's tobacco tax did not discriminate in favor of local merchants. All tobacco products were taxed at the same rate and all were taxed at the time of the first wholesale transaction in Minnesota.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, granted respondent Port Authority of the City of St. Paul's (Port Authority) request to begin the liquidation process of revenue bonds. The district court denied appellant bondholders' petition for a receiver and their motions to vacate the 2002 and 2004 orders. The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's rulings. The bondholders petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bondholders argued that the Basic Resolution 876 Bonds were not within the purview of Minn. Stat. ch. 501B. The supreme court found that the Port Authority and the City had limited pecuniary liability. Applying to these bonds the 1993 amendment to Minn. Stat. &sect; 501B.25 altered the contractual rights of the bondholders under Basic Resolution 876. The Basic Resolution allowed the Port Authority to make changes with bondholder consent, but without bondholder consent only if those changes were not to the prejudice of any holders of general revenue bonds. Allowing the Port Authority to petition for instructions under &sect; 501B.16 gave the Port Authority more procedural rights than it possessed under the Basic Resolution. Chapter 501B could not be applied to the bonds retroactively. The district court's conclusions as to its jurisdiction under Minn. Stat. &sect; 501B.24 were erroneous. The district court had no authority and its 2002 and 2004 orders were void because they were rendered without in rem jurisdiction over the 876 Bonds. The question of whether the bondholders' motion to vacate was made within a reasonable time was better addressed by the district court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of one count of fifth-degree cocaine possession under Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.025, subd. 2(1) (2008). Before trial, defendant moved to suppress all evidence of his narcotics possession. After a contested omnibus hearing, the district court denied defendant's motion. Defendant then stipulated to the evidence using the Lothenbach procedure. The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a law enforcement officer had probable cause to arrest both occupants of the vehicle in which defendant was a front-seat passenger for cocaine found during a vehicle search because the cocaine was accessible to both the driver and defendant, and because neither of them assumed ownership of the cocaine. As there was an objective legal basis to arrest defendant for the cocaine found in the vehicle, the search that uncovered the cocaine in defendant's back pocket was a lawful search incident to arrest. The court concluded that the officer acted reasonably in detaining defendant during the vehicle search because the invasion of defendant's rights was minimal, and because the officer had a valid officer-safety concern for requesting defendant to step away from the passenger compartment while the vehicle was searched. The vehicle was already stopped, and the only change was that defendant was outside, instead of inside, the vehicle. The officer was a sole officer stopping a vehicle with two occupants. Defendant's right to be free from unreasonable searches or seizures under the Fourth Amendment and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 was not violated.</SPAN></P>

In single-seat elections, if no candidate received a majority, the candidate who received the lowest number of first-choice votes would be eliminated and his or her votes redistributed as provided in Minneapolis, Minn., Code Ord. &sect; 167.60(a)(1), with further rounds of counting until one candidate achieved a majority. The court held that there was no unequal weighting of votes because each voter had the same opportunity to rank candidates. Because not all multiple-seat elections involved reallocating surplus votes and a non-monotonic effect would not necessarily occur, facial unconstitutionality could not be found on those grounds. Any burden imposed on the right to vote was minimal, and the city asserted sufficient justifications. An equal protection claim lacked supporting authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court erred in summarily denying petitioner's amendments to his original petition as successive petitions under Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.04, subd. 3, because the filings were amendments rather than new petitions. Postconviction review of 11 of petitioner's claims, other than ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and new evidence, was barred because these claims were based on evidence in the trial record and therefore were known or should have been known at the time of the direct appeal. The court refused to review the claims under the interests of justice exception to the Knaffla rule. The court held that appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the ineffectiveness of the trial counsel, because petitioner did not show that trial counsel was ineffective. Given the DNA evidence tying petitioner to the crime scene and his statement to hospital personnel that he recalled pulling a knife from the victim's back, appellate counsel could have concluded that a claim that the evidence was not sufficient would have lacked merit on direct appeal.

He did not appeal. Several years later, he filed a pro se petition for postconviction relief and requested the appointment of counsel. The district court denied the motions, and the Court of Appeals of Minnesota affirmed, based on Minn. Stat. &sect; 611.14(2) (2008). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his petition for postconviction relief, defendant sought to withdraw his pleas on the ground that at the time he pleaded guilty he was not competent to plead guilty or waive his right to counsel because he suffered from bipolar disorder and delusions. Defendant argued that he had the right to counsel on his first review under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, and that Minn. Stat. &sect; 611.14(2) (2008), which entitled only certain postconviction petitioners convicted of felonies or gross misdemeanors to representation by the State public defender was unconstitutional. The court agreed that defendant had the right to counsel for his first review by postconviction proceeding in a misdemeanor case. However, defendant failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the recognition that misdemeanor defendants have a constitutional right to court-appointed counsel for a first review by postconviction proceeding mandated the appointment of the State public defender's office. Therefore, &sect; 611.14(2) was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff customer, a resident of Minnesota, appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Minnesota) reversing a district court and holding that the filed rate doctrine barred the customer's action for breach of contract against defendant utility, under Minn. Stat. ch. 216B. The court also separately dismissed claims against the utility presented by plaintiff out-of-state claimants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer alleged that the utility failed to inspect and maintain the point of connection between the utility's facilities and the customer's electrical equipment, as allegedly required under the tariff that the utility filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC), under Minn. Stat. &sect; 216B.05 (2008). For the utility's alleged breach of contract, the complaint sought both injunctive relief and compensatory damages. The court held that the filed rate doctrine did not bar the customer's claim for injunctive relief because the tariff required that the utility maintain some equipment, construing the complaint liberally in favor of the customer. The injunctive relief claim should be referred first to MPUC under the primary jurisdiction doctrine. The filed rate doctrine applied to claims challenging the reasonableness of a rate that MPUC established for the utility and barred claims for compensatory damages because awarding economic damages would lead to discrimination between ratepayers. The court was not competent to engage in rate analysis, given the power granted to the MPUC to set and regulate rates, under Minn. Stat. ch. 216B.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the court of appeals' ruling on the out-of-state claims because the issue was not certified by the district court and not properly before the court of appeals. The court remanded the question of whether the injunctive relief claim should be dismissed without prejudice or stayed to the district court for a disposition. The court affirmed the court of appeals' ruling that dismissed the compensatory damages claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a candidate for U.S. Senator, filed a petition seeking an order requiring respondents, the Governor of Minnesota and the Minnesota Secretary of State, to promptly prepare and countersign a certificate of election and deliver the certificate to the Secretary of the United States Senate, without awaiting the conclusion of an election contest pending in state district court under Minn. Stat. ch. 209 (2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that neither state nor federal law required the issuance of a certificate of election before the election contest was completed. The plain language of Minn. Stat. &sect; 204C.40, subd. 2 (2008), provided that no certificate could be issued until the state courts finally decided the election contest. The court disagreed with petitioner's argument that &sect; 204C.40, subd. (1), created a mandate to issue the certificate on completion of a recount and was a more specific statute that should prevail over the more general provision in &sect; 204C.40, subd. 2. There was no conflict between the requirements of subdivisions 1 and 2. The subdivisions simply contained different timing provisions applicable in different electoral circumstances. There was no federal statutory mandate that the state issue a certificate of election by the date designated by Congress for the commencement of newly-elected Senators' terms. Because the Senate had the authority to seat a Senator without a certificate of election, application of the contest tolling provision in &sect; 204C.40, subd. 2, to an election for the U.S. Senate did not usurp the Senate's power and did not conflict with federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant failed field sobriety tests, the arresting officer administered a breath test. Defendant did not blow into the machine hard enough for a breath sample to register, and she did not advise the officer of any medical condition that might have affected her breathing. The officer denied her request to take the test again but allowed her to obtain a urine test from a private company. The court found no violation of defendant's due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because the circumstances of her breath test were not unfair. The record did not show that the officer acted in bad faith, and his behavior did not shock the conscience. The court stated that the court of appeals erred in ruling that defendant was not given a meaningful opportunity to obey the law, which was not the applicable due process standard. The court further held that no unconstitutional condition had been imposed upon defendant's driving privileges; the breath test was not an unconstitutional search under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a minor child's biological father, moved to enforce his rights under a contact agreement he entered into with respondents, the child's adoptive parents, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 259.58 (2006). The district court granted the adoptive parents' motion to modify or terminate the contact agreement, dismissed the father's motion to enforce his rights, and terminated the agreement. The Court of Appeals, Minnesota, affirmed. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court vacated the order approving the contact agreement without holding an evidentiary hearing and, in doing so, violated the father's right to due process guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The father had a protected property interest under the contact agreement in continuing contact and communication with the child. The district court's order summarily deprived him of his rights under the contact agreement and left him with no recourse, except to appeal. The district court did not require the adoptive parents to produce witnesses, such as the father's former girlfriend or employees of the adoptive agency, for cross-examination, but accepted their version of events as fact in the face of the father's denials. An evidentiary hearing, limited to whether the circumstances warranted modification or termination of the contact agreement under &sect; 259.58(3)(c), entailed a relatively limited burden on the State's interest in preserving a contact agreement (once entered into an approved by a court), and did not outweigh the father's interest in preserving his rights under the parties' contact agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court concluded that the district court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing on the adoptive parents' motion to modify or terminate the contact agreement, reversed the order granting the adoptive parents' motion to terminate the contact agreement, reinstated the contact agreement, and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the adoptive parents' motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition on grounds of laches with respect to the primary ballot because, given petitioners' unreasonably delay in asserting its interpretations of the Minnesota constitution and election statutes, and balanced against the significant potential prejudice to respondents, including the inability to meet election deadlines due to the reprinting of ballots and reprogramming of election machines, it would be inequitable to grant the relief sought by petitioners. The court further denied the petition with respect to the general election ballot because Minn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 8 did not bar the associate justice from seeking election to the judicial office to which she was appointed, as the legislative history indicated that, at least for the past 59 years, the legislature had understood that the current office holder could be a &quot;candidate to succeed himself&quot; whether initially appointed to the position or elected. The court further held that the justice could be designated as the &quot;incumbent&quot; on the ballot, as such designation did not violate Minnesota's election laws or the candidate's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tribe agreed to provide employment services to tribal members in the tribe's service area, which included the member's residence, under the state's economic benefit program for low-income families. Minn. Stat. &sect; 256J.645 required that the county from which the member received benefits refer the member to the tribe for employment services, but the member argued that the statute did not preclude the member from receiving county employment services, and that the member was denied equal protection. The Supreme Court of Minnesota held, however, that the statutory requirement that the member be referred to the tribe for employment services also contemplated that the member receive such services through the tribe, and the member was not granted any right to select the source of the services. Further, the requirement did not burden the member's fundamental right to interstate travel and classified the member based on membership in the tribe rather than race, and thus only rational-basis review applied. Moreover, the statutory distinction was rationally based on the legislative goals of providing culturally appropriate services to tribal members and promoting tribal self-government.</SPAN></P>

It appeared defendant had provided his DNA sample for the database pursuant to &sect; 609.117 after having been convicted of burglary. The court held that, under a totality-of-the-circumstances test, the warrantless, suspicionless collection of defendant's DNA pursuant to  &sect; 609.117 did not violate the Fourth Amendment or Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court held that the State's substantial interests in exonerating the innocent, deterring recidivism, identifying offenders of past and future crimes, and bringing closure for victims of unsolved crimes outweighed the minimal intrusion. The court also held that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of defendant's prior burglary conviction because of the marked similarity between the facts underlying the burglary and the facts underlying the murder.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the district court erred in ruling that the Minnesota Rules of Evidence did not apply in jury sentencing trials, but that the error was harmless for the same reason that the constitutional errors were harmless. The court held that defendant's due process rights were not violated when the district court declined to give the sentencing jury an accomplice corroboration instruction under Minn.

The victim's nude body was partially covered by a comforter, which had been pinned to her chest with a knife. The police conducted an extensive investigation, but found almost no physical evidence in the home. An autopsy revealed that the victim had been beaten, sexually assaulted anally and vaginally, strangled, and slowly stabbed numerous times in the chest. In 2000, a citizen informant came forward with information connecting defendant to the murder. Subsequently, a search warrant was obtained for a sample of defendant's DNA. Testing of that sample revealed that defendant's DNA matched that of the semen found on the victim's body. Defendant claimed that he had known the victim, and that they had engaged in a brief extramarital affair. The court ruled that defendant failed to establish plain error under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and that the State had carried its burden of proof to show that the prosecutor's misconduct did not prejudice defendant's substantial rights.

He moved to suppress, and the district court granted the motion, finding that the impoundment was unjustified. The State appealed, and the appellate court reversed.

Defendant was not placed under arrest, and he asked if someone else could come to get the vehicle or if he could have it towed. While the police could have impounded the car if its presence constituted a safety hazard, the district court specifically found that leaving defendant's vehicle on the side of a county road in the middle of the day would not have created a safety hazard.

A district court sentenced defendant to an executed term of 210 months, a double durational upward departure from the high end of the range for the presumptive sentence under the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines. The Court of Appeals, Minnesota, affirmed. The instant court granted review of the sentencing issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the sentencing departure was improperly based on uncharged offenses of third-degree assault and burglary. The departure from the presumptive guidelines sentence was based on the nature of the victim's injuries and commission of the crime in the victim's zone of privacy, his home. Regarding the nature of the injuries, the State presented expert evidence that the orbital fracture amounted to substantial bodily harm. The infliction of substantial bodily harm was third-degree assault. With regard to the zone of privacy, the nonconsensual entry into a dwelling with intent to commit a crime when a person was present was first-degree burglary. The court found that a departure could not have been based on uncharged criminal conduct. The guidelines did not contemplate enhanced sentences based on uncharged criminal conduct that would have been far greater than what would have otherwise been permitted based on charged criminal conduct. Therefore, defendant's enhanced sentence was based upon impermissible departure factors.</SPAN></P>

The district court found that the State failed to present evidence of exigent circumstances or that an emergency existed justifying a warrantless blood draw.

Stat. &sect; 609.21 (2006), and (2) the rapid, natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood created single-factor exigent circumstances that justified the police taking a warrantless, nonconsensual blood draw from respondent. Also, the possibility of obtaining a telephonic warrant was insufficient to overcome the single-factor exigent circumstances of the rapid dissipation of alcohol in respondent's blood.</SPAN></P>

The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed. The county and guardian ad litem sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relying on the definition of &quot;malicious prosecution of a child&quot; under Minn.

Stat. &sect; 260C.007, subd. 5 (2006), the appeals court held that &quot;physical abuse&quot; under &sect; 260C.007, subd. 6(2), required unreasonable force or cruel discipline that was excessive under the circumstances. The Supreme Court of Minnesota disagreed, holding that physical abuse that caused only mental injury could qualify as physical abuse for the definition of a child in need of protection or services under &sect; 260C.007, subd. 6(2)(i). However, in the case at bar, the stipulated record did not provide sufficient information on which to conclude that either mental or physical injury had been proven. Although the child wielded a knife in conjunction with a suicide threat, raising serious concerns, the bare-bones record did not support a conclusion that the injury resulted in an impairment in the child's ability to function within a normal range of performance and behavior. Remand to allow supplementation of the record was not in the interests of justice, in part because almost three years had passed without further incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the court of appeals as to its reversal of the CHIPS adjudication but reversed the court of appeals as to its definition of physical abuse.</SPAN></P>

The court observed that the homestead exemption statute was enacted pursuant to Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, which provided that a reasonable amount of property was to be exempt from seizure or sale for the payment of any debt or liability. The court held that this constitutional provision precluded the forfeitures of homestead properties under the forfeiture statute because: (1) the breadth of the term &quot;liability,&quot; coupled with the rule that homestead exemptions were to be construed liberally, suggested that the constitutional language was broad enough to encompass forfeitures; and (2) several other state supreme courts had held that state forfeiture laws violated statutory or constitutional homestead exemptions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of misdemeanor criminal damage to property in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.595 and felony theft from a person with a superior right of possession in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.52, subd. 2(2) (2004) and was ordered to pay restitution of $ 1,509. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota affirmed defendant's convictions but reversed the restitution order. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for vandalizing his employer's truck and removing a custom seat. On appeal, the court held that the district court did not have jurisdiction over the criminal damage to property charge under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.595 because the crime was complete when defendant damaged the truck while it was parked at his home in Wisconsin; the employer's economic loss in Minnesota was neither part of the crime nor related to an element thereof. The district court had jurisdiction over the theft from a person with superior right of possession charge because the triggering event was defendant's going to his employer's headquarters in Minnesota to pick up his check and it was not there for him; defendant's intent to permanently deprive the employer of the custom seat was formed at least in part in Minnesota. When defendant's employment ended on that date so did his right to continue to use his employer's truck and the custom seat. The district court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal under Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.03, subd. 17(1) because the evidence was sufficient to support his theft conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of criminal damage to property was reversed for lack of jurisdiction, but his conviction of theft was affirmed. The case was remanded to the district court to consider the fact that the custom seat was returned to the employer and the monetary payments defendant had made before the theft to determine whether the employer had in fact suffered any economic loss from the theft.</SPAN></P>

The inmate sued the commissioner, seeking injunctive relief with regard to her eligibility for parole. The district court dismissed the complaint, finding that the commissioner was entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was serving an indeterminate life sentence based on a 1989 conviction for first-degree felony murder. Under the law in effect when she was convicted, the inmate was eligible for parole after serving 17 years of her sentence. However, in March of 2003, the commissioner continued review of the inmate's file until 2010. She stated in a letter to the inmate that no life-sentenced inmate was released at his or her minimum parole eligibility date. The inmate filed suit, alleging that the decision violated her due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Reversing the dismissal, the court found that although the commissioner would have been immune from a suit for damages, she was not entitled to quasi-judicial immunity from a suit seeking an injunction. Although Congress, by the enactment of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, restricted the availability of injunctive relief against judicial offers under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, no such restriction was imposed with regard to quasi-judicial officers and there was no reason to expand the statute beyond the limited reach Congress gave it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because neither the criminal test-refusal statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2 (2004), nor the civil implied-consent law, Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.51, subd. 1(a) (2004), conditioned the driving privilege on surrendering the Fourth Amendment right to withhold consent from a warrantless search, Minn.

Under the circumstances of this case, when defendant was deemed to refuse to submit to a chemical test based on providing an inadequate breath sample and defendant sought both additional time to provide an adequate sample and an alternate mode of chemical testing, the failure to provide an alternate method of chemical testing rendered her conviction for refusal to submit to a chemical test a violation of the fundamental fairness guarantees of due process.</SPAN></P>

Const. art.

The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because the inconsistencies in the victim's testimony were relatively minor, especially in light of the traumatic nature of the rape and her other consistent testimony. The victim's reports to the sexual-assault nurse and the officer at the time of the assault corresponded to the victim's testimony at trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct by a member of the clergy, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.344, subd. 1(l)(ii) (2006). The Minnesota Court of appeals rejected claims that the statute was void for vagueness or violated the Establishment Clause, and that the statute did not foster excessive governmental entanglement with religion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant served as a Catholic priest, and began sexual relationships with two adult female parishioners. Defendant argued that the clergy sexual conduct statute was unconstitutional because it was void for vagueness and it violated the Establishment Clause of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. The reviewing court held that the clergy sexual conduct standard was not unduly vague and did not violate due process. Because the terms &quot;ongoing&quot; and &quot;religious or spiritual advice, aid, or comfort&quot; had acquired reasonably definite meanings, those terms provided a sufficiently fixed legal standard to determine what was prohibited. Also, the reviewing court was equally divided on the issue of whether the clergy sexual conduct statute facially violated the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. Furthermore, the district court allowed the religious doctrine of the Catholic Church to become entangled with the criteria set out in the clergy sexual conduct statute for determining the criminality of defendant's conduct. The jury's verdict was based on this evidence and was unavoidably entangled with the religious doctrine introduced into evidence by the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to the finding that the statute was not unduly vague, the instant court was divided on whether the statute facially violated the Establishment Clause and affirmed as to the finding that the statute did not facially violate the Establishment Clause, and defendant's convictions were reversed and remand to the district court for a new trial that did not entangle the court and religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a pretrial order suppressing evidence of defendant's intoxication in a boating-while-intoxicated prosecution. The district court held that a deputy who stopped defendant's boat for a moving violation did not have probable cause or reason to suspect any other offense until after the deputy initiated an unconstitutional safety-equipment inspection of the boat. Minn. R. 6110.1200, subps. 3(A), (5) (2005) required all watercraft to carry an immediately available Type IV personal flotation device. Because defendant did not have a Type IV device in plain sight of the deputy who stopped his small, open boat, the deputy had probable cause to believe that defendant was violating the law and was permitted, therefore, to ask defendant to show him the device. While inquiring about the flotation device the deputy developed reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant was intoxicated. After conducting field sobriety tests, the deputy had probable cause to arrest defendant. Thus, the appellate court reversed the district court's suppression of evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county had authority to consider the CUP application under the zoning ordinance existing at the time of the application instead of an amended version as the language in Becker County, Minn., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 3, subd. 2 (2004) did not limit the county's discretion. Moreover, the county had discretion, in an adjudicatory proceeding, to consider a pending CUP application under the ordinance in effect when the application was filed. Nothing in the vested-rights doctrine limited the county's discretion in determining which ordinance to apply. The right of estoppel was inapplicable where the county had applied the earlier ordinance and granted the CUP. Thus, the owners did not need to defend their interests against government action. The county did not abuse its discretion in granting the CUP where it had carefully considered which ordinance version to apply and nothing in the record indicated that the county policy of applying the ordinance in effect at the time of the application was applied inconsistently. However, the county erred in granting the CUP as the final CUP did not contain a site plan as required under Becker County. Minn., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 7, subd. 3 (2002).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.63 (2006) was not ambiguous. By its plain language, the statute did not require that a driver be convicted of a designated offense for the vehicle used to be subject to forfeiture. Commission of a designated offense was sufficient, and here it was undisputed that appellant committed a designated offense. His vehicle was, therefore, subject to forfeiture under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.63 (2006). Appellant also argued that the forfeiture statute encouraged arbitrary enforcement and, as a result, was void for vagueness. However, because appellant did not raise the constitutional challenge to the statute in the district court, he could not raise it for the first time on appeal. Further, even if the court were to evaluate appellant's constitutional argument on the merits, it would reject it because appellant provided no authority to support his contention that inconsistent application by district courts rendered a statute unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee obtained a temporary work assignment through the employer performing packaging work for a company. Three months later, the employer told the employer that he would be ending his work assignment because he planned to leave the country. The employee subsequently sought and was denied unemployment benefits. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the record supported the ULJ's finding that the employee was engaged in an ongoing assignment at the company and his decision to end the assignment constituted a quit under Minn. Stat. &sect; 268.095, subd. 2(a) (2004). The employee consistently worked from the beginning of his assignment until he quit, he was paid on alternating weeks rather than daily, and he gave advance notice that he would be ending his employment. The statutory exception of &sect; 268.095, subd. 1(5) did not apply because his position with the company was full-time, as the employer's unemployment insurance administrator testified that the employee worked an average of more than 36 hours each week at the company and that only during two weeks did he work fewer than 32 hours.

The nature of the requested evidence fell within the scope referenced in Minn. R. Juv. Delinq. P. 18.03, subd. 1. The compelled nature of the evidence also brought the records under the purview of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.09, subd. 2. The Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination applied to the juvenile certification procedure, but the presumptive-certification statute did not violate this right, either facially or as applied, by providing an opportunity for the juvenile to rebut a presumption of adult certification. The district court compelled the appellant to provide the evidence; therefore, the information provided was immune from use in appellant's criminal proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents challenged an order from the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) adjudicating their children in need of protection or services (CHIPS). Appellants argued that the district court erred by concluding that their use of corporal punishment was &quot;physical abuse,&quot; and created an injurious or dangerous environment under Minn. Stat. &sect; 260C.007, subds. 6(2), (9) (2006), respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the state's argument that physical abuse was the equivalent of bodily harm and, therefore, only required physical pain. Minn. Stat. &sect; 260C.007, subd. 6(2)(i), clearly required physical abuse and physical abuse required unreasonable force or cruel discipline that was excessive under the circumstances. The incident involved paddling a 13 year old boy who weighed 195 pounds, using a small maple paddle, and spanking him on the upper thighs 36 times (3 sets of 12 swats). The boy ran off after the paddling. The third set, administered after the boy threatened suicide, was troublesome. Spanking a child for wielding a knife and making a suicide threat was probably not an appropriate parental response. But the court could not conclude that the third set of swats constituted physical abuse under Minn. Stat. &sect; 260C.007, subd. 6(2). The force used was not unreasonable nor constituted cruel discipline that was excessive. There was no evidence to support a finding of emotional maltreatment. The district court relied on its finding of corporal punishment to support its dangerous environment finding, but the court found no basis for such a finding.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded that he forfeiture statute could not be applied to a homestead because allowing homestead property to be forfeited based on the criminal acts of the homestead owner imposed a liability on the owners, and therefore forfeiture of the homestead was a seizure for the payment of a liability, which was prohibited by Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother, a member of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe (MCT) who received Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP) benefits, challenged a sanction imposed by respondent County Health and Human Services when she failed to comply with certain employment requirements. Respondent Minnesota Department of Human Services Commissioner upheld the sanction, and the Aitkin County District Court, Minnesota, affirmed. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the mother contended Minn. Stat. &sect; 256J.645 (2006) violated equal protection protections, asserting that non-Indians and members of other tribes were able to receive employment services through a county agency, while she was ineligible to receive these services. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that because the channeling of the mother's right of access to her tribal service occurred as part of the MCT's contractual arrangement with the Commissioner for the benefit of MCT members (wherein the MCT agreed to provide MFIP employment services for specific public assistance recipients who were of Indian descent), it was political rather than racial in nature. While there was no dispute that identified members of the MCT were treated differently under Minn. Stat. &sect; 256J.645, subd. 4 (2006), because the classifications under the statute were political rather than racial, a rational basis standard of review was applicable. The statute passed constitutional muster by supporting the legitimate state interest of protecting and promoting tribal sovereignty. Thus, &sect; 256J.645, subd. 4 did not violate the equal protection clause of the federal or state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Minnesota Legislature ended a legislative session without appropriating the money necessary to fund significant executive-branch functions. The district court issued an order authorizing the Commissioner to continue to fund core government functions. The Commissioner disbursed state funds. The legislature passed appropriation bills and stated that the appropriations were effective retroactively and superseded and replaced funding authorized by the court order. The appellate court determined that the doctrine of laches did not preclude relief for the legislators' request for a writ of quo warranto based on their failure to object during the temporary-funding proceedings. The appellate court found that quo warranto was not an appropriate action for legislators to challenge the Commissioner's disbursement, because the official conduct was not ongoing. Under Minn. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 and art. XI, &sect; 1, the case was nonjusticiable because of the legislature's constitutionally significant decision to retroactively appropriate public funds that effectively and expressly superseded the Commissioner's temporary actions of distributing funds under a court order without an appropriation.</SPAN></P>

Appellant asserted that the entire statutory scheme was unconstitutional under Blakely because presumptive certification motions allowed first the prosecutor and then the judge, rather than a jury, to determine what sentencing options would be available. Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11 controlled because the presumptive duration of the sentence was the mandatory minimum sentence according to statute or the duration of the prison sentence provided in the appropriate cell of the Sentencing Guidelines Grid, whichever was longer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.108, governing patterned and predatory sex offenders, was unconstitutional under Blakely because it allowed for the district court, and not a jury, to find the existence of sentencing enhancements. The court of appeals disagreed. The district court used a number of aggravating factors that defendant conceded were true to justify an upward departure; only one of which was his admission to being a patterned sex-offender. Defendant admitted that his actions were &quot;motivated by sexual impulses and were part of a pattern of predatory behavior with criminal sexual conduct as its goal.&quot; He also conceded that he committed the crime with particular cruelty because it was within the victim's zone of privacy and her child was present. There was no issue of whether those findings should have been made by a sentencing jury, as defendant specifically waived a jury during his guilty plea, and the district court did not rely on any information outside of defendant's prior convictions, the information provided in his plea, and his admissions during the plea hearing to justify the departure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found that prosecuting the sale of cocaine as a third-degree crime under Minn.

Stat. &sect; 152.024, subd. 1(1) (2004). The district court could not discern any rational basis for punishing the sale of cocaine as a narcotic drug more severely than the sale of cocaine as a schedule II controlled substance. The appellate court determined that the district court erred by finding the third-degree controlled-substance-crime statute unconstitutional as applied because (1) the clear legislative intent of the multi-tiered controlled-substance-crime statutory scheme was to proscribe the sale of a mixture containing less than three grams of cocaine as a third-degree controlled-substance crime, and not as a fourth-degree controlled-substance crime, and (2) defendant's as-applied equal-protection claim failed because he relied merely on the potential for discriminatory enforcement and did not show that others similarly situated were charged under the statute with a lesser penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court concluded that &sect; 617.247, subd. 8, an affirmative defense provision, shifted the burden of production on the age element to a criminal defendant, and that this shift violated a criminal defendant's right to due process because it also created a de facto shift in the burden of persuasion. However, defendant was not prejudiced by the existence of &sect; 617.247, subd. 8. Defendant asserted the affirmative defense, without presenting any evidence that the persons depicted in the photographic images were 18 years or older. Despite defendant's failure to meet his burden of production, the trial court required the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the photographs depicted minors. A review of the photographic images from the 23 counts for which defendant was convicted showed that each of the alleged pornographic works depicted persons so clearly under the age of 18 that there could be no question that the State met its constitutional burden of persuasion without regard to any obligation placed on defendant by &sect; 617.247, subd. 8.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court denied the State's motion, holding that there was no version of the patterned-sex-offender statute that permitted it to impanel a resentencing jury in that such authority under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1089, subd. 1, applied only to offenses committed on or after August 1, 2005, and defendant committed his offenses in 1996. On review, the court reversed, finding that, even though former Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1352, subd. 1 (1996), allowed only judicial fact-finding, the district court was entitled to exercise its inherent judicial authority to effectuate the legislature's intent to enhance the sentences of patterned sex offenders in a constitutional manner under the Sixth Amendment by impaneling a jury. The legislature had remained silent regarding how a district court might fulfill the statutory mandate of the patterned sex offender laws in a constitutional manner because it had not provided guidance for offenses prior to the effective date of the new provision. Absent such guidance, impaneling a resentencing jury to effectuate the legislature's intent fell within the judiciary's unique functions while safeguarding defendant's Sixth Amendment rights under Blakely.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction for a controlled-substance offense, arguing that the drugs he discarded when police attempted to execute a bench warrant for his arrest should have been suppressed because the warrant was invalid. He claimed that the warrant, which the Anoka County District Court (Minnesota) issued because defendant failed to appear for trial on a different charge, violated the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's failure to appear was an offense that occurred in the presence of the judge, and the failure constituted probable cause to support the bench warrant. The scheduling of the criminal proceedings, the appearance of defendant's attorney as scheduled, and defendant's absence from the courtroom when the district court called his case for trial obviously supported the district court's determination that the bench warrant rested on probable cause that defendant failed to appear. Also, the court held that the bench warrant that was issued to secure defendant's appearance to stand trial for a charge for which probable cause had already been established did not offend the oath-or-affirmation clause of the Fourth Amendment. Finally, the &quot;body-only&quot; bench warrant was not constitutionally required to include a bail provision. Minn. Const., art. I, &sect; 7 neither expressly stated nor implied that all arrest warrants had to provide for bail. And the rule requiring that an issuing judge must set the amount of bail on the warrant applied only to warrants initially issued upon a complaint. Minn. R. Crim. P. 3.02, subd. 1.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court determined that the statute required a sufficient level of scienter as to the age of the performers to satisfy First Amendment requirements because (1) the &quot;reason to know&quot; language was interpreted to require a possessor to be &quot;in some manner aware&quot; that the performer was a child, (2) the &quot;in some manner aware&quot; standard was sufficient to support a conviction for possession of child pornography since the possession of child pornography did not require any greater protection than the distribution of obscene materials, and (3) the State's substantial interest in preventing the sexual exploitation of minors amply justified the &quot;in some manner aware&quot; standard.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the OAH did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding that the statements violated the statute because (1) the First Amendment did not provide absolute protection to political speech, (2) the three statements were actionable assertions of fact rather than protected statements of opinion, and (3) the candidate knew that the statements were false or made the statements with reckless disregard of whether or not they were false since the board records contradicted the statements in the flyer. Also, the penalty under Minn. Stat. &sect; 211B.32, subd. 1 (2004) was valid because the factors used were consistent with those mandated in Minn. Stat. &sect; 14.045, subd. 3(a) (2004), and the use of a penalty matrix by the OAH did not constitute unpromulgated rulemaking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based upon a surveillance videotape, the workers' compensation judge asserted that &sect; 176.101, subd. 1(i), precluded the employee from receiving TTD compensation because she refused a suitable work offer. The WCCA concluded that the statutory disqualification under &sect; 176.101 for refusing a work offer did not apply to situations in which the work offer predated the period of total disability and that there was no overt or constructive refusal of a work offer. On review, the court affirmed the decision of the WCCA, agreeing that the workers' compensation judge erred in terminating benefits. Payment of benefits was not grounded on contract law; liability on the part of an employer or insurer for TTD was considered as a continuing product and part of the employee's inability to earn or reduction in earning capacity due to injury, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.021. The court found that the WCCA's conclusion that discontinuance of TTD benefits was conditioned on an actual offer of suitable work during the payment of benefits properly addressed basic fairness concerns.

It was clear from a reading of the entire statute that it applied only to those individuals who exercised official authority to regulate companies and that it affected their employment only with companies &quot;subject to rate regulation&quot; by the Commission. Minn. Stat. &sect; 216A.036 unambiguously stated that a commissioner's employment with a rate-regulated company was restricted. Also, the unambiguous statutory language supported the Commission's decision that relator's employment violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 216A.036. Further, the $ 2,500 fine was neither severe nor drastic. The fine was on the lower end of permissible sanctions, and the record did not establish that it impacted relator drastically.

The supreme court disagreed. The nature of the injuries to the attempted murder victims supported the jury's finding of premeditation. Both children sustained life-threatening injuries. One was hit by three separate gunshots. After shooting one victim, defendant walked down the hallway to the back bedroom, away from the front door of the apartment, to shoot the children. Defendant's behavior after the shootings revealed a cool, calm demeanor consistent with premeditation. One witness testified that defendant took the time to pull his jacket hood over his head, presumably to conceal his identity, before leaving her apartment. Defendant paused to lock the door to the apartment after the shootings. The autopsy on the murder victim showed that he likely turned away from his attacker after the first shot and was then shot in the back. The evidence relating to the murder was consistent with an inference of premeditation and was inconsistent with any other rational explanation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner brought a declaratory judgment action against respondent watershed district, challenging the district's authority to require him to clean and maintain a public right-of-way ditch on his property. The Clay County District Court (Minnesota) granted the district summary judgment, dismissing the landowner's claims for injunctive relief and affirming the district's order. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district lacked authority under Minn. Stat. ch. 103D to order a landowner to clean a private ditch subject to the watershed district's public right-of-way easement because nothing in the chapter expressly or implicitly authorized the district to order a private landowner to clean and maintain his ditch for the benefit of the district. However, the district had the authority to determine whether a blockage of its easement constituted an obstruction within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect; 103E.075 (2004), and thus require the landowner to remove the obstruction, where the district was a drainage authority, the statute explicitly authorized the district to order removal of obstructions, and the district was authorized to make repairs under the statute. Because neither the watershed district nor the district court concluded whether the siltation was an &quot;obstruction&quot; within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect; 103E.075, a remand was required for further proceedings. The district court was permitted to reopen the record to conduct evidentiary hearings.</SPAN></P>

The owners counterclaimed, alleging that the ordinance violated the First Amendment. On appeal, the court held that the owners were not eligible to receive lawful nonconforming use rights under the 2003 ordinance because the owners attempted to open their business just days before the enactment of a regulation change at a location that had not previously been in conformance with septic regulations. The court further held that the ordinance did not violate the First Amendment because the owners failed to raise direct doubt regarding the studies the county relied on when making its determinations regarding the adverse secondary effects of AUBs and because there was commercial land in the county fit for use by AUBs under the 2003 AUB ordinance.

The appellate court found that, by directing that biological specimens be taken from individuals who had been charged with certain offenses solely because there had been a judicial determination of probable cause to support a criminal charge, Minn. Stat. &sect; 299C.105, subd. 1(a)(1) and (3), dispensed with the requirement under the Fourth Amendment that before conducting a search, law-enforcement personnel had to obtain a search warrant. Under the statute, it was not necessary for anyone to even consider whether the biological specimen to be taken was related in any way to the charged crime or to any other criminal activity. The privacy interest of a person who had been charged but had not been convicted was not outweighed by the State's interest in collecting and analyzing a DNA sample.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that admission of the BCA lab report, without the testimony of the lab analyst, violated his confrontation rights. The court held that the BCA report was testimonial and that its admission under Minn.

Also the admission of the report under Minn. Stat. &sect; 634.15 violated defendant's confrontation rights because &sect; 634.15 made lab reports admissible without the testimony of the preparer unless, at least 10 days before trial, the defendant requested that the preparer be called to testify, but &sect; 634.15 did not inform the defendant that his failure to request the testimony of a crime lab analyst would result in the waiver of his confrontation rights.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the supreme court reversed the appellate court's decision.

The Minnesota Racing Commission designated an Exclusion Appeal Panel to hear the patron's appeal. The Panel recommended upholding the patron's permanent exclusion, and the Commission affirmed. The patron appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the patron challenged the Commission's decision arguing, inter alia, that his exclusion from the racetrack violated his constitutional and statutory right to due process. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that because the racetrack was a privately owned corporation, it was not ordinarily subject to the restrictions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The primary motivation to exclude the patron was not a state interest, but was instead the racetrack's economic and private interest in maintaining a safe business environment and in preventing sexual harassment. Thus, the racetrack's exercise of its authorized choice to exclude the patron under Minn. Stat. &sect; 240.27, subd. 5 (2004) did not equate to state action for Fourteenth Amendment purposes. Contrary to the patron's assertions, &sect; 240.27, subd. 5 did not require the racetrack to provide the patron with a hearing, and his vagueness challenge to the statute did not apply. Further, the patron admitted that his behavior was improper, and he was repeatedly warned not to touch female employees and not to make remarks that were sexual or lewd; a reasonable person in his position would have known that his conduct was at risk.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received a citation for allegedly violating Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.444, subd. 6 (2004). The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, denied the motion, held a bench trial, and found defendant guilty of the petty misdemeanor of being the owner of a violating vehicle. Defendant challenged his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school bus driver alleged that he had activated his flashing light and extended a stop-signal arm when he saw an approaching car. The car did not stop. The bus driver identified the license plate and the type of car. On appeal, defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated due process by creating an irrebuttable presumption or an irrational rebuttable presumption that the owner of the car was the driver or by criminalizing car ownership generally. He also argued that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated during the evidentiary hearing. In Minnesota, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.02, subd. 1 (2004) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.02, subd. 4a (2004), a statutory violation for which no penalty of incarceration was permissible was not classified as a crime. Section 169.444 was meant to protect school children from being struck by motor vehicles when the children were on or near streets and highways. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that the statute criminalized mere car ownership. The evidence was sufficient to show both a violation of the school-bus-safety law and the identity of the registered owner of the violating vehicle.</SPAN></P>

Defendants' relied upon a Minnesota Supreme Court case to support their contention that the implied-consent law, which was rendered unconstitutional because of due-process violations, should have the effect of suppressing chemical-test results in criminal DWI proceedings. The appellate court ruled that because the portion of the implied-consent law that was declared unconstitutional in the cited case regarding judicial review for a license revocation did not have any affect on the evidence obtained for a related criminal DWI proceeding, the district court did not err in denying defendants' motions to suppress the results of their chemical tests. Defendants had not shown that they were coerced into submitting to the chemical tests and had not shown how their due-process rights have been violated. Also, the advisory did not mislead defendants into involuntarily consenting to taking a chemical test. The constitutional violation identified in the cited case related only to review proceedings that would occur only long after the advisory was given and the driver had made his decision.</SPAN></P>

In examining the expert witnesses, defense counsel demonstrated familiarity with petitioner's medical history and a competent understanding of the techniques used by psychiatrists to diagnose patients. In addition, because defense counsel's strategy was to attempt to fit the petitioner's conduct within the parameters of the mental illness defense statute, counsel's failure to challenge the statute's constitutionality was reasonable.

Stat. &sect; 609.344, subd. 1(e) was neither so broad that an ordinary person could not understand what conduct it proscribed nor so narrow that it could not include a police officer, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant met the complainant through his employment as a police officer assigned to perform community policing. Defendant developed his relationship with the complainant by letting her ride in his squad car. Defendant was on duty and in uniform during both incidents of sexual intercourse. The first incident took place in a conference room at the police station. Although the complainant testified that she acted voluntarily in her relationship with defendant, consent was not a defense to third-degree criminal sexual conduct. The jury could reasonably have concluded that defendant was in a position of authority over the complainant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed the district court's holding that respondent general contractor's contribution and indemnity claims against appellants, subcontractors and a supplier, that had not otherwise accrued within 10 years of completion of construction were deemed to have accrued in the tenth year, triggering the extension feature of Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 2. Appellants petitioned for further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court determined that the reference to &quot;accrues&quot; in the repose provision of Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051 had to be read together with the definition that was later given in Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(b) (2002). It did not permit such accrual to be deemed by law to have occurred at some time prior to payment. The legislative purpose was to prevent accrual of a cause of action after a specified period of time from the completion of construction. Had the legislature wanted to declare a separate and different repose period for contribution and indemnity claims, it could have done so explicitly. The repose provision of Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(a) barred a contribution and indemnity claim that had not accrued and had not been brought within the 10 years from the completion of the construction. The repose provision was based on a legitimate legislative objective and did not violate Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8. The prejudice of the district court's plain reading of the statute was prejudicial to the contractor, but that prejudice was the natural consequence of the statute of repose that the legislature chose to enact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, denied appellant school district's motion for summary judgment based on its claim of immunity from tort liability under Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.12, subd. 3a (2002). Respondent parents had sued the school district to recover damages for their children's personal injuries. The district appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district argued that Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.12, subd. 3a violated the equal protection clauses of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. The appellate court noted that the effect of the statute was to allow any Minnesota school district to apply for and receive immunity from tort liability. The statute made a distinction between those school districts that could and those that could not obtain liability insurance at a rate of $1.50 or less per pupil per year. Those that could not obtain that rate and that received a certification of such inability from the commissioner of commerce were immune from tort liability. The $1.50 classification resulted in all public school districts, and all of their potential student tort victims, being treated alike rather than differently. Because the $ 1.50 classification did not result in the unequal treatment of any individual or group, Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.12, subd. 3a, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of either the United States or Minnesota Constitution. It was the responsibility of the legislature and not the judiciary to amend the statute as it saw fit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was charged with two alternative counts of third-degree DWI. The Minnesota Commissioner of Public Safety revoked his driver's license. Following an implied consent hearing, the trial court rescinded the Commissioner's order revoking respondent's driver's license, stating that the deputies had no particularized and objective basis for pursuing and stopping him in his boat. The trial court, adopting another district court's finding and declaration that &sect; 169A.53, subd. 3(g) was unconstitutional, dismissed the charges against respondent. The trial court ruled that &sect; 169A.53, subd. 3(g) was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine. On appeal, the court was satisfied that the legislature was entitled to enact a statute regulating the application of collateral estoppel without violating the separation of powers doctrine. The doctrine of collateral was substantive law. Further, as a matter of comity, &sect; 169A.53, subd. 3(g) should have been allowed to stand.

Const. art. VI, &sect; 10 and applicable statutes. The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) denied the inmate's petition. The inmate sought review.</SPAN></P>

The judge assigned to preside over the inmate's criminal case had served as a judge for several years. The disputed judge had resigned his position, but he was later appointed to hear this particular matter. On appeal, the court affirmed. Contrary to the State's contention, the inmate's petition was neither time-barred not moot. Contrary to the inmate's contention, the district court did not err by concluding that the disputed judge was a &quot;retired judge&quot; eligible for assignment by the chief justice to act as a judge of the district court. In particular, the court found that the disputed judge was a &quot;retired judge&quot; because he had terminated his active service and qualified for a retirement annuity as a district court judge after more than five years of service. Thus, the court concluded that the disputed judge was eligible for appointment by the chief justice, that his appointment did not violate the state constitution or any state laws, and that the district court properly denied the inmate's petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, before the Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, of burglary in the first degree. Defendant challenged his conviction on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct, and he challenged his sentence on several grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and identified as the person who committed a burglary. The prosecutor suggested that the jury draw negative inferences about the credibility of one of the defense witnesses by noting her interest in the outcome of the litigation, her prior convictions, and the inherent contradiction in her testimony. Even if this conduct rose to the level of prosecutorial misconduct, defendant failed to object and did not sustain sufficient prejudice to require reversal. The prosecutor's use of the term &quot;I believe,&quot; and other statements, were also not prosecutorial misconduct and did not result in undue prejudice. The second issue was whether the district court erred by submitting interrogatories to the jury on the findings required for an upward durational departure under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2 (2000). The district court attempted to avoid obvious constitutional problems, but the supreme court had already considered this remedy, and it concluded: to engraft sentencing-jury or bifurcated-trial requirements onto the Sentencing Guidelines and sentencing statutes would require rewriting them, something severance jurisprudence did not permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An appellate court reversed defendant's sentence, and the matter was remanded for sentencing consistent with the presumptive sentence in the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines to the presumptive sentence without consideration of an aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. The State conceded that it was error for the district court to instruct the jury that the testimony of the victim need not be corroborated. However, the State argued that the error did not prejudice defendant. The State pointed to decisions where a corroboration instruction was given in error, but no prejudice was found because the jury was properly instructed on the burden of proof. However, unlike in that decision, in the instant case, the district court erred by failing to give a curative jury instruction when the prosecutor stated in closing argument that defendant was not to be presumed innocent. Coupled with that error, the district court's instruction that the victim's statement need not be corroborated, and the lack of physical evidence to show that defendant penetrated the victim, created a cumulative effect of errors that denied defendant a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State enacted the Health Impact Fee under Minn. Stat. &sect; 256.9658 (Supp. 2005), which created a fee on every pack of cigarettes sold in Minnesota. This cost was paid by the consumer. The manufacturers and the nonsignatories contended that the fee violated a settlement agreement and was unconstitutional. The district court agreed, and the State sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the imposition of the Health Impact Fee did not violate the settlement agreement because the terms of the agreement did not unmistakably relinquish the State legislature's sovereign authority to impose such an exaction on tobacco products in order to recover health care costs related to the use of such products. The boilerplate waiver language used in the agreement was not sufficient because the language mentioned neither the police nor the taxing power. Further, the manufacturers were released, not their customers or products. Because the fee was imposed on the manufacturers, the nonsignatories did not have a basis for the equal protection claim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant moved to suppress admission of the knife, but the district court denied the motion. Appellant was arrested after she created a disturbance at a school. At issue on appeal was whether the district court erred in denying the motion to suppress. Appellant maintained that swearing at police officers alone did not constitute disorderly conduct. The appellate court determined that the police had probable cause to arrest for a violation of the disorderly conduct statute. The district court found that appellant was disrupting the school by shrieking profanities inside the school administration office. While her language did not constitute fighting words, and it would not support probable cause for content-based disorderly conduct, the objective facts would lead a person of ordinary care to an honest and strong suspicion that appellant was engaging in boisterous and noisy conduct in violation of the statute. The officers had probable cause to arrest appellant for disorderly conduct. The fact that appellant was not charged with trespass and was found not guilty on the disorderly conduct charge did not vary the appellate court's assessment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After police made controlled buys of cocaine from the accused's residence, a search warrant was executed. Drugs and cash were found inside. He eventually pled guilty to a drug charge. The State sought forfeiture of the house and the money under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.5311 (2004) The district court entered judgment for the State, and the accused sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the forfeiture of the house did not violate the excessive fine provisions of U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Minn. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;5. In analyzing such cases, Minnesota courts employed the gross-disproportionality and the nexus tests. The forfeiture of the house was not disproportionately harsh when compared to the severity of the offenses. The value of the house and the money together, $19,530, was comparable to the maximum fines for other similar offenses under Minn. Sentencing Guidelines V (2004). The district court was not required to look at fines actually imposed. Next, the forfeiture was comparable to other jurisdictions as well. Finally, there was a direct and substantial connection between the house and the offense. As such, there was no unconstitutionally excessive fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the domestic abuse murder statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.185(a)(6)&nbsp;(2004), violated the Equal Protection Clause of Minn. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;2 because the elements of the crime overlapped with those of third-degree depraved mind murder, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.195(a) (2004), and domestic abuse murder provided for significantly greater penalties. The appellate court disagreed, finding that because the two statutes did not punish identical conduct, their coexistence did not present an equal protection concern. Furthermore, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a continuance as his counsel's explanation that his expert was not available because she had scheduling difficulties and job concerns were insufficient to constitute good cause. And defendant's counsels' performance did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland as the record showed that the cross-examination of each of the State's medical witnesses was vigorous and detailed, and defendant's counsel secured several concessions favorable to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators, a candidate and an attorney, appealed a decision of the Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings Office (OAH ), which found that they had violated Minn. Sat. &sect;&sect; 211B.04 and .06; ordered relators to each pay civil penalties; and referred the matter to the county attorney's office pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 211B.35, subd. 2 (2004). The action involved statements made about the mayor, a council member and the acting mayor (officials).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor and a city council member expressed interest in purchasing property the city had for sale. After they were advised not to bid, they took no further action. During the candidate's campaign, a letter signed by the attorney, without a disclaimer, was disseminated to all city residents stating that the officials attempted to illegally profit from their elected positions. The court held that the fact that the OHA had authority to determine whether Minn. Stat. &sect; 211B.06 was violated did not mean that the proceeding was a criminal case. Further, while participation in the hearing before the administrative law judge (ALJ) panel was involuntary, the decision was not a &quot;judicial&quot; act because it was subject to review by certiorari in the court. The court also held that the process under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 211B.31 to .37 did not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine. However, the ALJ panel incorrectly analyzed whether relators acted with actual malice. Even if everything the officials did was legal, if relators did not understand the applicable law, they could have believed that there was an attempt to act illegally, and, thus, they would not know the statement was false.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings.</SPAN></P>

His driver's license was revoked, and, on March 21, 2005, he petitioned for judicial review of the revocation. The trial court temporarily reinstated his driver's license pending the Minnesota Supreme Court's release of Fedziuk. Fedziuk was released on May 19, 2005; it held that the 2003 amendment to Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.53, subd. 3(a) was unconstitutional. Fedziuk revived Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.53, subd. 3(a) (2002). The hearing on appellant's license revocation was held on June 23, 2005, more than 60 days after March 21, 2005, when appellant's petition for judicial review was filed. On July 8, 2005, the trial court issued an order sustaining the revocation. On appeal, the court found that the remedy for not providing a hearing within 60 days was not a recission of the revocation but rather a stay of the revocation. Appellant availed himself of that remedy: his revocation was stayed shortly after he filed his petition for judicial review, and the stay remained in effect until the matter was resolved on the merits. Appellant had the stay to which he was entitled; he was not entitled to a rescission.</SPAN></P>

The school district also sought review of the district court's denial of its motion for amended findings. The school district argued, in part, that it did not violate Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union represented teachers employed by the school district. The parties were signatories to a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA), which required the school district to provide group health insurance to the teachers. The union brought suit against the school district, alleging that the school district's unilateral change of health care coverage violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 471.6161, subd. 5, and constituted an unfair labor practice under the Public Employee Labor Relations Act (PELRA). On appeal, the court agreed with the district court decision in favor of the union. The court concluded that the school district unilaterally reduced the &quot;aggregate value of benefits&quot; under the group health-insurance plan in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 471.6161, subd. 5, and PELRA by implementing a change in the health care coverage that resulted in greater out-of-pocket costs to retain one's choice of health care providers. The court also determined that Minn. Stat. &sect; 471.6161, subd. 5, was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Finally, the court held that the school district waived its right to demand arbitration and that the damage award was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police forced the locked door to defendant's house open because they believed that an injured motorist might be inside.

After the district court denied his motion to suppress the evidence, defendant agreed to waive his right to a jury trial and submit the case on stipulated facts. Because the district court found that defendant was in possession of firearms when he committed the offenses, the district court applied the firearm-enhancement statute and imposed the mandatory minimum 36-month sentence. On appeal, defendant argued that the warrant authorizing the search of his house was not supported by probable cause and that the search-warrant application did not contain sufficient information supporting the no-knock and nighttime provisions of the warrant. The appellate court concluded that the information supporting the no-knock and nighttime provisions in the search warrant was illegally obtained.

The petitioner's motion for postconviction relief and appointment of counsel were denied. The district court and court of appeals held that there was no constitutional right to counsel for a postconviction proceeding. The reviewing court held that a criminal defendant in Minnesota had the right to one review of his or her conviction, and Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.05 (as amended in 2003) was unconstitutional. The quality of the petitioner's review as of right of a criminal conviction should not hinge on whether he could pay for the assistance of counsel.

The court determined that the majority of petitioner's claims were barred by the Knaffla rule, including claims that the district court erred in admitting uncorroborated accomplice testimony, claims of racial discrimination in the selection of the grand jury, improper ex parte communication between the judge and a juror, and failure to excuse a juror who was unable to be impartial. Five of petitioner's eight ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims were also Knaffla-barred. As for the three claims that were not barred, the court decided that because it appeared that the grand jury was selected in conformance with established law, petitioner had not established that his trial counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness due to his counsel's failure to challenge the indictment on that basis. The court also rejected both claims that his appellate counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, three cigarette-related entities, sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Minnesota), which upheld the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 297F.24 (2004), Minnesota's Cigarette Fee Act. Appellants challenged the statute as violating U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV, Minn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3 and 8, the state constitution's Uniformity Clause, and prohibitions against bills of attainder in the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State and an insurer sued certain major cigarette manufacturers and trade organizations, asserting claims for monetary, equitable, and injunctive relief. The parties entered a settlement whereby the manufacturers made six one-time payments to the State and continued to make annual payments in perpetuity based, in part, on their annual tobacco sales. None of appellants were defendants in that tobacco litigation and therefore none were not parties to the Minnesota tobacco settlement. The Fee Act later imposed a 35 cents per pack fee on cigarettes distributed in Minnesota. The Act exempted cigarettes covered by the tobacco settlement. On appeal, the court upheld the constitutionality of the Act. It concluded that the Act did not penalize a manufacturer for not having settled with the State and that it did not infringe appellants' First Amendment rights. The court found that the classifications used in the Act (settling versus nonsettling entities) were legitimate and reasonable. Thus, the Act did not violate the Uniformity Clause of the Minnesota Constitution or equal protection guarantees. Finally, the court determined that the Act did not constitute a bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court agreed. The child's interview was initiated by a child-protection worker in response to a report of sexual abuse for the overriding purpose of assessing whether abuse occurred and whether steps were therefore needed to protect the health and welfare of the child. In the interview, the child-protection worker established rapport with the victim, identified the child's terms for human anatomy, made a touch and abuse inquiry, and closed the interview. If part of the purpose of that interview was to produce a statement for use at a future trial, such a purpose was at best incidental to the main purpose: assessing and responding to imminent risks to the child's health and welfare. Neither the child nor the child-protection worker were acting, to a substantial degree, in order to produce a statement for trial, and therefore the child's statements in the assessment interview were not testimonial.</SPAN></P>

In August 2003, defendant admitted violating a disposition condition by trying to buy alcohol. In October 2004, it was found that defendant had failed to remain law abiding. The appellate court affirmed the execution of adult sentences and held that the dual sentencing provision of Minn. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;260B.103, subd. 4(a) (2004) did not violate Minn. Const. art.

The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) granted the State's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Minn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(e) based on the State's immunity under the Minnesota Tort Claims Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736 (2002). The banks appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The banks claimed the State was liable in tort because the securities registration was approved despite the Commerce Department's knowledge that the offering would not meet the registration requirements. The court held that the banks' claims were properly dismissed for failure to state claim under Minn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(e) because the State's registration of the securities for sale in Minnesota was an act of licensing or &quot;other authorization&quot; to which statutory immunity under the Tort Claims Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736, subd. 3(k), applied. The court held that an express representation differed from the representations implied by licensing and noted that Minn. Stat. &sect; 80A.18 specifically indicated that the fact that a security was registered did not constitute a finding by the Department that any document filed under Minn. Stat. ch. 80A was true, complete, and not misleading. The court also held that the State was not subject to suit under the Consumer Fraud Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 325F.69 and that interpreting the Act to authorize a suit against the State for registering debentures was contrary to the Act's purpose, which was to address unequal bargaining power in consumer transactions.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was acquitted of criminal charges. The court held that in the context of the facial challenge, the issue was not moot in that the statute had not been repealed and was alleged to chill protected future expression. However, because &sect; 609.748, subd. 1(a)(1) regulated speech or conduct that constituted &quot;fighting words,&quot; &quot;true threats,&quot; or substantial invasions of one's privacy, it was narrowly tailored and constitutional. Also, the statute did not infringe on constitutionally protected speech and was not overbroad. While the statute was quasi-criminal requiring a heightened definiteness because of potential criminal sanctions, appellant failed to show that an ordinary person would be unable to determine what incidents were subject to the statute. Furthermore, because appellant did not show that there was no probable cause to petition for the restraining order, and she did not appeal the order, she could not now collaterally attack it. The bare allegation that respondent had some greater scheme was insufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact concerning an unlawful end.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police pursuit of the reportedly suicidal driver ended when officers rammed their car into the driver's vehicle resulting in the driver's vehicle killing the pedestrian. The court held that the driver adequately asserted a deprivation of her Fourth Amendment right to be free from the unreasonable use of deadly force because she had committed no crime when they first began following her. Because the officers should have known that the prerequisites for the constitutional use of deadly force had not been met, they were not entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds as to the driver's Fourth Amendment claim. Analyzing under the Lewis intent-to-injure standard, the court found that the spouse had not sufficiently asserted a deprivation of the pedestrian's substantive due process rights as the officers' poor judgment did not automatically convert their acts into conscience-shocking conduct. Because the officers failed to perform the ministerial duty to discontinue their pursuit in accordance with police policy because they knew the driver's identity, the officers were not entitled to common law official immunity for their decision to initiate and continue the pursuit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city council denied the company's proposed comprehensive plan amendment, the company's mandamus action claimed that the &quot;golf course&quot; designation in the comprehensive plan had no direct corresponding zoning classification. The court held that the presence of alternative ways to reconcile the conflict between the comprehensive plan and the zoning ordinance indicated that the city did not have a clear duty to amend the comprehensive plan to conform to the zoning ordinance. The district court exceeded the scope of its authority by interfering with the exercise of legislative discretion and ordering the city to reconcile the conflict by amending the plan. Under the Metropolitan Land Planning Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 473.859, subd. 1 (2004), the comprehensive municipal plan guided land use in cities within the metropolitan area.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father appealed an order by the Olmsted County District Court, Minnesota, denying his motion for a declaration that Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.75 (2004) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.541 (2004) were unconstitutional and that joint physical custody was preferred, and awarding respondent mother sole physical custody of the parties' son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and the father lived together for ten months and separated in May 2003. In September 2003, the mother gave birth to a son, and a paternity test in December 2003 established the father as the biological father. The son lived with his mother all his life. The county brought an action for child support against the father, and the father filed an action for joint legal and physical custody and alleged that Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.75 (2004) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.541 (2004) were unconstitutional and that joint custody should be the preferred custody option. The appellate court held that Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 257.75 and 257.541 did not violate the equal protection clause under either the federal or state constitutions as mothers and fathers were not similarly situated and that granting the mother sole physical custody did not violate the father's equal protection rights. Similarly, Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.541, subd. 2 and subd. 3, did not discriminate on the basis of marital status. Finally, it was not the role of the intermediate court of appeals to overrule the state's position that joint custody was not preferred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Minnesota Court of Appeals entered an order affirming defendant's 144-month sentence for first-degree burglary as a career offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095 (2004). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court departed and imposed a sentence of 144 months under the career offender statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, after finding that defendant had five or more prior felony convictions and that the present offense was committed as part of a pattern of criminal conduct. Defendant appealed the durational departure to the court of appeals, arguing that his prior convictions did not establish a pattern of criminal conduct sufficient to sentence him as a career criminal. The court of appeals affirmed the sentence, holding that the Blakely rule did not apply to upward departures under the career offender statute because the determination of a pattern of criminal conduct was a legal conclusion, not a finding of fact. The supreme court held that recidivism was a narrow exception to the general rule that all facts going to punishment had to be found by a jury; therefore, the determination of a pattern of criminal conduct under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095 (2004) went beyond solely the fact of a prior conviction, and the imposition of an enhanced sentence based on the trial court's finding of a pattern of criminal conduct violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed, and the matter remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
