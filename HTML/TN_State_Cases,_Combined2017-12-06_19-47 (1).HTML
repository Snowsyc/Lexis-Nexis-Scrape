Respondent's petition alleged that she acquired custody of the child from the mother, that the mother surrendered her parental rights to the child in favor of respondent before a judge of the juvenile court. The court affirmed the final decree of adoption in favor of respondent. Inasmuch as the petitioners had neither physical custody of the child nor the right to receive custody, and inasmuch as the mother delivered the child to respondent and executed a surrender in respondent's favor, the court rejected the petitioners' contention that their adoption petition was entitled to the same consideration as the petition filed by respondent. The trial court properly allowed respondent to proceed with her petition, inasmuch as only her petition met the statutory custody requirement. Under the applicable statute, the petitioners had the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed adoption by respondent was not in the child's best interests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the natural mother and her husband filed a petition to adopt the child, the child's natural father passed away. The child's paternal grandmother consequently filed a petition for grandparent visitation, and appellees objected. The trial court held in favor of appellees and denied visitation rights to the paternal grandmother. The trial court determined that the law did not allow grandparents visitation rights when opposed by the natural parents. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court ruled that the privacy interests of natural parents dictated that grandparents could not be awarded visitation in the absence of a finding that the failure to award such visitation would result in substantial harm to the child. The court noted that the paternal grandmother offered no proof to support a finding of substantial harm to the child in the absence of visitation with her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner sought review of a judgment from the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) that upheld his sentences of imprisonment, which were imposed for criminal convictions and enforced by appellee Department of Corrections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of several crimes and sentenced to separate terms of imprisonment. Appellant challenged the sentences, but the trial court upheld the sentences. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Appellee Department of Correction's refusal to revise appellant's sentences to conform to the Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 (Act) did not violate appellant's equal protection rights. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-117(c) clearly stated that the Act was applicable only to persons who were sentenced after the Act's effective date; thus, the Act did not apply to appellant. The distinction between offenders sentenced before and after the Act's effective date had a rational basis because the primary purpose was to relieve prison overcrowding. Appellant did not present evidence that his prison performance credits were incorrectly calculated or that appellee did not honor his recission of the waiver. Appellee remedied any constitutional violations that occurred when appellee extended appellant's parole dates following a disciplinary action against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment that upheld appellant prisoner's sentences of imprisonment was affirmed because appellant was not entitled to revised sentences under the Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989; appellee Department of Corrections rebutted appellant's allegations that appellant was entitled to additional prison performance credits and that appellee did not honor appellant's waiver, and appellant's parole dates were correct.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' action, and the appellate court affirmed the judgment. The trial court did not err in determining that defendant did not abandon child. Defendant testified that, prior to his incarceration, he helped care for child and that he provided monetary support to the best of his ability. Accordingly, there was no clear and convincing showing that defendant consciously disregarded his parental obligations. The court's use of statutory definitions that were subsequently rendered unconstitutional did not prejudice plaintiffs.

The action was dismissed for lack of prosecution when plaintiff failed to report to an appointment for blood testing. Plaintiff then initiated a second action to establish parentage of the child, which the trial court dismissed as barred by res judicata. Plaintiff appealed the decision, arguing that Tennessee's parentage statutes provided an exception to res judicata. The court held that plaintiff was not entitled to an exception under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-2-304(b)(2)(B), because the first petition was dismissed for failure to prosecute the action, not for lack of standing. Plaintiff had standing to pursue the action, because defendant mother consented to the first petition, and agreed to submit blood tests to determine the child's parentage. The court held that the dismissal did not violate public policy. The state legislature specifically limited the circumstances in which res judicata was excepted by the parentage statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff owned a 255-acre tract of land. The tract was completely surrounded by the properties of others. Plaintiff needed to acquire a 50-foot right-of-way to a public road. Plaintiff brought suit against adjoining owners, but not all. Plaintiff applied for an interlocutory appeal, challenging trial court's order to impanel jury of view. The evidence showed that there were potentially feasible rights-of-way across the lands of adjoining landowners not named as party defendants. Thus, the court was of the opinion that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury of view to examine the lands of adjoining property owners to determine the most adequate and convenient location for a right-of-way. The court found that the trial court erred, however, in directing the jury of view to examine the property of non-parties. Upon remand, the trial court was directed to modify its order to require the plaintiff to join as party defendants those adjoining owners of property over which a right-of-way for the benefit of the plaintiff was potentially feasible. The court concluded that the width limitations of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 54-14-101 applied to the facts of the instant case.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff brought civil rights suits against prison official alleging his prison transfer was unconstitutional and defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical condition. Plaintiff then brought the instant suit alleging defendants transferred him in retaliation for his prior suits and prison grievances. Defendants brought a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, claiming immunity from suit. The trial court granted the motion. Plaintiff appealed. The reviewing court affirmed, holding plaintiff's transfer was a discretionary decision for which defendants enjoyed qualified immunity.

The court considered three general preferences established by the legislature and the courts: the preference for family placement, the preference for keeping siblings together, and the preference for continuity of placement. All three preferences relate to the best interest of the child, and none was controlling.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the grandparents of respondent's children, sought to terminate respondent's parental rights and to adopt the children. Finding that such action was proper under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(g)(1) (1999) and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-113(g)(6) (1999), the lower court granted the petition. The court affirmed. Since the proceedings were a status determination, the lower Tennessee court was able to exercise jurisdiction over respondent, a non-resident, notwithstanding the fact that he had no minimum contacts with the state. Jurisdiction was proper because children lived with petitioners in Tennessee for six months prior to proceedings. Although respondent did not abandon children since his wilful act of murdering his wife did not translate to an intent to not visit or support children, clear and convincing evidence existed to support termination on the ground that respondent was incarcerated under a sentence of more than ten years and, at the time of the sentence, his children were under the age of eight, and termination was in best interests of children.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the finding that petitioner father failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that respondent intentionally failed to support the children. The record revealed periodic visitation, letters and telephone conversations between respondent and the children. Respondent had been living in Oklahoma. The judgment that petitioners failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that respondent's failure to visit was willful was affirmed.

One plaintiff had a beer permit and argued that the Act retrospectively deprived it of its vested property right to sell beer while offering adult entertainment. Court responded that beer permit did not constitute a vested property right. Plaintiff was permitted to sell beer. It was unable to sell beer and offer adult-oriented entertainment. In addressing plaintiffs' free speech claims, court initially determined that the Act was a content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation of adult-oriented establishments. Court then analyzed the Act under the O'Brien factors and found that it was constitutional. Finally, court proceeded to consider plaintiffs' claims that the Act was vague and overbroad.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined the order must be deemed simply an award of sole custody to husband. There was no statutory basis for an award of visitation to great-grandmother, and this award of visitation was erroneous as well. In this case, no allegation of substantial harm was made in the pleadings or the testimony at trial. Consequently, the award of visitation to grandmother was erroneous. The court found the circumstances in this case warranted according husband, as the party with custody of the children, the special consideration required under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-4-121(d), and that the trial court erred in ordering the marital home sold along with the parties' other property.</SPAN></P>

The trial court terminated respondent's parental rights and granted the adoption petition. However, the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that, because Tenn. Code.

With respect to appellants' other arguments, the court held that the juvenile court committed reversible error by failing to appoint counsel for appellant father pursuant to Tenn. R. Juv. P. 39. Furthermore, the attorney appointed by the court to represent appellant mother assumed a guardian ad litem role, and such counsel was insufficient for purposes of Tenn. R. Juv. P. 39.

Code Ann. &sect; 45-2-1504(b) provided that lessors recovered a maximum of two months' lease payments after a Tennessee bank failed. Appellant claimed it was unconstitutional to be denied the full amount due on the lease. Appellant failed to meet its burden of proving the statute had no reasonable relationship to a legitimate state interest. The court found a reasonable basis for treating holders of executory leases differently from other contract claimants. Appellant's lease was not entitled to the status of a fundamental interest deeply rooted in this nation's history and tradition so vital that neither liberty nor justice would exist if it were sacrificed. Thus, the statute was not a violation of substantive due process.

Plaintiffs argued that defendant's, county board of commissioners, refusal to rezone plaintiffs property was arbitrary and capricious.

Thus, defendant did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in denying the request to rezone the property to the A-2, Special Agricultural District.

Plaintiffs brought suit for custody of the daughter, child support, and visitation with the son. The lower court granted this relief and awarded plaintiffs attorney's fees. The court reversed the visitation award and remanded this issue holding that before determining whether grandparent visitation was in a child's best interest, the trial court was required to consider whether the lack of grandparent visitation would subject the child to substantial harm. The court modified the child support award by making it retroactive to the date that the daughter began living with plaintiffs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed plaintiff's product liability action against defendant tobacco company, finding that it was barred by the applicable 10-year statute of repose. The court found that fraudulent concealment did not toll the statute of repose applicable to product liability actions. The right which plaintiff claimed was no more than an expectation based upon the anticipated continuation of the common-law discovery rule. Since plaintiff's action was not filed prior to the effective date of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-28-103(a), the viability of the complaint was properly determined under the 10-year statute of repose contained in the Tennessee Products Liability Act of 1978, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-28-101, et seq., as opposed to the common-law discovery rule. The asbestos exception to the products liability statute of repose satisfied rational basis review and did not violate the equal protection guarantees found in either the Tennessee or United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; fraudulent concealment did not toll the statute of repose applicable to product liability actions; the viability of the complaint was properly determined under the 10-year statute of repose contained in the products liability act as opposed to the common-law discovery rule.</SPAN></P>

Defendant answered and counter-sued for breach of contract. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and for an order of reference to an arbitrator. The court found that there was no binding agreement to arbitrate because the parties did not initial and sign the arbitration clause in the contract as required pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-5-302. The parties then orally agreed to arbitration. The arbitrator found that both parties breached the contract and awarded defendants damages. The trial court denied defendants' motion to confirm the award and instead rejected the mediation and placed the matter back on the docket. The appellate court affirmed, holding that there was no binding agreement to arbitrate because there was no written agreement for arbitration.</SPAN></P>

Trial court dismissed plaintiff's suit. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, finding no support for plaintiff's argument that he was suing defendants in their individual rather than official capacity. Thus, his claim for money damages failed. Plaintiff's claims for relief other than money damages fell within the ambit of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-307(h) and were also prohibited, except as to defendant prison officer. A genuine issues of material fact regarding this defendant's actions remained in dispute.
