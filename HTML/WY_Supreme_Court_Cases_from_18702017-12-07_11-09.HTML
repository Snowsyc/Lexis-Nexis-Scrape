Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-2-104 and 6-1-301 (2015), and aggravated assault and battery, under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-502(a)(ii) (2015), was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Federal and Wyoming Constitutions as being multiple punishments for a single offense. HOLDINGS: [1]-Attempted second-degree murder and aggravated assault and battery each contained an element that was not contained in the other as attempted second degree murder required proof of malice, while aggravated assault and battery required use of a deadly weapon. Therefore the cumulative sentences which defendant received upon conviction for the separate offenses did not offend principles of double jeopardy; [2]-Defendant did not show that the statutes were unconstitutionally vague, either on their face or as applied to the facts of his case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-A juvenile court properly dismissed a neglect action against a mother without a hearing or findings about the mother's completion of a consent decree's requirements where nothing in the plain language of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-3-428 required a hearing or findings before a consent decree could expire by its own expiration terms or by discharge, and there was nothing for the juvenile court to find or decide given that the county attorney had decided that the mother had complied with the consent decree satisfactorily and decided not to pursue the neglect case; [2]-Although the consent decree was a contractual agreement, it plainly recognized that the county attorney had the discretion to decide if the original petition should have been pursued; [3]-The other issues raised by the father were moot as any ruling would have no impact on the father, mother, the child, or the State.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-5-210(a) (2015). Furthermore, the search of defendant's jacket, which was left in the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger, was justified by the community caretaker exception to the warrant requirement because defendant appeared to have suffered a seizure after exiting the vehicle and the trooper searched the jacket for medication.</SPAN></P>

VIII because the sentence was not grossly disproportionate to the crime; [2]-Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-306(e) was more severe than similar statutes in some states and less severe than statutes in other states. It could not, therefore, be considered constitutionally unusual under Wyo.

Const. art. 7, &sect; 14; [2]-The phrase &quot;shall be prescribed by law&quot; in Wyo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nieces petitioned to be appointed permanent guardians of appellee uncle. The District Court of Natrona County (Wyoming) originally appointed the nieces as temporary co-guardians and co-conservators. Appellee intervenor, another niece, objected to their appointments. Subsequently, the district court dismissed the guardianship petition after finding the nieces were not qualified to serve as guardians. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court ruled that the nieces were not qualified to serve as guardians because of the conflict of interest created by their potential to inherit from their uncle, which the district court could not waive. The supreme court was unable to agree with the nieces that their potential to inherit from their uncle was a mere expectancy that could not be considered an interest sufficient to disqualify them from a guardianship appointment. Although the uncle could change his will, or other events could occur or not occur, that might affect the nieces' potential to inherit, their undisputed potential to inherit, whether that interest was a present interest or an expectancy, was an interest that might conflict with their uncle's interest as ward. Under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-2-107(a) and (b) (2011), the interest need not be shown to be of a particular magnitude or immediacy to be a disqualifying interest and it would have been error for the district court to make the requested distinction between a present interest and an expectancy. Thus, the district court did not err in finding that the nieces had a conflict of interest that disqualified them from serving as their uncle's guardians.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the District Court of Campbell County (Wyoming), which convicted him of felony stalking, in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-506 (2009).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony stalking of his former wife. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err under Wyo. R. Crim. P. 3(e) in allowing the State to amend the felony information to include incidents of harassment occurring prior to the entry of a December 2009 protection order. Defendant's separate violations of the protection orders issued in the case, as well as his violation of the conditions of his probation, nonetheless constituted acts of harassment relevant in establishing a course of conduct occurring in violation of the December 2009 protective order. Further, defendant was adequately advised of the charges against him.  However, a jury instruction improperly incorporated the intent element of stalking into the examples of harassment demonstrating a course of conduct. The jury instruction wrongly stated that intent was established when a course of conduct included the enumerated examples of harassment. It effectively created the potential for the jury to find him guilty of stalking without independently finding that he intended to harass the victim. The instruction likely confused or misled the jury with respect to the proper principles of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of Sheridan County (Wyoming) of first-degree felony murder, aggravated burglary, and conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary.

Ann. &sect; 6-2-101(b) (2009), a consecutive 20 to 25 years for the aggravated burglary, and a consecutive 20 to 25 years for the conspiracy. He appealed his convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant committed his crimes at 15. The supreme court held transfer to juvenile court, under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-6-237(b), was correctly denied because (1) statutory factors were reviewed, and (2) his criminal history and crimes outweighed his immaturity and rehabilitation potential. His confession was voluntary because (1) he knew the consequences of waiving his rights, (2) his interrogation was not unduly coercive, and (3) he recommenced dialogue with officers after invoking a right to remain silent. Gunshot residue test results were admissible because the test was a valid search incident to arrest, as (1) it was a minimal intrusion, and (2) the evidence was easily destructible. Expert testimony on his capacity to form criminal intent was irrelevant, under Wyo. R. Evid. 401, because (1) the expert did not say 15-year-olds could not form specific intent, and (2) incapacity based on age was beyond Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-11-302. An ineffective assistance claim based on counsel's failure to interview family failed because he did not show how it would have caused a different result. His life sentence had to be vacated because life without parole for juveniles was effectively mandated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed, but his sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of numerous charges, including false imprisonment, felonious restraint and aggravated assault and battery and the supreme court affirmed, finding no violation of defendant's constitutional rights in the prosecutor's failure to disclose information to the defense or in the district court's discovery orders. There was also no prosecutorial misconduct and no plain error in the sentencing decisions and orders. Defendant failed to provide the district court a sufficient factual basis on which to evaluate his constitutional challenge to the court's disclosure order, and the supreme court was likewise left with no record on which it was able to evaluate the alleged infringement. Thus, it affirmed the rejection of defendant's constitutional challenge to the court's pretrial disclosure order. Additionally, the sentencing was appropriate. The district court reiterated its focus on the incident itself when subsequently during the hearing, the court again referenced the incident and commented on defendant's failure to seek treatment or counseling to address his behavior during the incident.</SPAN></P>

The record indicated the photograph was not listed as a potential exhibit by the State and was not addressed in the district court's memorandum of the pretrial conference. The district court obviously decided no sanction was required for the State's failure to give notice of the photograph. Defendant did not explain specifically how the district court abused its discretion by failing to sanction the prosecution for not listing the photograph as a potential exhibit. He also did not identify any rule of law which prohibited identification through the use of a photograph that was not entered into evidence. In addition, defendant was not prejudiced by the identification procedure because sufficient other evidence of his identity as the perpetrator was presented at trial. The victim testified that her father sexually abused her, and her mother testified that defendant was the child's father.</SPAN></P>

Once the specified period expired, the juvenile offender would become eligible for parole review by the state board of parole, the same as all other parole-eligible offenders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Secretary of State filed a declaratory judgment action in the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming) challenging the constitutionality of Wyoming's term limit statute,&nbsp;Wyo.

The court accepted certification of these issues from the district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary of State was first elected to his office in 2006 and began serving his term in 2007.

Ann. &sect; 22-5-103(a) (2011) would prohibit him from running for another term even though he meets all the constitutional qualifications for holding his office. The court agreed with the Secretary that his claim that &sect; 22-5-103 violated his right to be a candidate involved a matter of great public importance, and the usual requirements for showing a justiciable controversy under the Declaratory Judgment Act could be relaxed. Additionally, the proceedings were genuinely adverse in character because the Secretary was prohibited from seeking a third term. Therefore, the Secretary had established a justiciable controversy. The court held that &sect; 22-5-103 was unconstitutional because Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3 prohibited the passage of any law conditioning political rights and privileges upon a circumstance or condition other than those enumerated, and the right to hold office was one such political right.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 31-6-103(b) (2009) were scrutinized, and (2) advisement of the municipal ordinance was unnecessary, as its criminal penalties had nothing to do with suspension, former Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-6-102(a)(ii) (2009) did not require such advisement, and former Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-6-103(b) (2009) did not authorize the OAH to consider municipal ordinances when deciding if a license should be suspended. It was not error to dismiss the declaratory judgment petition because (1) the drivers' criminal cases were the proper venue to contest the ordinance, (2) the declaratory judgment suit was a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for the criminal cases that could have collaterally estopped the prosecutions, (3) it violated judicial economy, as the issues were litigated in the criminal cases, and (4) it interfered with judicial authority in those cases.</SPAN></P>

He subsequently took a direct appeal on the basis that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-306, the sexual assault sentencing statute, violated the double jeopardy clauses of both the United States and Wyoming Constitutions. The court had previously affirmed. In 2011, appellant filed the motion at issue, claiming factual inaccuracies in the presentence investigation (PSI) report and constitutional violations. On appeal from that motion, the court affirmed. As the district court had determined, appellant's constitutional claims were barred by res judicata because they had either been decided or should have been raised on direct appeal. The fact that &sect; 6-2-306 was amended in 2007 did not change the nature of appellant's double jeopardy claim, which had been decided against him on direct appeal.

The father later filed a petition for custody modification. The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, the court found that a clause in the divorce decree providing that either party's relocation outside Wyoming would constitute a material change of circumstances justifying consideration of custody modification was invalid as speculative, and the trial court properly disregarded the provision. The trial court did not err under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-2-204(c) (2009) in finding that the father had not proven a material change of circumstances. Insufficient evidence was presented to show that the mother's current spouse ever jeopardized the safety and wellbeing of the child. While the trial court erred under Wyo. R. Evid. 803(4) in admitting the mother's testimony concerning statements by the child's allergist, the admission of the testimony was harmless as the father did not meet his burden of showing that the mother's keeping of pets and giving the child allergy medication was a material change of circumstances detrimental to the child.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant entered the house with the intent of confining and terrorizing the victim. Before defendant entered the house, he sounded &quot;Angry. Very angry.&quot; The victim &quot;freaked out&quot; and became &quot;frantically scared.&quot; She explained that defendant was &quot;jealous,&quot; and if he got into the house, &quot;he was going to be very upset with me,&quot; and &quot;it wasn't going to be pretty.&quot; Defendant violently broke in through the back door, smashing glass, and breaking parts of the door jamb. He carried a knife. He pursued the victim when she escaped. He forcibly returned her to the house, and held her in her basement bedroom.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the ex parte TRO was issued in violation of the First Amendment and Wyo. R. Civ. P. 65. The record contained no evidence concerning the injury or potential injury to children from viewing graphic materials (e.g., aborted fetus pictures) displayed by the organization, and of particular importance in the context of the request for injunctive relief, evidence of irreparable harm to the children. The record also contained no evidence that the organization engaged in speech that was directed at inciting violence or was likely to produce imminent lawless action. The town did not meet its burden of establishing that the TRO was necessary to serve the town's interest in protecting youth and that less restrictive measures would not have been adequate. The district court abused its discretion in issuing the TRO without notice to the organization and an opportunity for the organization to be heard. Regarding the bond requirement under rule 65(c), the court concluded that the district court was required to make findings as to the likelihood of harm to the organization, and it abused its discretion in issuing the TRO without those required findings.</SPAN></P>

Although defendant pled guilty to the charged offenses, he subsequently appealed his convictions, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to transfer his case to juvenile court. On review, the court held that the district court did not err in denying defendant's transfer motion because the district court's analysis demonstrated that it exercised the appropriate judicial discretion in denying a transfer; the court thoroughly considered the evidence and argument presented and gave suitable weight to defendant's lack of maturity but ultimately concluded that defendant's diminished problem-solving and critical thinking skills paled in light of the maturity and sophistication exhibited in carrying out the planned burglaries. The district court likewise considered defendant's juvenile history and his failure to complete probation and concluded that, while greater rehabilitative services would be available through the juvenile court, defendant was an unlikely candidate for rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Laramie County, Wyoming, confirmed the denial of appellant workers' request for benefits under the Wyoming Worker's Compensation Act (Act) after appellee Wyoming Workers' Safety and Compensation Division (Division) denied their request and the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) confirmed that denial. The workers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The workers argued that the State's failure to provide benefits was unconstitutional and improper as a matter of law. The supreme court would not address the workers' constitutional arguments as the appeal was not an appropriate avenue for resolution of such an issue. The proper avenue was an independent action for declaratory judgment pursuant to Wyo. R. App. P. 12.12. The workers argued that the Division's application of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27-14-108 was contrary to Wyo. Const. art. 10, &sect; 4 because article 10, &sect; 4 required that the classification be &quot;proper.&quot; The supreme court noted that it was irrelevant that the workers, pursuing the same responsibilities, may be covered by the Act under different employment; the assessment was based on the activities of the employer, not the employee. The Division appropriately assigned to respondent employer a classification based on its primary business within the state of Wyoming. The legislature had made a determination that this classification would not be considered extrahazardous and the employer did not elect to contribute to the state fund. The workers were therefore ineligible for workers' compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>

The district court was not required to merge the different crimes for sentencing. Under the Blockburger test, the offenses were different because each required proof of an element that the other did not. The district court did not err by denying appellant's motion to correct an illegal sentence under Wyo. R. Crim. P. 35(a).

After a preliminary hearing, the attempted kidnapping charge was dismissed without prejudice. Defendant pled guilty to battery and was sentenced to 180 days in jail.

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-1-301(a)(i) and 6-2-201 (2011), was not barred by the doctrine of double jeopardy because battery, in violation of Wyo. Stat.

R. Crim. P. 5.1(c) following a preliminary hearing where a lack of probable cause was found.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sentence imposed by the District Court of Natrona County, Wyoming, following his entry of a guilty plea to a one count of battery, third offense, against a household member under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-501(b), arguing that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-501(f)(ii), which prescribed the punishment for the offense, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with battery against a household member after he violently pulled his girlfriend's hair during an argument. He pled guilty to that offense and was sentenced to a prison term of four to five years; the sentence was suspended in favor of four years of supervised probation. On review of defendant's constitutional challenge to Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-501(f)(ii), the court held that the statute was not ambiguous. A plain language interpretation suggested that the term &quot;after&quot; was used as a conjunction to introduce the phrase &quot;having been convicted within the previous 10 years.&quot; Under that interpretation, the statute simply required that a third battery offense must have occurred within 10 years of a previous battery or other enumerated crime. Further, the penalty portion of the statute set forth a clear and logical progression from a first battery as set forth in &sect; 6-2-501(d), to a second battery as set forth in &sect; 6-2-501(f)(i), to a third or subsequent battery as set forth in &sect; 6-2-501(f)(ii). In addition, the lead-in paragraph to Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-501(f)(i) and (f)(ii) indicated that the penalty prescribed in subsection (f)(ii) applied to a third battery.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 1, &sect; 4, protected public school students from unreasonable searches and seizures, the testing at issue was reasonable. Students were already subject to more stringent rules and regulations than adults and had limited expectations of privacy in the school setting. The school district had a compelling interest in providing for the safety and welfare of its students and thus had a legitimate interest in deterring drug and alcohol use among students. Further, the policy requiring random, suspicionless drug and alcohol testing for all students who participated in extracurricular activities was rationally related to furthering its interest in deterring drug and alcohol use among students.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of a decision from the District Court of Albany County (Wyoming), which ruled that its property was lawfully included in appellee water and sewer district and that the district lawfully issued certain general obligation bonds. The owner also challenged, by submitting certified questions to the court, the refusal of the board of county commissioners to exclude its property from the district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">More than 10 years after its property was included in the district, the owner learned that the district intended to issue general obligation bonds to fund an improvement project and that a tax would be levied against property in the district to repay the bonds. The owner then objected to the inclusion of its property on the ground that it had not consented under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-10-102(c) (2009). The court held that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-10-107(g) (2009) barred the action because the owner did not follow the procedure specified for a challenge to the organization of a district. Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-10-128 (2009) did not require the district to issue revenue bonds. The proposed general obligation bond issue did not violate the indebtedness limitation in Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-10-127 (2009) because the exception for supplying water, set forth in &sect; 41-10-127 and in Wyo. Const. art. 16, &sect; 5, applied. Although the board had authority under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-10-103(b), 41-10-120 to remove property from the district, the lapse or sunsetting of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-29-307 (2009) left no statutory procedure available for doing so; thus, the owner's petition was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's determinations that the owner was barred from contesting the inclusion of part of its property in the district and that the proposed general obligation bond issue was valid. The court affirmed the board's decision not to exclude the owner's property from the district, concluding that although a board had the power and authority to remove real property from a district, no statutory procedure was available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Laramie County, Wyoming, affirmed a decision of appellee State Board of Equalization (SBOE) that certain sales by appellant taxpayer were subject to Wyoming sales tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that the sale documents showed that the parties intended for change of possession to happen in the buyer's home state and the buyer had only constructive possession until the vehicle actually arrived at the buyer's residence either because delivery was made by a third party, a common carrier, or because the customer was acting as his/her own delivery agent. The supreme court found it was appropriate for the SBOE to rely on the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as an objective test to determine when title passed. An objective analysis indicated that transfer of possession occurred in Wyoming. A customer who picked up a vehicle in Wyoming had actual possession at the time of pick-up. The sale therefore occurred in Wyoming and was properly taxed. The collection of sales taxes on the vehicles did not violate U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8 as the sales taxes were not collected because the taxpayer incorrectly believed that they were not due. This was not a basis for allowing the taxpayer any tax credit for taxes subsequently paid in other states.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Wyoming, Department of Transportation (DOT), sought review of a decision entered by the District Court of Uinta County (Wyoming), which determined that appellee driver's commercial driver's license (CDL) disqualification could only be upheld under a clear and convincing evidence standard and that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 31-7-305(e) and 31-7-307 (2007) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the driver was reported by clerks at a port of entry as having an odor of alcohol on his breath, a state trooper made contact with him; the driver admitted to drinking earlier in the day. The driver submitted to several breathalyzer tests and was issued a citation for violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-701(a) (2007). A contested case hearing was held on a notice of disqualification of the driver's CDL, and the disqualification was upheld. After a petition for review was denied based on the constitutional issues raised, the driver filed the instant declaratory judgment action. On appeal, the court reversed. Because a driver's license was not a fundamental right, but a privilege, under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-7-102(a)(xxv) (2009), due process was not violated by the utilization of a preponderance of the evidence in license revocation proceedings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of an order from the District Court of Uinta County (Wyoming), which upheld an order from respondent, the Wyoming Workers' Safety and Compensation Division, denying his claim for benefits for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a volunteer firefighter. During a fire at an apartment building, he observed two of his fellow firefighters who had been in the building during an explosion. Their bodies were burned beyond recognition. Both firefighters died from their injuries. Petitioner developed PTSD and MDD as a result of the incident. The Division denied benefits for treatment of the PTSD and MDD on the basis that the injuries were mental in nature and not compensable under the definition of &quot;injury&quot; in Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27-14-102(a)(xi)(J) (2009). The trial court upheld the decision. On appeal, the court found that under &sect; 27-14-102(a)(xi)(J), the requisite &quot;physical injury&quot; had to be something outside of the biological changes in the brain associated with mental disorders. Petitioner was diagnosed as having PTSD and MDD by reference to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. By definition, his ailments were &quot;mental&quot; in nature. Given that he did not contend that his PTSD and MDD were caused by his compensable physical injuries, burns or smoke inhalation, a hearing examiner properly concluded that his mental injuries were not compensable under Wyoming law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wyoming Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) rated appellant's claim for additional workers' compensation permanent partial impairment (PPI) benefits using the 6th edition of the American Medical Association (AMA) Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment. The District Court of Sweetwater County (Wyoming) affirmed the OAH's decision. Appellant challenged the OAH's order denying his claim for additional PPI benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court determined that a PPI rating had to be made based on the most recent edition of the AMA Guides at the time appellant reached maximum medical improvement. Appellant's maximum medical improvement occurred after his second surgery. At that time, the 6th edition was the most recent edition of the AMA Guides. Appellant essentially asserted that the 6th edition did not provide the most reliable guidance in determining a PPI rating, which he supported with excerpts from a letter from his surgeon which described the 6th edition as ambiguous and difficult to interpret. However, the doctor that appellee, the Wyoming Workers' Safety and Compensation Division, referred appellant to performed a PPI rating and did not indicate that the 6th edition was unworkable or unreliable. Moreover, the supreme court was not in a position to decide which edition provided the most reliable guidance. The legislature clearly intended that the PPI be rated using the most recent edition at the time of the ascertainable loss. Thus, the OAH's determination that appellant's PPI was properly rated according to the 6th edition was in accordance with Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27-14-405 (2007).</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the determination of what was obscene or indecent was made in the context of the presence of a person of the tender age of fifteen years or under. A jury would not find certain actions to be morally improper or depraved. The supreme court accepted that defendant was masturbating in the presence of a little girl who was eight years old at the time, making her a child within the meaning of the statute. Masturbation in the presence of a child was &quot;indecent&quot; under the indecent liberties statute.&nbsp;Section 6-4-403(b)(iii) was not vague as applied to defendant's conduct. Defendant could not claim that he was misled by the nature of the charge or surprised by the evidence presented at trial. Defendant failed to establish that the district court violated a clear and unequivocal rule of law by instructing the jury on the definition of &quot;obscene or indecent act.&quot; The district court did not err by treating the terms &quot;obscene or indecent&quot; as a single element and not providing a special verdict form to force the jury to choose between the alternatives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of converting to his own use funds his employer placed in a Wyoming checking account. The court affirmed on appeal. Appellant argued that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to prosecute him because he had never been to Wyoming, but the court disagreed. Appellant wrote unauthorized checks on a Wyoming bank account, which deprived a Wyoming victim of her money, appellant's actions outside the state resulted in a crime in the state, and the trial court was entitled to exercise jurisdiction because the criminal conduct and result took place in Wyoming. The information and jury instructions did not vary and contained the same elements, such that appellant was not subjected to an unconstitutional variance. The jury had asked for the meaning of the term owner within the meaning of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-3-402(b) (2009). Appellant did not show that the term had a meaning within the statute that was different from its common meaning, and the trial court did not violate a clear rule of law when it did not provide the dictionary definition or when it instructed the jury to determine the issue as a factual matter.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-6-203 (2009), was not considered in the district court and was not reflected at all by the record on appeal. The supreme court declined to further consider the issue. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to transfer the case from the district court to the juvenile court where the offense was an extremely serious, violent attack upon a uniformed police officer and the offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated or willful manner. Defendant had a long and detailed criminal history and had shown a pattern of breaking the law. The specific enumeration of the elements in the body of the instruction fully informed the jury of the evidence the State was required to produce in order to justify a conviction. The trial court's limitation of defendant's expert witness testimony did not arise to the level of an abuse of discretion. Although defendant could have pursued an intoxication defense, he did not. The failure of the district court to given such an instruction sua sponte did not prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Hot Springs County, Wyoming, found that, with slight changes, the best interests of the parties' children were being served by the existing shared custody and visitation plan; that no grounds to modify the prior custody arrangement that existed; and that appellee father was not in contempt for violating the judgment and decree of divorce. Appellant mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the trial evidence and testimony demonstrated that continuing with the parties' shared custody arrangement would not promote stability in the children's milieu and was contrary to the children's best interests. The supreme court found that the record showed that the district court accepted the testimony on the father's relationships with his other children and grandchildren by both parties and did not commit any procedural error as to the consideration and weight given to this testimony. The district court properly removed the residency provision from the shared custody plan. It was justified in including visitation in the custody arrangement as being in the children's best interests. The mother did not meet her burden of proof in showing that the father was in contempt for disobeying the decree, and the father had not repeatedly refused to allow the mother to recover lost time with the children. Neither party had willfully denied custodial nor visitation rights of the other; the father had participated in mediation in good faith; and there had not been willful violations of court orders by either party.</SPAN></P>

The Wyoming State Penitentiary's Inmate Rules Handbook did not create a constitutionally protected right for inmates to keep property in their cells or right to any income derived from that property. Because the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1-39-101 through 121 (LexisNexis 2009), did not differentiate between inmates and non-inmates, it did not deny the inmate equal protection of the law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court concluded that the district court erred in permanently placing the mother's children with the foster parents for adoption, rather than with their aunt and uncle as provided for under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-3-208(a)(iii) (2009). The compelling preference as to what was best for the children was placement with nuclear or extended family members. The reunification process the mother sought to pursue was done in Casper, and the aunt and uncle lived in a Montana town that was 300 miles away from Casper. Thus, the bonds between the uncle and aunt with the mother's daughter had been interrupted for almost two years, and there was little bond at all with the mother's son. The district court determined that the outcome of this case was fixed early on in the proceedings when the mother chose to do her reunification work in Casper, during which time the children were placed with the foster parents. By the time that concluded in failure, the district court found that it was too late to go back and consider the kinship placement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the district court's sua sponte revision of the trial transcript was improper; the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of defendant's alleged use of methamphetamine; and the second-degree murder statute was facially unconstitutional. The supreme court found that defendant failed to prove that the district court acted unreasonably in ordering the trial transcript to be amended to comport with the actual testimony. Defendant also failed to prove that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony about defendant's jailhouse confession, or the testimony as to methamphetamine. This testimony was admissible as a non-hearsay admission by a party opponent, it was directly relevant to defendant's state of mind at the time of the crime, and it was reasonable for the district court to find it more probative than unfairly prejudicial. Once defendant's admission of methamphetamine use was admitted, there existed a foundation for the testimony about his methamphetamine use. Defendant's argument that the second-degree murder statute was unconstitutional was rendered moot when the jury acquitted him of that charge.</SPAN></P>

Defendant one entered a conditional plea of guilty to sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree. Defendant two, who was 39 years old, pled guilty to two counts of sexual abuse of a minor in the third degree. The victim was 15 years, four months, and 25 days old. On appeal, defendants claimed that the statutes under which they were convicted should have been construed to mean that if the victims were one day or more past his/her 15th birthday, then the respective statutes did not criminalize the conduct at issue. The court held that the challenged statutes were not ambiguous and that their meaning and scope could be readily determined by reading the sexual assault statutes in pari materia. When the statutes at issue were read in pari materia with all of the sexual assault statutes, there was no uncertainty as to the reach of the statutes. The court rejected defendants' statutory construction contentions, as well as their unconstitutionally vague as applied challenges.</SPAN></P>

The victim was the 15-year-old daughter of a coworker. The victim was a reluctant witness and testified that her relationship with defendant was entirely voluntary and consensual. On appeal, defendant claimed that evidence was improperly admitted at his trial pursuant to Wyo. R. Evid. 404(b). The evidence consisted of testimony from a fellow employee of defendant's. Her testimony was offered for the purpose of showing that defendant had a &quot;guilty mind,&quot; to rebut the story he gave to the police, and to test his credibility. The court found that although the trial court did not specifically address the question of post-crime, &quot;guilty mind&quot; evidence, the trial court would have been correct in admitting the disputed evidence on the basis that Rule 404(b) analysis did not apply to post-crime &quot;guilty mind&quot; evidence such as that offered by the State.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An informant told law enforcement officers that he had recently been in defendant's residence and purchased methamphetamine from defendant the night before. His admission was a statement against his penal interests and had sufficient indicia of reliability. Exigent circumstances justified the officers' warrantless entry into defendant's residence to ensure that there was no one inside who might destroy evidence or threaten officer safety. They then left the residence and waited outside for the search warrant. The district court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence of marijuana, methamphetamine, and psilocybin mushrooms; the challenged evidence was obtained during execution of the search warrant. The Supreme Court of Wyoming held that defendant did not have standing to challenge the search of his fiancee's vehicle. While the trial was delayed six times due to defendant's changes of counsel, his right to a speedy trial was not violated as a result of the 500-day delay. Defendant waived his right to a speedy trial on two occasions, and showed no prejudice to his defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver; the supreme court affirmed. Defendant failed to demonstrate that the method used by the district court clerk in selecting jurors from the master list in alphabetical order deprived him of a fair cross section of the community or that any distinctive group was systematically excluded from the jury panel. Thus, the district court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash the jury panel. The supreme court did not approve of the method used because there were other more tried and true methods available that eliminated the concerns raised by the appeal. The current method was also not to be used in any future cases. However, the supreme court was unable to conclude that the jury selected violated the crux of the random selection requirement. To the extent that its use was an improper deviation from what the governing statutes required, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1-11-106 through 1-11-109, the error, if any, was harmless. Further, the district court clearly considered probation at sentencing, despite unfortunate remarks earlier in the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A river basin had been a rich source of CBM production. In order to extract CBM, the producer must remove underground water from the coal seam, resulting in the production of large quantities of water. Producers were required to obtain a groundwater well permit from the State Engineer. At issue was whether the property owners' claim was justiciable. When the supreme court examined the relief requested by the property owners in their declaratory judgment action, the supreme court found no allegation as to how that relief would redress or prevent the damage they claimed their property incurred or will certainly incur in the future. Even if the supreme court were to consider the public interest, a practical effect on the property owners was not shown. The property owners were not entitled to a declaratory judgment that the State's actions violated the rights of other persons. Further, there were administrative remedies available to the property owners for many of their complaints, and they apparently had not availed themselves of those procedures. The property owners' claims were simply too general to be justiciable.</SPAN></P>

They immediately returned home and found defendant in bed with the children, naked from the waist down and with an erect penis. The police were summoned and found defendant in possession in marijuana. On review, the court held that counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to dismiss the indecent liberties charges on the ground that the statute had been repealed because, under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1-107 (2007), the repeal of a statute did not affect pending prosecutions. Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise a baseless argument. Further, counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the introduction of the boyfriend's statement that defendant was a rapist because the statement was not hearsay where it was not offered to show the truth of the matter asserted but to show why the pair returned so quickly.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that the district and the employee were immune from liability under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act (WGCA), Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-39-101 et seq. (2007). Upon review, the court determined that the WGCA did provide governmental immunity to the irrigation district as it was a governmental entity for purposes of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-39-104(a) (2007). Furthermore, the district did not supply water to or for the public and therefore, was not a public utility under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37-1-101(a) (2007). Because the district was not a public utility its governmental immunity was not waived under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-39-108(a) (2007). In addition, the court determined that while the owner could have brought claims against the employee alleging that he had acted outside the scope of his employment, the owner failed to do so. All of the allegations against the employee were as a worker of the district and in such capacity, the employee was subjected to governmental immunity under &sect; 1-39-104(a).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because it showed that the victim went to the home where defendant lived to buy drugs, that the victim was seen getting into a truck similar to that owned by defendant shortly before her body was discovered, that defendant's semen was found inside the victim's body, and that sexual intercourse occurred shortly before the victim's death. Although the evidence that defendant had committed the murder was circumstantial, the jury was permitted to make reasonable inferences, and it was logical to infer, based upon the evidence presented, that defendant killed the victim. The court further rejected defendant's argument that there was insufficient evidence to show that he acted purposely. As used in Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-104 (2007), &quot;purposely&quot; meant &quot;intentionally.&quot; Where the victim had been hit on the head more than once, had been run over more than once, and suffered significant head trauma and where the victim's body was found 50 feet off the road, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's conclusion that the homicide was committed purposely and with malice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school districts filed an action against defendant Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction, seeking a judgment declaring that a 2006 amendment to Wyo. Const. art. 15, &sect; 17 did not repeal Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-13-102(c) (2006) (repealed 2008), and that they were not required to pay tax revenue they received to the State. The District Court of Sublette County (Wyoming) certified the question to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wyoming Department of Education interpreted a 2006 Amendment to Wyo. Const. art. 15, &sect; 17 as necessarily repealing Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-13-102(c) (2006), and it informed several school districts in March 2007 that they were in violation of the law because they retained part of the taxes collected from property owners. The districts sued the Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction, seeking a declaration that they did not have to pay taxes they retained, and the district court certified the question of whether the 2006 Amendment impliedly repealed Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-13-102(c) (2006) to the state supreme court. The supreme court held that the 2006 Amendment did not impliedly repeal &sect; 21-13-102(c) (2006), and school districts that sued the State were not required to rebate an additional 25% of their excess local funds for fiscal years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008. The statute remained in effect until it was repealed in 2008, and the 75% limit on the special school district property tax rebate imposed by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-13-102(c) (2006) (repealed 2008) remained in place for the fiscal years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 for all Wyoming school districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-13-102(c) (2006) (repealed 2008) was not impliedly repealed in 2006 when voters approved an amendment to Wyo. Const. art. 15, &sect; 17, and remanded the case to the district court.</SPAN></P>

The district court ruled that the Department lacked authority to disqualify the driver because he had not been convicted of a crime. Thus, the Department and the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant kidnapped, raped, tortured, and murdered a young woman he did not know at an isolated bus where he lived. He may have had her in his bus home for seven days before bludgeoning and stabbing her. Among other arguments, defendant contended that he was not competent to stand trial, that his counsel was deficient during both the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial, and that the trial judge was biased against him. At trial, defendant did not contend that he was incompetent to stand trial nor did he enter a plea asserting an insanity defense. The court held that defendant's outbursts during trial and his uncooperativeness with his counsel due to alleged depression did not render defendant incompetent as contemplated by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-11-302 (2007). A thorough hearing was held on the alleged ineffectiveness of counsel, including his illness during the trial, and the court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that trial counsel was not ineffective despite failing to hire an independent DNA expert, failing to call certain witnesses during the sentencing phase, admitting guilt to first degree murder, and failing to pursue a change of venue, among other things.</SPAN></P>

The district court ruled that the Private School Licensing Act (Act), Wyo. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university argued that the Act and the Department's final rules violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Wyoming Constitution. It claimed that the Act and the final rules created two separate classes: accredited schools and nonaccredited schools. The supreme court agreed with the district court that no classification had been created by the Act. The Act regulated one specific well-defined class: private degree-granting post-secondary educational institutions. All organizations had to be accredited. Those institutions that were not accredited had to become accredited within the time frame provided. different classifications were not created under the Act or the rules adopted by the Department. The requirement of accreditation, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-2-402(b), did not violate the Wyoming Constitution. Applicants had sufficient guarantees of due process, and the delegation was reasonable. It was reasonable to require the university to be accredited by a private entity. The need of the state to protect citizens outweighed the contract rights of the university.</SPAN></P>

The second statement did not infringe upon his right to remain silent. Defendant failed to demonstrate any prejudice from the prosecutor's comments. The prosecutor improperly vouching for the veracity of the law enforcement officers and the quality of their investigation was not significant in light of eyewitness testimony regarding the incident. Defense counsel's advice for defendant not to testify was reasonable. Calling a witness would serve no useful purpose. Defendant failed to establish that his trial counsel was ineffective because he did not call an officer as a witness at trial. The defense investigator was properly prohibited from testifying at trial. There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of attempted second degree murder as the stabbing, together with testimony from the victim and other witnesses, made it reasonable to infer that defendant stabbed the victim and did so purposely. The district court did not allow an excessive display of security. Defendant waived his constitutional challenge on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought to overturn his 1982 criminal conviction for possessing and cultivating marijuana. The State asserted that plaintiff's claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata because they were raised and decided against plaintiff in a prior declaratory judgment action. On appeal, plaintiff focused his attention exclusively on the constitutionality of Wyoming marijuana statutes, reasserting the same claims raised in the prior declaratory judgment action. The instant court noted that the district court dismissed plaintiff's claims on res judicata grounds, and plaintiff did not present any legal argument directly challenging the district court's determination. That failure was fatal to plaintiff's appeal. Additionally, plaintiff did not appeal his 1982 conviction in which he could have asked that it be overturned. In this appeal, plaintiff presented no legal argument to support that untimely request now. Consequently, plaintiff's conviction was res judicata as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, 30 school districts, the state education association, and the state school board association, filed a petition in the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming) that the State had not eliminated wealth-based and educational opportunity disparities in Wyoming's school finance and capital construction systems. The district court found that the State had failed to meet some of its constitutional mandates. All of the parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the legislature was committed to assuring that teachers' salaries and benefits in Wyoming remained adequate to deliver a constitutionally sound public education system. Also, the supreme court held that, so long as the State relied upon a cost of education model, regional cost of living adjustments could not reduce salaries below those which the State's model established as the statewide cost of hiring educational personnel. Additionally, the State's approach to funding operation and maintenance of a school district's facilities did not violate the Equal Protection Clause under Wyo. Const. art. I, &sect; 34 since the differences in funding between school districts was based upon the costs deemed appropriate by the legislature. In addition, the supreme court found that the regulatory scheme providing for the construction and maintenance of educational facilities was facially constitutional. But, there was a possibility that the implementation of the facilities commission's guidelines was contrary to the statutory scheme. In the future, the commission had to consider exception requests regarding the construction of facilities in light of the statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed those portions of the district court's judgment finding that the State had not complied with the constitutional mandates. However, the facilities commission had to properly implement its guidelines in accordance with the statutory scheme chosen to fund school construction. Also, problems with the application of the cost of living index were corrected. Finally, the supreme court did not retain jurisdiction over the case.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 6-4-303(a)(ii)(B) was unconstitutional on its face and its application toward defendant. The supreme court determined that defendant admitted that the visual images that constituted Counts I and VII were child pornography, and there was evidence adduced by the State that established that they were real children, not just images virtually indistinguishable from children. A trier of fact was capable of determining whether real children were used in pornographic images simply by viewing the images themselves. Whether the statute was vague or overbroad had to be determined in a case where the image at issue was alleged to be that of an individual virtually indistinguishable from a child, but not actually a child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The maximum square footage allowed by the Teton County Land Development Regulations was 8,000 square feet of habitable space. Immediately following the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the 8,000 square foot home, the homeowners enlarged the home to 11,000 square feet by converting porches to habitable space, and by flooring in rooms with cathedral ceilings so as to provide more habitable space. The district court refused to order the removal of the excessive square footage. The district court properly considered the size, character, and use of the house and interest the County had in enforcement of its regulations. The district court's balancing of the equities was supported by the evidence and within its sound discretion. Under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 18-5-204, 18-5-206, the homeowners were required to pay a fine for each day they violated the habitable space regulation for a total of 242 days.

After the female juror was approached by the girlfriend, the juror immediately terminated the contact and notified the bailiff. The court was informed and through the bailiff contacted the juror to ensure that her level of ease at serving on defendant's jury was not compromised. Furthermore, the trial court spoke with counsel about ensuring the avoidance of any contact between families and jurors after the verdict was read and specifically answered juror questions and concerns about their safety after trial. After reviewing the record developed specifically to address the issue, the supreme court concluded that the trial court's actions regarding the note were appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not commit plain error by admitting a counselor's testimony describing the victims, defendant's two daughters, as compliant under Wyo. R. Evid. 404(a), because: (1) the testimony related directly to the victims, whose recantation of prior statements was a prominent issue at trial; (2) the counselor's testimony regarding the victims' perceptions of defendant did not implicate his character; (3) several questions clarified that the counselor had not seen or spoken to defendant and had no particular opinion of him; and (4) the victims' perceptions of defendant was important in explaining their behavior, not his. The counselor's statement regarding typical incestuous families was properly admitted because it was helpful to the jury to decide what to make of the various excuses for the changing stories. The court rejected defendant's claim that Wyo. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An administrative hearing decision revoked petitioner commercial truck driver's commercial driver's license. The driver filed a petition for review, arguing that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-7-305(n) (2005) was unconstitutional. The District Court of Laramie County, Wyoming, dismissed the driver's petition. The district court also dismissed the driver's petition for declaratory judgment. The driver appealed both judgments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver argued that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-7-305(n) (2005) violated his equal protection rights by inflicting a greater burden on commercial drivers than non-commercial drivers. The driver conceded that the instant court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 31-7-305 in a prior action. The instant court found that the driver's briefs included no persuasive argument for revisiting the issue and overturning the prior action. Section 31-7-305(n) did not violate the driver's equal protection rights. Because Wyoming's equal protection guarantee was broader than the equivalent federal right, the instant court's adherence to the prior action effectively disposed of the driver's federal constitutional claim. Next, the driver contended that the hearing examiner had no power to suspend his driver's license under &sect; 31-7-305(n). The instant court refused to consider the driver's argument because the driver did not raise the issue before the hearing examiner, nor did he pursue it on direct review in the district court, under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16-3-114(c)(ii)(C) (2005). The first time the driver mentioned the issue was in his declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant father began paying an extra $ 50 per month in an effort to pay off his child support obligation in advance. The father did so of his own volition and not at the request of plaintiff mother. The father ceased all child support payments. At a hearing on a petition to modify child support, the District Court of Natrona County, Wyoming, ruled that the father was not entitled to a credit for the overpayments. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that his overpayment should have been credited to his current obligation. Because this was an issue of first impression in Wyoming, the instant court looked to other states' treatment of the issue of overpayment of child support in an effort to gain a so-called &quot;credit.&quot; For the most part, courts generally did not allow a credit to an obligor spouse for voluntary expenditures made on behalf of a child in a manner other than that specified by a decree. Wyoming law was instructive because both statutes, including Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-2-311 (2007), and case law indicated a clear aversion to the unilateral modification of child support orders. The father overpaid the obligation intentionally. He unilaterally modified that obligation without court approval. The father testified that he paid voluntarily. The instant court found that the circumstances did not warrant application of the exception to the general rule. It was the father's obligation to pay the specified amounts according to the decree, and orders modifying it thereafter. The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give the father credit for overpayment of his child support obligation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted second degree murder for cutting the victim's throat with a knife. At trial, defendant claimed that he was too intoxicated to form the specific intent necessary to support a conviction of attempted second degree murder. The trial court instructed the jury that use of a deadly weapon raised mandatory presumptions of an intent to kill and malice. Reversing, the court held that the mandatory presumption instructions were improper and were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The instructions deprived defendant of a substantial right resulting in material prejudice. Under Wyo. R. Evid. 303(b), the trial court was required to tell the jury that a presumption was permissive, not mandatory, in criminal cases. Neither the malice instruction nor the intent instruction told the jury that the presumption was not mandatory and that it could refuse to apply it. Thus, those instructions violated both Rule 303(b) and the Fourteenth Amendment. Further, plain error was found because the force of the evidence was not so overwhelming as to leave it beyond a reasonable doubt that the verdict would have been the same without the presumptions.</SPAN></P>

Trial counsel's failure to pursue the services of an accident reconstruction expert constituted deficient performance because the exact nature of how the collision occurred was vital to defendant's defense. Defendant contended that despite his BAC, the accident occurred because the other driver turned left into defendant's lane without prior notice. Defendant was prejudiced by counsel's failure because his expert would have testified that the collision was unavoidable and discredited the troopers' opinions as to the cause of the collision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land developers filed suit against appellee board of county commissioners, seeking a declaration that certain county land development regulations were unconstitutional, ultra vires, and consequently unenforceable. The District Court of Teton County, Wyoming, granted the board's motion to dismiss some of the counts, and subsequently granted the board's motion for summary judgment on the remaining count. The developers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the developers raised several issues challenging the dismissal of their claims. The supreme court found that approximately four and a half years after the developers' subdivision plan was approved, they filed the instant declaratory judgment action. When they filed this action, all but four of the lots in the subdivision had been sold, gifted, or reserved for their business. The board objected to the developers' declaratory judgment action because it was filed so long after approval of the subdivision and challenged it on the bases of estoppel, laches, and/or waiver. The supreme court concluded that these defenses provided an appropriate basis for affirming the trial court's dismissal of the developers' takings claims, without considering the substance of their constitutional challenges, because they did not contest the conditions in a timely manner. And because the developers no longer had a &quot;tangible interest&quot; in the validity of the land development regulations, they did not have standing to present a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the open space or affordable housing regulations.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 31-7-307 as it applied only to drivers arrested for driving while under the influence while driving a commercial motor; here, the driver was not driving or in control of a commercial motor vehicle when he was stopped and arrested.

The supreme court disagreed. The State presented the expert testimony of a drug task force agent who testified that in his opinion the person who possessed the items seized was engaged in drug trafficking. Specifically, he testified that the scales, packaging material, and quantities of methamphetamine found in the pencil case in the car, and the amount of money defendant was carrying were indicative of someone engaged in drug trafficking. The witness testified the other items seized were indicative of someone engaged in using methamphetamine, specifically, the lighter found on defendant and the spoons and syringes found in the car. Defendant was under the influence of methamphetamine when he was arrested and had used and possessed marijuana prior to his arrest the same day. The drugs were found in the car under the seat in which defendant had been sitting. A reasonable inference could be made from the quantities of methamphetamine, the paraphernalia, and the amount of cash defendant was carrying that he possessed the methamphetamine with the intent to deliver it to others.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the primary jurisdiction doctrine was inapplicable because no genuine issues of material fact existed; only questions of law were presented, and no threshold determinations would be better made by an agency with expertise. Exhaustion of remedies was not required under Wyo. Stat.

Two teenage girls were awoken and told the officers that their parents were probably down by the lake. The officers looked through the home for the EMT and did not find her in her home, but they did find a system for growing mushrooms in a bedroom. The officers found the EMT in another location and later returned to the home with a search warrant. The supreme court determined that the search of the residence was constitutional under the Fourth Amendment and Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 4 because the emergency assistance exception applied. The officers were acting reasonably when they investigated the possible emergency and properly limited their efforts to determining whether anyone was in need of assistance rather than investigating a crime.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Platte County (Wyoming) denied defendant's motion to suppress. Subsequently, the trial court convicted defendant, upon his conditional plea, of one count of felony possession of a controlled substance, methamphetamine. Defendant appealed, contending that the traffic stop was pretextual in nature and violated Wyo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not dispute that he was speeding. He admitted that a police officer had probable cause to initiate a traffic stop based upon personal observation of the speeding violation. He asserted, however, that he was stopped for the infraction only because of the underlying motive of the officer to search for narcotics. The underlying motive, according to defendant, rendered the stop unconstitutional at its inception. The supreme court found that a traffic stop initiated by a law enforcement officer after personally observing a traffic violation was supported by probable cause and did not violate Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 4, regardless of the officer's primary motivation. However, the scope, duration, and intensity of the seizure, as well as any search made by the police subsequent to that stop, remained subject to the strictures of Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 4, and judicial review. The officer personally observed defendant's traffic violation and had probable cause to initiate the traffic stop. The scope, duration, and intensity of the seizure, after the initial stop, were not contested by defendant. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was substantial evidence that showed the accountant participated in the audit prior to having approval to do so and that the settlement agreement applied to both the accountant and his firm. The court also noted that while the agreement violation, alone, probably did not amount to dishonesty under &sect; 33-3-121(a)(ii), the accountant's attempt to legitimize his activity by using other accountants as the signing auditors was dishonest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-3-105(a) (2005) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to his conduct. Defendant argued that &sect; 14-3-105(a) proscribed sexual assault, and that inherent in that proscription was a requirement that there be contact between defendant and the victim. The conduct underlying the indecent liberties charge against him was the videotaping, not the physical contact between him and the victim, and there was no evidence that the victim had any knowledge of the videotaping. Since videotaping by itself was not a sexual assault, defendant concluded that the statute did not prohibit the discreet video recording of minors even if the act being recorded was indecent. The supreme court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 14-3-105(a) did not proscribe the discreet video recording of minors engaged in indecent acts. The common sense of society would regard the videotaping of sexual acts with a seven-year-old child as a violation of the statute, and a person of ordinary intelligence had sufficient notice that such conduct was against the law.</SPAN></P>

On two occasions, they had sexual intercourse. When the victim's mother found out she reported the matter to police. Upon questioning by police, defendant admitted to having sexual intercourse with the victim on two occasions. Defendant was arrested and charged with one count of taking immodest, immoral, or indecent liberties with a child in violation of &sect;&nbsp;14-3-105. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of that statute. The supreme court had considered and soundly rejected facial vagueness challenges to &sect; 14-3-105. Additionally, although defendant briefly mentioned the lack of an extreme age difference as a mitigating factor, he admitted that he understood that his conduct was wrong and that he should have waited until the victim was 18 years old before having sex with her. Under those specific circumstances, and in the absence of any evidence that the statute was enforced in a discriminatory manner, the supreme court held that &sect; 14-3-105 was not vague as applied to defendant's conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State failed to provide to defendant a police report that contained defendant's statement to a trooper before trial. When the trooper referred to a report that contained defendant's statement during his cross-examination, the defense requested and was granted a mistrial. As a sanction against the State, the district court dismissed with prejudice the charge against defendant. On appeal, the court held that even though the district court had the authority, under Wyo. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2), to dismiss the charge with prejudice, it abused its discretion by doing so without conducting the appropriate inquiry to determine whether the sanction was justified. The district court made no findings as to the reasons why the State did not produce the report, it made no findings about the prejudice that would be suffered by defendant if the charge was not dismissed with prejudice, and the it did not discuss whether prejudice could be cured by a less severe sanction such as a continuance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping and aggravated assault after he and another inmate attacked penitentiary employees and held them as hostages. The jury found defendant to be an habitual criminal and sentenced him to 2 concurrent life sentences for the crimes committed in the penitentiary. Those sentences were consecutive to other sentences already imposed in older cases. Defendant filed a motion to correct his sentence under Wyo. R. Crim.

On appeal, the court found that defendant was attempting to challenge his convictions and sentences that had been affirmed, and based his challenges on claims that were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court held that defendant failed to provide any cogent argument or authority to establish that the court should appoint counsel for him for his appeal. The court concluded that defendant had exhausted all of his state remedies with respect to his convictions, and authorized the district court to decline to permit the filing of any further papers from defendant that related to those convictions, unless defendant had first obtained the consent of the district court for such a filing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a conditional guilty plea in the Natrona County District Court, Wyoming, to unlawful possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a violent felony in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-8-102 (2005). Defendant appealed the district court's ruling on two pretrial motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court should have granted his motion to dismiss because he was charged under an unconstitutionally vague statute. He also argued the district court erred by granting the State's motion in limine precluding him from presenting evidence that he did not knowingly violate the law. Defendant did not dispute that he was a violent felon or that it was unlawful for him to possess firearms. However, defendant claimed that he did not violate the statute because the muzzle-loading black powder rifle he purchased was not a firearm. The instant court concluded that a muzzle-loading black powder rifle fell within the definition of &quot;firearm&quot; as contemplated by &sect; 6-8-102. The statute, by its plain terms, prohibited an unpardoned violent felon from possessing any firearm. Defendant failed to provide even one situation where the application of the statute was uncertain, much less that it was vague in all of its applications, as he was required to do. Defendant also failed to establish he was the victim of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The district court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss and properly granted the State's motion in limine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When community correction facility authorities learned that defendant was signed out of the facility to go to work, but she no longer had a job, defendant was charged with escape. At issue on appeal was whether, among other things, (1) &sect; 7-18-112 was unconstitutional because it was facially vague; (2) &sect; 7-18-112 was unconstitutional as applied in defendant's case; and (3) the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of escape. Although defendant challenged the statute's constitutionality, the appellate court determined that defendant waived this issue by not challenging the constitutionality of the statute before the district court. The supreme court rejected defendant's argument. Defendant had fair warning that her conduct could be considered escape without reference to the statute. There was no question that defendant was in official detention. When defendant left the facility to go to a plaza, where she was allegedly employed but then did not work, she went outside the extended limits of her confinement. Defendant was guilty of escape if she left the facility for the purpose of going to work but then never worked during the time she was away from the facility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, defendants, two registered sex offenders, challenged the finding of the District Court of Natrona County (Wyoming) that the Wyoming Sex Offender Registration Act, former Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-19-301 et seq., (2003) requiring appellee State to prove their risk of reoffense by a preponderance of the evidence, was constitutional and rejecting defendants' argument that the State's evidence had to be clear and convincing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that clear and convincing evidence was required in determining the risk of reoffense because their interests, and the risk of erroneous deprivation of those interests, outweighed any government interest. Defendants identified their affected interests as being privacy and liberty. The Supreme Court of Wyoming held that the Act did not violate the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. It was a legitimate regulatory device, with the primary goal of protecting the public. The governmental interest outweighed the offender's rights to privacy and liberty, and it was appropriate that the risk of classification error be borne equally by the State and the offender. The statutory scheme provided the offender with notice and a right to be heard, with both sides participating in the evidentiary hearing. A heightened standard of proof, such as clear and convincing evidence, would unnecessarily restrict the State's ability to protect the public, and the offender's somewhat limited rights were adequately protected by a requirement that the State had to prove any classification by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the county's intervention was arguably proper under Wyo. R. Civ. P. 24(a), and the company did not cite authority argument that allowing intervention was reversible error. The court also found that the SBOE, the DOR and the county did not violate Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16-3-114(c) (2005) by making use of partial mill levies in the collection of ad valorem taxes on increased mineral values for 1980 to 1986. Further, the enactment of Wyo. Stat.

The only correct method for reporting production, under the circumstances of this case, was by well location. The court agreed that Wyo. Stat.

The court concluded that the SBOE's findings that the events triggering the dispute in this case occurred prior to the enactment of &sect; 39-2-201(j) were supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 14-3-105(a) was unconstitutional as applied to him. The supreme court disagreed. The record reflected that defendant engaged in clandestine efforts to video tape the victims in their bedroom in an attempt to obtain nude or partially nude images of them. He obtained and preserved those images. He continued to operate his surveillance system until it was discovered. The common sense of society could regard such acts as violative of the statute and a person of ordinary intelligence had sufficient notice that such conduct would be against the law. Defendant's attempts to mislead the investigating officer and dispose of the camera and video tapes provided evidentiary support indicating that he knew his conduct was unlawful. Therefore, the indecent liberties statute was not unconstitutionally applied to defendant and there was no error in the district court's denial of the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the State intentionally caused the loss of material and favorable trial testimony because officers threatened a potential defense witness, and that violated his constitutional rights to due process and compulsory process. The fact that an officer requested a polygraph examination, during which the witness claimed that his first statement was partially untrue, did not, ipso facto, prove otherwise. The nexus between the State's alleged conduct and the loss of material and favorable trial testimony was also tenuous. The record did not indicate that the witness was unwilling to testify at defendant's trial, that he intended to invoke his constitutional right not to testify, or that he was no longer available to the defense due to improper governmental conduct--he did not testify at the motion hearing and defense counsel obviously made a strategic decision not to call him as a trial witness. Therefore, it was unknown what the witness's trial testimony would have been had either party called him at trial.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-7-101(a)(iii)(D) (2005). Appellants initiated declaratory actions after appellees, the State and the city, threatened to shut down the games.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants claimed that the trial court's findings were erroneous and &sect; 6-7-101(a)(iii)(D) was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the trial court's findings were supported by evidence that showed the non-profit organizations shared their &quot;bingo&quot; profits with the for-profit manufacturer and that their electronic games were vastly different from the game of bingo in the exception; therefore, appellants' electronic &quot;bingo&quot; games were not being conducted by non-profit organizations and did not fall within the bingo exclusion provided in &sect; 6-7-101(a)(iii)(D) to the statutory ban. The court found that the trial court erred in finding that the electronic games were subject to manipulation where no evidence of actual manipulation was presented; however, the error was not prejudicial because other sufficient evidence supported the trial court's ultimate conclusion. The court rejected appellants' vagueness claim because &sect; 6-7-101 gave them adequate notice of what conduct was prohibited. Also, there was no evidence of selective prosecution because the mere fact that appellants got away with violating the statutes for years did not equate to arbitrary and discriminatory prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to attempted voluntary manslaughter, after two mistrials on the charge. He was sentenced to 18 to 20 years with credit for 788 days. Defendant failed to establish a violation of any of the three double jeopardy protections. He was never acquitted, or convicted, of attempted second degree murder, and he conceded he did not receive punishments for the same offense. He waived all nonjurisdictional defenses when he entered his unconditional nolo contendere plea. He challenged the sentencing procedure and sentence. His claim of error related to the victim impact statements offered by the victim, a State trooper. The trooper submitted both a written and an oral victim statement. Defendant contended the trial court erred in considering both statements and was unduly influenced by the trooper's input. By its terms, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-21-102(a)(vi) (2001) did not limit a victim's right to also make an oral statement to the court. Defendant failed to establish a violation of a clear and unequivocal rule of law.

The claims stemmed from the settlement of the driver's uninsured motorist (UM) claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was involved in a one car rollover while driving her grandparents' vehicle that was insured by the insurer. During the insurer's investigation, witnesses stated that another vehicle swerved into the passing lane, causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle. The court held that the insurer complied with the first requirement of the UM provision of the policy by concluding that if the witnesses were believed, the driver could be entitled to collect damages from the UM. And because the insurer offered and the driver accepted a settlement, summary judgment was proper on the breach of contract claim. The court also held that without the opportunity to present evidence concerning the underlying accident, the insurer would have had no defense to the claim that a reasonable insurer under the circumstances would have handled the claim differently. Also, evidence of the driver's marijuana use was properly admitted. While the district court erred in instructing that the insurer's duty to inform insureds of the extent of coverage was conditional, the error was not prejudicial because there was ample testimony by the insurer that it had that duty.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. Defendant arrived at the police station voluntarily early in the morning. After a couple of hours of questioning, he was given his Miranda warnings. Despite the fact that no officer had directly told defendant that he was no longer free to go, the situation had changed to such a degree that it must have been obvious to everyone, including defendant, that he could not leave. Not once, but twice, defendant approached an officer with questions as to what he should do. There was no suggestion in the record that any of the officers spoke to or questioned defendant after he requested counsel. In fact, his first attempt to initiate re-contact with the officers failed because they would not speak with him unless he signed a request for contact form, which he was reluctant to do. His refusal to speak to those detectives showed that he was aware that silence was an option.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-3-105(a) (2003), a felony, and was sentenced to two to five years in the Wyoming state penitentiary. He appealed the judgment and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, in his unconstitutional as-applied argument, defendant contended that the indecent liberties statute, as applied to the facts of his case, was unconstitutionally vague because the statutory language provided no notice that consensual intercourse with a 16 year old was criminal behavior because that conduct did not offend the third degree sexual assault statute. In Wyoming, sexual contact with a child under the age of 16 was felony third degree sexual assault pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-304(a)(i) (2003). Because the victim in the case at bar was 16 years old, sexual contact with her did not violate that statute. However, the Supreme Court of Wyoming had previously determined that extreme age differences between an adult and a minor over the age of 16 engaged in consensual sexual activity could still constitute indecent liberties in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-3-105(a). The consent of a minor was not a complete defense to the charge of taking indecent liberties. Defendant's factual situation presented nothing that had not previously been considered and found constitutional, and the court again held that the indecent liberties statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the landowners' monetary claims should have been dismissed for failure to comply either with the WGCA or Wyo. Const. art. 16, &sect; 7. The plan was properly adopted by the county as its individual land-use plan and not as a joint land use-plan with two cities; therefore, it did not need to meet the requirements of Wyoming Joint Powers Act (WJPA), Wyo.

Next, the landowners' right to procedural due process was not violated in the adoption process, and the plan was properly enforced through the county's zoning resolution. Also, the plan's conditional use permit standards were not unconstitutionally vague, and the plan and its conditional use permit system did not constitute an illegal restraint on land use.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was 83 years of age, was charged with aggravated vehicular homicide. After a plea agreement, which would have allowed for a suspended prison sentence, was rejected, he withdrew his first guilty plea. Then, after his request for a three-hour hearing on his motion for reconsideration of same was rejected, he entered a &quot;cold plea&quot; to the offense in the District Court of Natrona County, Wyoming. He then appealed the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original plea agreement also provided for supervised probation. However, the district court imposed a sentence of incarceration for 36 months to 72 months. The Wyoming Supreme Court held that upon defendant's second guilty plea, he waived of his right to appeal the district court's rejection of the earlier plea agreement, and of his right to appeal the limitation of a reconsideration hearing to 15 minutes. Defendant had made no suggestion that his second plea was anything but voluntary, and he did not contend that the district court's discretionary decisions concerning the plea agreement were jurisdictional in nature. Secondly, the supreme court rejected defendant's argument that the district court erred by refusing to even consider probation. The district court had stated that probation would have sent the wrong message to the public. It did not refuse to consider probation. Finally, the supreme court rejected defendant's argument that, in regard to deterrence, his sentence offended Wyo. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 due to his age. The latter provision spoke to the penal code, not to sentencing, and the record showed the district court exercised reasonable discretion in sentencing.</SPAN></P>

More than two years after the accident, the driver presented an amended claim that was personally signed and certified under penalty of perjury. The district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the driver sought review. The court determined that the driver did not present, during the mandatory two-year period of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-39-113(a) (2003), a notice of claim signed by the driver under penalty of perjury, as required by Wyo. Const. art. 16, &sect; 7. The driver's belated effort to cure that deficiency was ineffective because his cause of action ceased to exist when the statutory period expired. The presentment of a valid claim being jurisdictional, the district court was correct in determining that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claim. The court declined to apply the rule prospectively only. Because the court had no better jurisdiction than did the district court, dismissal was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The paternal grandparents argued that the trial court erred in severing their visitation rights. The supreme court disagreed. The adoption statutes extinguished all legal relationships between an adopted child and his or her biological family. The legislature's subsequent passage of the grandparent visitation statute,&nbsp;Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-7-101, that contained no statement, explicit or implicit, of an intention to create a general grandparent exception to that rule did not, through silence, create an ambiguity in that regard. Indeed, the legislature knew how to make an exception to the severing effect of adoption because it did so for stepparent adoptions. The paternal grandparents had no statutory right to continued visitation with their grandchild. Because the legislature did not provide that grandparent visitation rights survived adoption of a grandchild under the circumstances of the case, i.e. adoption by grandparents, such rights were limited and terminable without notice, and, therefore, did not rise to the magnitude of constitutionally protected liberty interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed violations of his constitutional rights, including that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that the inmate had failed to meet the test for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. He was unable to show that he suffered any prejudice from courtroom security measures, let alone that, absent those measures, he would not have been found guilty. Because the prosecutor's closing argument was not cause for reversal, appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the issue on direct appeal. Sufficient evidence was presented showing the inmate's participation in the concerted attack upon the shift command center and the murder of the guard and of the trio's attempt to scale the razor wire fencing surrounding the penitentiary. Even if the inmate's motion for judgment of acquittal been renewed after presentation of the defense evidence, it would have been denied. Accordingly, counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion that would not have been granted.

It only required that a person resign municipal employment prior to holding municipal office. The legislature did not intend the statute to include a resign-to-run qualification. Since the statute did not create a class of persons who must resign their employment before seeking election to municipal office, the statute was not unconstitutional on that ground.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district expelled appellees, two students, for one year for selling marijuana. The students were also adjudged delinquent. The District Court of Washakie County (Wyoming) ordered the school district to provide the students with a free and appropriate education during the period of expulsion, concluding that it had an obligation under the Wyoming Constitution to provide such an education. The constitutional question was reserved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the provisions of the Wyoming Constitution required a school district to provide an education to a lawfully expelled student. While moot, the Supreme Court of Wyoming found that the instant case fell within an exception to that doctrine and also concluded that strict scrutiny was the appropriate test. The school district asserted that it had a compelling interest in providing for the safety and welfare of its students and that it was that interest that the expulsions protected. The court agreed. The court held that the district's actions were the least onerous means of accomplishing that compelling interest, and the court did not agree that an alternate education had to be provided to lawfully expelled students. The fundamental right to an opportunity for an education did not guarantee that a student could not temporarily forfeit educational services through his own conduct. The term of the expulsions lasted for only one year. Thus, the students were not denied all educational opportunity. Following their suspension, it was their choice whether or not to return to school. Their temporary expulsion was narrowly tailored to fit the State's compelling interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On February 28, 2003, appellant homeowners filed a suit and a second notice of claim against appellee City claiming damages. An amended complaint was filed on March 11, 2003, alleging a violation of Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 33. The District Court of Albany County (Wyoming) granted the City's motion for summary judgment based on a statute of limitations argument regarding Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-39-114. The homeowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The single basis for the City's motion was the homeowners' admitted failure to file their complaint within the one-year limitation period set by the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-39-114. The Supreme Court of Wyoming resolved the interrelated issues of the instant case by first addressing the question of whether application of the period of limitations found in &sect; 1-39-114 to inverse condemnation actions was constitutional. The court held the statutory periods of limitation found in the WGCA applied to the homeowners' inverse condemnation cause of action as well as to their tort claims. The undisputed material facts showed that the homeowners' complaint was filed well beyond the one-year period set forth in Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-39-114, and was, therefore, time-barred. Having no justiciable case to bring before the district court, the homeowners had no standing to contest the constitutionality of various provisions of the WGCA. The conclusion that inverse condemnation claims were subject to the limitation periods found in the WGCA meant that the district court was correct in applying its statute of limitation analysis to all of the state law claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the district court was affirmed, and the matter was remanded to the district court for further proceedings concerning any other claim the homeowners might have stated.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the plain meaning of the term &quot;solicit&quot; was clear from its dictionary definitions and that defendant failed to present a cogent argument as to his claim that &sect; 14-3-104 was vague. The court rejected defendant's insufficient evidence claim, as the record established that he repeatedly asked the victim and her friend sexually suggestive questions and if they would consider engaging in sexual acts with him. Defendant also encouraged the girls to go behind a store so that police could not see them. The court held that, even if the trial court incorrectly defined &quot;solicit&quot; for the jury, defendant could not show he was prejudiced, as a reversal of his soliciting conviction would have no real effect, as the conviction for knowingly encouraging the victim would still stand. Testimony regarding defendant's sexual comments to another young girl were properly admitted under the &quot;course of conduct&quot; exception to the exclusionary rule set out in Wyo. R.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-4-303(b)(iii) (2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover agent, posing as a 15-year-old girl, made contact with defendant in an Internet chat room. Defendant forwarded a photograph of a preteen girl in a sexually explicit situation to the agent. Defendant also suggested that they meet and engage in sexual activity. Defendant was arrested at his home. During questioning, defendant admitted to previously having sexual contact with another 15-year-old girl whom he met in the chat room. The court held that &sect; 6-4-303 generally was not facially overbroad. One of the definitions of child pornography in &sect; 6-4-303 included the use of a real child. The statute therefore could be enforced, even if all other definitional sections were severed from the statute. The court found no support for defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant did not claim that he would not have accepted the plea agreement had his counsel's performance been different, let alone that the ultimate outcome of the proceedings would have been more favorable to him.

The appellate court determined that Apprendi did not apply where the enhancer was, by terms of the applicable statute, a &quot;sentencing factor&quot; and not an &quot;essential element of the crime,&quot; and applied so as to extend the minimum sentence but did not enlarge the applicable maximum sentence. A contemporaneous conviction was one as being on the same footing as a prior conviction. To the extent that two other U.S. Supreme Court cases had any application to the circumstances of defendant's case, the sentences imposed on defendant also fully satisfied those standards. Because the constitutional principles did not apply to defendant's case, the appellate court did not need not determine whether or not they might apply retroactively to defendant's sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, at age 18, admitted having sexual intercourse with a 14-year-old girl. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 14-3-105, contending that the statute was vague and that it violated due process and equal protection rights in allowing arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court held that because of the age difference between defendant and the victim, and their relative maturity levels, it could not be concluded that defendant showed that a fundamental right had been violated. Further, while &sect; 14-3-105 did not specifically define &quot;immodest, immoral, or indecent liberties,&quot; courts had previously held that the statute prohibited sexual intercourse between adult males and minor females and that the previous holdings provided proper notice that the acts defendant took with the victim were illegal. Therefore, &sect; 14-3-105 was not vague as applied to the facts of this case. The court held, however, that the jury was not appropriately instructed to consider the totality of circumstances in determining whether or not defendant's actions fell within &quot;immodest,&quot; &quot;immoral,&quot; or &quot;indecent,&quot; and a special verdict form should have been used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the recent statutory amendment adding life imprisonment without parole as a penalty for first degree murder violated due process and that insufficient evidence supported his convictions. The Supreme Court of Wyoming held that the life imprisonment without parole provision of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-101(c) (2003) did not violate due process. Defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutional because: (1) it failed to guide the trial court in sentencing and denied the supreme court the ability to review the trial court's imposition of life imprisonment without parole; (2) it allowed the trial court instead of a jury to sentence defendant to life imprisonment without parole in violation of case law; and (3) the State did not give notice to defendant that it was seeking life imprisonment without parole until just before the sentencing hearing. Notice and opportunity to be heard were provided to defendant when, before trial, the State amended the information to incorporate the penalty of life without parole. Also, after trial, it filed a notice of intent to seek that penalty with adequate time for defendant to prepare for his sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer challenged the trial court judgment as to the validity of the NCZR, which provided that no sales of land within a &quot;major land subdivision&quot; could occur until a plan was approved by the county. The developer had contracted to purchase land and then began selling 40-acre parcels without first obtaining plan approval. The developer claimed that the NCZR was invalid because it exceeded the county's authority to regulate the subdivision of land. The court held that the developer had standing to challenge the validity of the NCZR because even though it was not the record owner, it had a &quot;tangible interest&quot; pursuant to its purchase contract and because the county intended to enforce the NCZR. The court held that the only authority granted to the county to regulate the division of land was the RESA, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18-5-301 et seq., and that under the specific terms of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18-5-303(b) (2003), counties were not authorized to require county approval for the subdivision of land into parcels greater than 35 acres. The court noted that Wyo. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment that held the developer lacked standing to challenge the validity of the NCZR and that the NCZR was a proper exercise of the county's authority to regulate the subdivision of land.

Appellants sought a declaration that the County did not have the right to convey to the utility the right to use a public road right-of-way easement and to enjoin any other transfers to a non-public entity or for any non-public use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants granted the County a right of way easement for a portion of a road crossing their lands. Appellants filed suit when the county later entered into right-of-way use agreement with a private utility company, which would allow the utility to build a sewer line along the road in order to connect a golf course to the town system. The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings for the County. On appeal, the court concluded that the use agreement was in the public's interest, that it fit within the scope and purpose of appellants' easements, and that the County was within its rights to enter into the agreement with the utility. The court held that the right to use a public road easement, whether or not such easement was considered to be a commercial easement in gross, was transferable and divisible, so long as the transfer was in the public interest and did not increase the burden on the servient estates. The court held that the right was not dependent upon language of the easement grant, but was, as a matter of law, part of the purpose of a public road easement and was not defeated solely because the sewer line was to be constructed by a private entity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After judgment entered against the former president for corporate funds theft, his successor signed a satisfaction of the judgment for no consideration. The supreme court held the corporation's attorney was not disqualified, as his withdrawal or substitution was not sought. As the corporation sought to enforce its judgment against the former president, and the successor may have disposed of corporate assets, it was up to the board of directors to replace the corporate attorney. If the president could sign a release of judgment, it could be set aside for lack of consideration. As the release was a conflict of interest benefitting the former president and no exceptions in Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-16-831 applied, it was voidable by the corporation. Given the former president's misappropriation and animosity to other shareholders, his derivative suit against other directors was properly dismissed, as he did not represent shareholder interests. Paying taxes by a trust of which the former president was a beneficiary, which had not occurred, was a pre-condition to distributing trust assets, so his motion to distribute the trust's real estate was denied.</SPAN></P>

His plea was intelligent, knowing, and voluntary, and he understood its consequences.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming) rejected affirmative defenses in an action by plaintiffs, two incumbent state legislators and two electors. The court certified questions to the court to determine whether the term limit law for state elected officials, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-5-103 (2003), was constitutional and enforceable and whether the action was barred by the doctrine of laches or by a statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wyoming voters approved an initiative that limited the number of terms of office that could be served by certain of its elected officials. The court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting laches because it was not unreasonable for plaintiffs to wait to bring the action until it appeared unavoidable. The 30-day period of limitations of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-24-122 did not apply to substantive constitutional challenges to particular laws adopted via initiative. The legislators' causes of action did not accrue until they were actually faced with the reality of being foreclosed from seeking re-election, and the electors' causes of action did not accrue until they were actually faced with the reality of not being able to vote for their chosen candidates. The inherent and reserved powers of the people did not include the right to enact via the initiative a law that could not be enacted by the legislature. Under Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3, no law, whether enacted by the legislature through the legislative process or by the people through the initiative process, could condition political rights and privileges upon a circumstance or condition such as incumbency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions by holding that the term limit law, as it applied to candidates for state legislature, whether adopted by initiative or legislative action, was unconstitutional and unenforceable. The reserved powers of the people under the Wyoming Constitution did not include the right to alter the government by initiative or by statute with regard to the time period any one person could hold a state legislative office.</SPAN></P>

The outfitter filed a petition for review and a complaint for declaratory judgment in the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming). The district court affirmed the Board on the issues raised in the outfitter's petition. The outfitter appealed the district court's adverse rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The outfitter contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the Board's findings regarding the outfitter's violations. The court stated that the record was not sufficient for the Board to conclude that the outfitter intentionally, knowingly, or voluntarily, as distinguished from accidentally, allowed or permitted livestock to remain near the camp water supply and to leave excrement near the water supply. However, the court affirmed the district court's judgment, finding that the evidence was sufficient to show that the outfitter violated a significant federal law in failing properly to dispose of a dead mule carcass. The court stated that, even according to the outfitter's testimony, the mule carcass was well short of the distance required by 36 C.F.R. &sect; 261.50. Additionally, the evidence showed that the outfitter willfully endangered a client's health and safety by leaving or abandoning her in the wilderness in order to get his livestock back to the trailhead and never returning to check on her well-being or progress. Therefore, The Board's decision to revoke the outfitter's license was warranted pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-2-416 (2003).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the Laramie County District Court (Wyoming) with aggravated assault and battery. After three days of trial before a jury, the court declared a mistrial and dismissed with prejudice the charges against defendant on the ground that the six-month deadline for speedy trial had passed and a second trial on re-filed charges would further exceed the deadline. The State filed a petition for review challenging the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that, under the circumstances of the case, it could utilize a petition for review to challenge the district court's order of dismissal with prejudice. The supreme court agreed. The question of whether the prosecution intended to goad the defense into moving for a mistrial was not decided. Defendant moved for a mistrial based upon the prosecution's alleged violation of the ethical rules and his constitutional right to counsel. The district court concluded that the prosecution's conduct provided grounds for a mistrial, granted the defense motion, and dismissed the case with prejudice on the basis of speedy trial concerns. The distinctive feature of the case was that the double jeopardy issue was not decided by the district court and, given the procedural posture of the case, could not be decided unless and until the State re-filed the charges against defendant. Therefore, the writ of review was appropriate. The State had no other adequate remedy, the issues presented were of constitutional magnitude and public importance, and it was not established that allowing the writ would place defendant in jeopardy for a second time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that one of the school districts had the authority to use the bond proceeds from the bond election to fund an auditorium and other local enhancements under construction in that school district. Likewise, the other school district was authorized to sell the bonds authorized by the election and proceed with its plans to construct the a high school with an auditorium and other proposed local enhancements. The supreme court further held that the challengers were not barred from raising issues related to the use of the funds. However, neither the prior applicable case decisions, nor the revised statutes, which became effective after the bond elections, had any effect upon the school districts' authority to use the proceeds from the sale of bonds authorized by the elections.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 15-1-409(a) (2003), and even if they had standing, they did not timely file their complaint in accordance with &sect; 15-1-409(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners filed this action seeking to challenge an annexation.

The court found that the landowners did have standing to challenge the annexation pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-37-103 (2003) of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act because they had an interest in the annexation, given that the annexation brought the landowners' property under the city's control, and the annexation facilitated the annexation of the landowners' property. Although the landowners were not included in Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15-1-409 (2003) by virtue of the definition of landowner under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15-1-401(a)(ii) (2003), this exclusion did not necessarily mean that they were precluded from bringing their action. The court found nothing in Wyo. Stat.

The court held that aggrieved parties were entitled to challenge the validity of an annexation within the statute of limitations applicable to civil actions.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the Federal Communication Commission had preempted &sect; 37-15-201(c) pursuant to the provisions of &sect; 253(b) of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996. The court held that PSC properly applied &sect; 37-15-201(b) and appropriately concluded that &sect; 37-2-205(a) was not applicable. The legislature intended that &sect; 37-2-205(a) would apply to situations wherein a utility contemplated construction or the extension of a line, plant, or system. In this instance, appellee merely requested that it be allowed to provide additional concurrent services with the current local exchange carriers on those lines that already existed in the area. The court stated that the legislature intended &sect; 37-15-201 to apply to the situation at hand.

After 50 minutes, defendant was found guilty of one count of kidnapping, in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-2-201(a)(iii), (b)(i) and (c) (LexisNexis 2003). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed error in the substitution of an alternate juror after deliberation commenced. The Supreme Court of Wyoming concluded that the substitution of the alternate juror after deliberations had begun constituted prejudicial error. The plain language of Wyo. R. Crim. P. 24(e) did not permit the substitution of an alternate juror for a regular juror once deliberations commenced. The substitution of an alternate juror in those circumstances raised a presumption of prejudice to a defendant that could only be rebutted upon a showing that adequate procedural safeguards were undertaken by the trial court. In the case at bar, adequate procedural safeguards were not taken. The reconstituted jury was not instructed to begin deliberations anew. Nor was there an inquiry as to whether or not the remaining regular jurors could have set aside their previous deliberations and any opinions formed during those deliberations. That failure raised the potential for prejudice evidenced by the fact that the original jury deliberated the previous afternoon without reaching a verdict, but managed to reach a verdict with the participation of the alternate juror in less than an hour.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former inmate was convicted and sentenced in 1997. He appealed his conviction and sentence, which the court upheld. In 2002, the former inmate filed the instant petition under his criminal case caption, alleging defects in his arrest warrant and search procedures. He also alleged that his conviction was void because the county court commissioners who presided over his preliminary hearing did not have written oaths of office on file. The issues were not raised in the previous appeal. The district court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court held that the district court had no continuing authority to act in the former inmate's case once his conviction became final because of the exercise of the right of appeal. The inmate's attempt to bring his claim as a civil proceeding did not alter that fact. Even if the inmate's petition was construed as a motion for a new trial or for arrest of judgment, it was three or five years too late, respectively. He was likewise too late under Wyo. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A motorist was killed in an automobile accident that was allegedly caused by a drunk driver, and the executor of the motorist's estate and the motorist's survivors sued a restaurant corporation that operated a restaurant and bar where the drunk driver was served alcohol before the accident, asserting claims for wrongful death and negligence. The deceased motorist's executor and survivors claimed that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-8-301 (2001) violated their right under Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8 to access to the courts and their right to equal protection of the law, because it created a cause of action against persons who illegally sold or served alcohol to people who caused injuries to third parties, but did not create the same cause of action against persons who legally sold or served alcohol to people who caused injuries to third parties. The state supreme court held that &sect; 12-8-301 did not infringe upon the fundamental right of access to the courts declared in Wyo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank, along with respondent citizens and education association, sought a declaration that the Wyoming Constitution prohibited the exchange of state school lands without public auction and, consequently, the statutes and administrative rules which authorized such exchanges were void as unconstitutional. The question reserved for the Wyoming Supreme Court was whether the exchange of school lands without public auction violated Wyo. Const. art. 18, &sect;&sect; 1 and 3. The supreme court found that the constitution prohibited the sale of school lands without a public auction. However, the framers did not include a specific prohibition against the exchange of school lands without a public auction. The court refused to read such a requirement into the constitution and, therefore, concluded that the statutes and regulations authorizing the exchange of school lands did not violate the constitution. In the absence of a clear constitutional prohibition of exchanges without auction, the legislature properly exercised its power to adopt statutes which specify the circumstances in which such exchanges are allowed and authorized the adoption of administrative regulations regarding the same.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 36-5-105 (2001), the preferential right-to-renew statute, the Laramie County District Court, Wyoming, granted appellee intervenor defendants' motion to dismiss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal in this case raised the following issues: (1) whether appellant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 36-5-105(a) and (e) (2001) governing the leasing of school lands; (2) whether the Wyoming Act of Admission, the Wyoming Constitution, or Wyoming statutes established a trust with respect to the lands which the United States gave to Wyoming for the support of the common schools; and (3) if the state school lands were in fact held in trust, whether the statutory right of a previous lessee to renew a lease of state school lands violated the State's management duties with respect to those lands. The instant court concluded that appellant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the right-to-renew statute. The school lands were subject to neither a federal trust nor a state constitutional trust, but rather to a legislatively-created statutory trust. Appellant failed to prove that the statute violated any constitutional or fiduciary restraints on the State's management of the school lands. Appellant's evidence did not necessarily indicate that the lease at issue was undervalued when granted by the Board of Land Commissioners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that the trial court erred by granting the supervisors' motion for summary judgment. The supreme court agreed. The trial court viewed the issues too narrowly and failed to address the evidence which created questions of fact concerning the supervisors' knowledge of the general risks posed by the machine. In the supervisors' depositions, they both, albeit reluctantly, acknowledged the extremely hazardous nature of work done in and around the energized shuttle belt machine and their awareness of numerous ways a worker could have been injured through amputation of body parts or even loss of life. However, they denied knowing the sheave wheel, which severed the employee's foot, was unguarded. They also denied that they had knowledge of any company policy requiring the shuttle belt to be locked out under the circumstances which existed on the night of the accident. Therefore, the trial court erred by granting the supervisors' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Washakie County (Wyoming), after a jury trial, convicted defendant of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-101(a) capital murder, for murdering three victims during a robbery at a bar, and sentenced him to death under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-102. Defendant appealed in accordance with Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-103(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's counsel was not ineffective for admitting that defendant shot the victims in the back of their heads to get a second-degree, rather than first-degree, murder conviction, in light of defendant's several confessions, or for not arguing the defense of mental incapacity. There was sufficient premeditation, planning activity, even though defendant suffered from brain injuries and was drunk, based on confessions and manner of killing. The death penalty statute was a weighing statute; the supreme court suggested proper weighing instructions, that the limited statutory aggravating circumstances had to &quot;outweigh&quot; mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt to impose the death penalty, for the sentencing retrial. The scope and required consideration of mitigating circumstances was defined. Victim impact statements were not admissible. The aggravating circumstances of: (1) &quot;especially atrocious and cruel, being unnecessarily torturous to the victim&quot; was ambiguous, was improperly instructed, and was not supported by the evidence; and (2) &quot;knowingly created a great risk of death to two or more persons&quot; was not supported by the evidence--only intended victims were killed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court: (1) affirmed the conviction; (2) reversed the death sentence; (3) determined it would not decide whether a different sentence would have occurred if the improper aggravating circumstances had not been present during the jury's weighing process; and (4) remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Hot Springs County (Wyoming), after a jury trial, convicted defendant of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-101(a) capital murder, for participating with two other prisoners (who received life sentences) in the murder of a prison guard during their prison escape attempt, and sentenced defendant to death, pursuant to Wyo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's statement to investigators satisfied the Bradshaw voluntariness test and was properly not suppressed; he was informed of his rights, and, after requesting counsel, he initiated a conversation with investigators in which he made incriminating statements, and, by doing so, he waived his rights to silence and representation. The death penalty statute and general victim impact statute did not authorize the introduction of victim impact evidence during capital sentencing, but the error was harmless under Booth, Gathers, and Payne standards. The jurors were properly death qualified in voir dire under Witt and Morgan to identify those jurors at both ends of the spectrum and eliminate jurors who would always vote for the death penalty. The prosecutor did not improperly cooperate with the investigators. The trial court's use of a death penalty law clerk was not error. The death sentence was proportionate under Tyson's application of the Enmund culpability standard; evidence indicated that defendant, at the least, participated in the murder and acted with reckless indifference to human life. Defendant's record was not supplemented by co-defendants' trials' records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court: (1) determined that neither the rulings and orders appealed by defendant nor its independent search of the record disclosed any reversible error; (2) affirmed the trial court's judgment and death sentence; and (3) remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purposes to vacate the suspension of the sentence of death and to set a specific date for execution of that sentence.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of Teton County (Wyoming) granted summary judgment to appellee homeowner on his counterclaim alleging the unconstitutionality of the regulation.

The Board filed the instant action for demolition of the expansion and for other relief. The homeowner counterclaimed that the regulation deprived him of due process rights and filed a separate action for declaratory and injunctive relief. After consolidating the matters, the trial court granted summary judgment to the homeowner, finding that the regulation was unconstitutional as applied. On appeal, the court reversed. The court agreed that the regulation was not unconstitutional facially but further held that it was constitutional as applied, too. The court held that the Board had authority under Wyo. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hunter was prosecuted for allegedly violating Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-3-305(b) (LexisNexis 2001) by entering private property to hunt without the landowner's permission. He entered a conditional guilty plea and appealed. Thereafter, the hunter filed this declaratory judgment action and claimed that certain hunting regulations were void, as the Department allegedly did not comply with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-3-101 to -115 (LexisNexis 2001), in incorporating a hunting publication into the rules and regulations. The trial court dismissed the action on the grounds that the hunter was not adversely affected in fact. The court affirmed, but on different grounds. The court found that the hunter was affected in fact by the rules, as he held a hunting license and was criminally cited for hunting in violation of the rules. However, the certified questions from the criminal case and the declaratory judgment action raised the same issues. There was no other purpose behind the declaratory judgment action except to attempt to obtain a final judgment from a different forum that was binding on the criminal court, which the court refused to allow.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held defendant was not prejudiced when the prosecutor hired defense counsel, as counsel's efforts to ensure no prejudice outbalanced a lack of attention to the issue. Prosecuting defendant for felony murder under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-101 (Michie 1994), for abusing a child under 16, rather than prosecuting him for child abuse, under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-503 (Michie Supp. 1995), did not violate equal protection under Wyo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 or 34, as the provision for a first degree murder prosecution for causing the death of a child under 16 gave fair notice of the potential penalty of life in prison or execution. Defendant's life sentence was not cruel or unusual, under Wyo. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The trial court's instructions on the required intent were adequate, and the evidence allowed defendant's conviction both under the theory that his acts were intentional and that they were reckless. His absence when the jury was instructed in response to a question was not reversible error. The prosecutor's comments talking about defendant's statements, rather than silence, did not violate his right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court of Wyoming held that under the totality of the circumstances, giving due deference to the issuing judicial officer's determinations, and recognizing defendant's burden of proving a violation of his constitutional rights by a preponderance of the evidence, the affidavit presented probable cause to issue the search warrant, with or without the thermal imaging information. The issuing judge learned from the affidavit of a trained and experienced law enforcement officer that juvenile suspects in a criminal case had, against their penal interests, admitted an attempt to steal marijuana from defendant. They identified the location, identified the individual buildings on the premises, and told of the series of locks on the trailer in which the grow operation was housed. The device was not used on defendant's residence and he did not meet his burden of proving that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 30-5-303(b) (LexisNexis 2001) of the Wyoming Royalty Payment Act (WRPA) from defendants, oil and gas producers, in the Third Judicial District Court of Lincoln County, Wyoming. The district court, pursuant to Wyo. R. App. P. 11, presented two certified questions concerning the jurisdictional provision contained in the WRPA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified questions asked: (1) Did Wyo. Stat. &sect; 30-5-303(b) confer exclusive jurisdiction over claims under the WRPA in the district court for the county in which a well producing oil, gas, or related hydrocarbons was located; and (2) if so, could Wyo. R. Civ. P. 23 override the grant of exclusive jurisdiction such that a district court might, in the context of a class action, adjudicate WRPA claims relating to wells not located in the county in which the class action was pending? The oil and gas producers contended the statute limited claims under the WRPA to the district court for the county in which the well was located. The royalty owners contended the statute allowed for suits to be brought where a (meaning &quot;any&quot;) well was located, not just where the well was located. The court held that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-5-303(b) was unambiguous, and that the WRPA did not confer exclusive jurisdiction over claims brought under it in the district court for the county in which a particular well was located, but allowed such claims to be brought in the district court of any county in which a well was located. In view of its answer, the court found that question number two was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the first certified question &quot;no&quot; and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings consonant with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

The district court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing, and defendant appealed, raising several ineffective assistance issues and challenging the district court's denial of an evidentiary hearing. The State contended that defendant's appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in the district court to entertain the motion. The court held that its own jurisdiction in the matter was no greater than the district court's, and that even though Wyo. R. Crim. P. 32(d) did not set a time limit for filing a motion to withdraw a guilty plea with the district court after sentencing, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain defendant's motion to withdraw guilty pleas under Wyo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, owners of residential lots in a recreational subdivision and members of appellee subdivision homeowners association, a non-profit corporation, appealed from the grant of summary judgment to the association by the District Court of Lincoln County, Wyoming, declaring that a culinary water fee imposed by the association was authorized, and from the district court's order imposing sanctions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a previous action between the same parties, the appellate court determined the power and authority of the association to collect and enforce assessments and fees upon its members. The instant declaratory judgment action arose out of the association's imposition of a culinary water fee upon the homeowners. The district court decided that the culinary water fee was different from the fee at issue in the previous litigation, and that the contract between the parties, including Wyoming non-profit corporation statutes, authorized the association to impose the culinary water fee. On appeal, it was uncontested that the culinary water system was part of the &quot;common area&quot; maintained by the association. The appellate court found that res judicata applied, and, under the contract between the parties as previously construed, consisting of the declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions, by-laws, and articles of incorporation, the fee was in excess of the maximum allowable under the applicable covenants, absent an affirmative vote of the homeowners. The court also found no abuse of discretion in the imposition of a nonmonetary sanction by the district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's order imposing a nonmonetary sanction, vacated the district court's entry of summary judgment for the association allowing imposition of the culinary water fee in question, ordered summary judgment entered in favor of the homeowners, and remanded for other proceedings not inconsistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The videotape was offered as a prior consistent statement. Its admission was error, as it was not a statement under Wyo. R.

The court also found no error, or harmless error, in the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and held that defense counsel was not ineffective in failing to file a motion to suppress evidence because facts learned during the officer's initial community caretaker function contact led him to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant contended inter alia that the State conducted illegal searches of a duffel bag and his wallet and that the trial court erred by failing to suppress the evidence seized as a result of those searches. The court disagreed, finding that by unequivocally denying ownership of the duffel bag, defendant had abandoned any expectation of privacy in it, and therefore lacked standing to challenge the search. The court also found the officer's warrantless search of the duffel bag was valid because the officers reasonably believed the owners of the residence where the bag was found had authority to consent to the search of their home and belongings. The court affirmed as well the trial court's decision admitting the fruits of the search of defendant's wallet. Even though, when arrested, defendant took the wallet from his pocket and placed it on the table in front of him, the wallet was still within defendant's immediate area and the search was a valid search incident to arrest. The court did remove from defendant's sentence, however, the trial court's recommendation that, as a condition of release, defendant be required to register as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified defendant's sentence to remove the recommendation that he be required to register as a sex offender, and affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Even before their daughter's death, the Wyoming Department of Family Services placed the subject child with her maternal grandfather and step-grandmother. The child's father came to Wyoming before the mother's death, and the department pursued many reunification plans with him, but he never agreed to meet the support conditions they contained. Over an eight-year period, the child demonstrated anxiety over the two-hour visitations with her father, during which he spoke abusively of her grandparents and social services personnel. Under these circumstances, the high court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's grant of the grandparents' adoption petition without parental consent, under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-22-110 (LexisNexis 2001), holding that the father had no right to a jury trial in such a proceeding. The fact that the grandparents' counsel was a part-time circuit court magistrate did not result in a conflict of interest, as Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5-3-312 (LexisNexis 2001) did not forbid it. Finally, substantial evidence underlay the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action, defendant brewery appealed an order of the Teton County District Court (Wyoming) granting summary judgment to plaintiff town, which contended that the brewery abandoned a fee in-lieu-of parking choice by not adopting it initially in 1993, or within 12 months of issuance of a building permit, and that the brewery had abandoned an off-site choice by not renewing its parking lease for 12 months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues in this case were whether: (1) as part of a non-conforming use, the brewery had a vested right to pay a fee in-lieu-of providing off street parking for its restaurant and micro-brewery; (2) the right, if one existed, was abandoned; and (3) application of the town's present parking regulations to the brewery's property was a reasonable exercise of police power. The town argued that because the brewery chose a combination of on-site parking and off-site leased parking, the brewery's right to pay a fee in-lieu-of providing on-site parking was not grandfathered as part of its non-conforming use. The brewery argued that what was grandfathered was the option available under the old zoning code, not just the one choice of off-site leased parking. The court held that the only reasonable interpretation of the zoning ordinances was that all the choices under the parking option remained available to the brewery as part of its non-conforming use. It would have violated Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15-1-601(d)(iv) (LexisNexis 2001) to declare that the parking options were no longer available to the brewery; such a result would have rendered valueless its substantial business investment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision was reversed, and the case was remanded with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of the brewery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land owner contended that, by state statutory definition, division of a previously subdivided tract into three parcels was the creation of a new subdivision, which could not be accomplished without proceeding under those statutes and ordinances governing the creation of a new subdivision. He also contended that the municipality's failure to notify a party holding a certificate of sale violated the ordinance's provision requiring notice to property owners of record within 140 feet, excluding streets, from the parcel, and that this failure required reversal of approval. The appellate court held that the town acted in accord with all governing law. The town council approved a re-subdivision, and, generally, that action did fall under the definition of a subdivision unless the statute provided otherwise. The statute did not provide further governing law regarding the process to be followed in creating a subdivision; that law was provided by the town's municipal ordinances, which provided for an abbreviated procedure for a re-subdivision that had already been subjected to those procedures applicable to a new subdivision.</SPAN></P>

The district court certified the matter to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Property owner purchased a lot with the intent of building a home on a ridge that ran through the lot, so as to capture spectacular views available from the ridgeline. Preliminary informal inquiries with the local planning personnel led him to believe he could build such a home. The board of commissioners denied his application for the grading permit, having determined that other siting alternatives existed for the location of a residence on the owner's lot that would not result in the residence penetrating the skyline on a particular butte. The supreme court held that it was appropriate for the board to apply its skylining regulations to the property owner's grading permit, because it was appropriate and sensible to determine before the driveway was cut whether the building site it would have led to was acceptable. However, the supreme court found that it was unable to conduct any meaningful review of the order issued by the board, because the record was incomplete, sketchy, and even devoid of essential facts, the board having failed to follow the procedures for a contested case mandated by Wyo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant coal company challenged the department of revenue's valuation of its coal production for ad valorem and severance tax purposes and contended that the bonus it paid when it purchased the federal coal lease was the same as a royalty and should have been treated as such in the application of the proportionate profits calculation. The company's petition for review was certified by the District Court of Campbell County (Wyoming).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the alternative, the taxpayer argued the bonus was an indirect, rather than a direct, mining cost under the statute. The supreme court held that a lease bonus was not a royalty, nor was it a direct mining cost, as contemplated by the statute and regulations. The taxpayer successfully bid on a federal coal lease by offering $ 86,987,765 in bonus payments. The lease also required payment of a 12 1/2 percent royalty on any production. The federal regulations defined bonus as the value in excess of the rentals and royalties that accrued to the United States because of coal resource ownership that was paid as part of the consideration for receiving a lease. 43 C.F.R. &sect; 3400.0-5(c) (2000). The parties did not identify a method to allocate the bonus payment over all the operations. Given the character of the bonus payment and the statutory definition of the applicable terms, the supreme court concluded the legislature must have intended for a bonus payment to be treated as an indirect cost benefiting the entire operation. A bonus payment was not in and of itself a property interest but instead reflected the sale price for the sale of certain governmental property to a private entity.</SPAN></P>

According to defendant, the State did not prove that she exercised dominion and control over, or &quot;possessed,&quot; a water cooler, its contents, or the scales seized from a vehicle in which she was a passenger. The instant court concluded that the facts of the case provided sufficient indicia of possession that a jury could reasonably infer that defendant &quot;possessed&quot; the contraband. The totality of the circumstances and accompanying inferences, including the nature of defendant's association with the driver and the vehicle, her fingerprints, the stains observed on the scales, defendant's hands, and a towel retrieved from defendant's belongings, in addition to defendant's statements and the evidence contained in her possessions, established a direct nexus between defendant, the water cooler and its contents, and the other items that comprised the clandestine laboratory operation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the District Court of Campbell County (Wyoming) to two counts of sexual assault and was initially sentenced to consecutive terms of not less than 12 years nor more than 15 years. He appealed, claiming, inter alia, his sentence for one of the counts was illegal, as there was insufficient evidence that the crime occurred after July 1, 1997, when the maximum sentence was increased.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Wyoming held, inter alia, that to obtain a conviction for sexual assault in the third degree, the state needed only to prove the elements of the crime set out in Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-304(a)(i); e.g., defendant committed sexual assault, as defined by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-301(a)(v), by inflicting sexual intrusion on the victim who was under the age of sixteen years and the defendant was more than four years older. The specific date of the assault was not relevant to whether or not the act constituted a crime. The state met its burden of alleging a general time frame within which the crime was committed in order to provide the defendant adequate notice and due process. Defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of third-degree sexual assault on the victim, admitting the crime occurred at anytime between the dates of October 4, 1996, through December 31, 1998, a time frame that extended over a year and a half beyond the July 1, 1997, effective date of the new sentencing statute. The sentence was proper given the guilty plea on the factual basis, which included a time frame long after the July 1, 1997, effective date of the amended sentencing statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court regarding the portion of the corrected sentencing order, which removed credit for presentence confinement as to Count V, was reversed and remanded, and the judgment was affirmed in all other regards.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The quantity of marijuana possessed by the defendant standing alone allowed the inference that he possessed it with intent beyond that of personal consumption. The officer's corroboration of the confidential informant's statements regarding where the defendant got his marijuana, the controlled buy that took place on the basis of the confidential informant's information, and the officer's general statement that on five occasions, when he was following up the confidential informant's information, he found the confidential informant to be reliable and truthful, provided a basis for the judicial issuing officer to conclude that the confidential informant was a reliable and credible source of information. Thirty separate transactions with the same confidential informant occurring over a period of time, a subsequent controlled buy, and averments by a credible and reliable source sufficiently established that the defendant's trafficking activity was lengthy and continuous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant consented to a search of his vehicle from which the sheriff seized a scale, tubing, acid, iodine, phosphorus, solvent, methamphetamine, and other materials used in the synthesis of methamphetamine. On appeal he alleged the statute was so vague so as to deprive a person of fair notice of the prohibited conduct. The supreme court noted that Wyo. Stat. Ann.  &sect;35-7-1059(a)(ii) was not so deficient that it set forth no standard of conduct at all. The language was such that a person of ordinary intelligence could read the statute and comprehend that it would be unlawful to possess and transport a pipe with methamphetamine residue and other materials commonly associated with the manufacture of methamphetamine. Therefore the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Finally, the State's failure to return to defendant certain seized items not associated with drug manufacture did not go to the whole consideration of the agreement, where defendant in fact received his vehicle and most of his property. Thus, defendant suffered no manifest injustice or a substantial breach of the plea agreement sufficient to allow for the withdrawal of his plea.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court held, inter alia, that: (1) the State was responsible for funding capital construction of facilities to the level deemed adequate by state standards; (2) the legislature was in control of the ultimate amount of spending, as it exercised its responsibility of review and oversight of specific projects proposed by local school districts; (3) local school districts could have supplied revenue in excess of legislative spending; and (4) local bonded indebtedness was no longer required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant outfitter's license was revoked by appellee state board of outfitters and guides. The outfitter filed a combined petition for review and complaint for declaratory judgment with the District Court of Park County (Wyoming), which certified the case to the state's highest court, pursuant to Wyo. R. App. P. 12.09.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The outfitter was licensed by the board, which sought sanctions based on various complaints it received. Included was an allegation he acted unethically and dishonorably with his clients, who were endangered. In a written response to a dissatisfied client, the outfitter used profanity, and suggested a fist fight. Although the board used this as a reason to revoke his license, the highest court found the letter did not endanger the client when he received it in another state, and the court could not find any statute or regulation that clearly permitted the board to punish the outfitter for this conduct. In reversing the board, the court also found insufficient findings of fact with regard to other alleged misconduct. Although the board's appeal brief set forth additional facts from within the record, the court found that appellate briefing was not the place to articulate sufficient findings of fact, and it was not the court's duty to analyze and assess evidence presented to determine the weight to be given to the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded with instructions to enter a judgment vacating the order of the board and remanding the proceedings to the board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a married couple, filed suit against defendant bar, city, police chief, and three officers. The District Court of Natrona County, Wyoming, dismissed, inter alia, a negligent serving of alcohol claim. On the remaining negligence issues, a jury found the wife fifty percent at fault, the bar zero percent, and divided the rest between the officers. The court awarded the statutory maximum of $ 250,000. The officers and couple appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife passed out while at the bar, and fell from her barstool to the floor. The bar owner and the three officers moved her into a police car to transport her to the hospital. When she arrived, she had suffered a broken neck. Although the couple claimed Wyo. Stat. Ann.  &sect;&sect; 1-39-118(a) and 12-8-301(a) (LexisNexis 2001), involving the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act and dram shop liability/immunity, respectively, were unconstitutional, they failed to raise the constitutional claims at the trial court level, so the state supreme court did not entertain those challenges on appeal. The court held that there clearly was sufficient evidence to justify a jury's finding that the bar was not at fault for the wife's injuries, contrary to the officers' contentions. As to the propriety of the dram shop jury instruction given, the couple's counsel repeatedly referred to the negligent serving of alcohol, although that claim had been dismissed. Closing arguments did not mislead the jury regarding the instruction, the jury did not request a re-reading, and other instructions properly stated the law, therefore there was no prejudice so it was not reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's judgment was affirmed in all respects.</SPAN></P>

The Wyoming Supreme Court held that the trial court had not erred as: (1) in the context of the case, &quot;knowingly&quot; had no technical meaning under the law which was different from its ordinary meaning, and the trial court was not required to define it; (2) it was not necessary that the child's private parts be subjected to the misconduct, and some acts, which may not be indecent in themselves, may be made so by words and circumstances; and (3) the mother was available to the defense by way of subpoena, and there was nothing in the record by way of an offer of proof that suggested that that line of questioning would have produced any admissible evidence for the defense.</SPAN></P>

The issues raised on appeal as to the constitutionality of the clandestine laboratory operations statutes were not raised before the trial court. The Supreme Court declined to consider those statutes under these circumstances, where there was no suggestion that the statutes were unconstitutional on the face of things, or as applied to appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, school districts and the Wyoming Education Association, challenged the constitutionality of legislation establishing the method for financing public schools. The District Court of Laramie County, Wyoming, found in general that defendant State met its burden of proving that the revised school funding system itself was adequate, but that some technical issues and adjustments were unconstitutional. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court conducted a strict scrutiny constitutional review of all aspects of funding of the state's educational system and how funds were divided among the state's school districts and schools. The model's cost-based approach, which relied on past statewide average expenditures, was capable of supporting a constitutional school finance system. However, several changes were required: (1) adjustments to the model for inflation using the Wyoming cost-of-living index, including full housing and medical components; (2) adjustments to administrative and classified salaries to account for differences in experience, responsibility, and seniority; (3) development of a formula to determine costs of maintenance and operation; (4) full funding of the costs of educating special needs students, and for vocational and technical training; (5) funding adjustments for small schools and small school districts based on actual differences from larger schools and districts; (6) a one-time payment, fully funding kindergarten costs to resolve an earlier error; and (7) funding for safe and efficient facilities through either a statewide tax or other equally imposed mechanisms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed findings regarding the constitutionality of the cost-based approach, the system used for teacher salaries, and gifted student funding; and the unconstitutionality of methods used for some salaries and small school district adjustments. The court reversed findings on the adjustments, or absence thereof, to costs for some salaries, maintenance, vocational and special needs programs, and kindergarten, and ordered changes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent, a resident of another state, owned property in Wyoming at the time of her death. The Wyoming property consisted of both real and tangible personal property owned in joint tenancy with her husband with right of survivorship, and a separately owned parcel of property. The state department of revenue imposed a transfer tax, which appellant, decedent's estate, appealed. The state board of equalization affirmed. Upon certification to the state's highest court, the judgment was affirmed as the relevant statutes were correctly applied. All of decedent's Wyoming property was included in the federal gross estate in computing her federal taxable estate. There was no question that the clear and unambiguous language of Wyo. Stat. Ann.  &sect; 39-6-810 imposed the transfer tax on the gross estate, and it was limited by the ratio of the Wyoming gross estate to the federal gross estate. The intention of the legislature to impose the tax upon the Wyoming gross estate in proportion to the total federal gross estate could not have been expressed more clearly. Appellant failed to sustain the burden of persuasion that the agency failed to apply the law correctly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the agency correctly applied the relevant statutes in determining the transfer tax on appellant estate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant telephone utility companies petitioned for review of a decision of the Wyoming State Board of Equalization which affirmed final determinations by appellee Wyoming Department of Revenue of the fair market value of the state-assessed industrial telephone tangible property of appellants. The petition and matter were certified to the court by the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were three telephone utility companies that bought telephone exchanges, distribution, and other assets, including certificates of convenience and necessity, from a large regional telephone utility. Certificate lives were later shortened by statute. Other assets needed significant repair. The excess of purchase price over book value determined for rate of return purposes was referred to as acquisition adjustment. The court affirmed the determination of property tax valuation by appellee state department of revenue. The unitary method, which valued a company as a whole statewide working unit, was a rational valuation method of utility fair market value under Wyo. Const. art. 15, &sect; 11. Acquisition adjustment was intangible personal property, normally not taxable, under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-1-101(a)(vii) (Michie 1997). The unitary method could use intangible property as an element of the valuation of the tangible property to the degree intangible property enhanced its value. Appellants did not carry their burden to prove an allocation of acquisition adjustment to intangibles, such as the certificates, goodwill, or rights of way, or to prove economic obsolescence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed. The unitary method was a rational valuation method of utility fair market value. Acquisition adjustment, excess of purchase price over book value, was statutory intangible personal property. The unitary method could use intangible property in the valuation of the tangible property to the degree the intangible property enhanced its value. Appellants did not prove a different allocation or economic obsolescence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought a wrongful death and survival action, Wyo. Stat.

Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing the claim was time barred. The trial court granted the motion, and plaintiff appealed. Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-38-102 required that a wrongful death action be brought within two years of the death of decedent. The court held that this two-year limitations period was a condition precedent as opposed to a statute of limitations, and could not be tolled by the discovery rule. The court held this rule did not violate Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, which provided for open courts. The court found that in Wyoming, the right to sue for wrongful death was created purely by statute, and the two-year limitations period was an integral part of the statute. The court held the action could not proceed as a survival action, which carried a longer limitations period, because plaintiff alleged that her husband's death resulted from injuries inflicted by the appellees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal, because plaintiff failed to bring the action within two years of the death of her husband as required by the state wrongful death statute, and the limitations period could not be tolled by the discovery rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aiding and abetting in the commission of attempted burglary, by acting as a lookout, in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-3-301, 6-1-201 (Lexis 1999). She appealed, arguing that a locked fishing reel display case in a department store was not a separately secured portion of a building within the meaning of Wyoming's burglary statute. The court reversed, concluding that the statute's &quot;separately secured&quot; language was considered in conjunction with the &quot;occupied portion.&quot; Thus, to be susceptible to burglary the &quot;separately secured&quot; portion had to be large enough to be occupied by a human being. The court found that the burglary statute was designed primarily to protect not only those places where people slept, but also those places that a person could occupy. For the burglary statute to protect people within dwellings or places of business, the area in which the crime was committed had to be large enough to admit a human being. The display case, even though secured with a lock, was not large enough to accommodate a human being; thus, it was not a separately secured or occupied portion of a building.</SPAN></P>

Appellant father argued at the time he signed the documents appellee representative told him if he did not remove the baby from the hospital, the state was going to take the baby as an abandoned baby and even though he knew the contents of both documents he thought he was releasing and relinquishing the child to foster care to avoid abandonment. Appellant filed a petition to establish paternity, award him custody and revoke his consent to adoption but summary judgement was granted for appellants on the threshold issue of whether appellant could revoke consent. The court dismissed issues requiring joinder of the prospective adoptive parents and affirmed the summary judgment finding appellant's consent to adoption was not secured by fraud or duress, and therefore was irrevocable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested during an investigatory stop occasioned by the vehicle in which he was riding being registered to a person with an outstanding felony warrant and the house where he was observed being watched for drug trafficking. He was the only defense witness. He was represented by several different public defenders between pretrial and sentencing. He was convicted of possession with intent to deliver psilocybin mushrooms and possessing marijuana and sentenced to prison. He appealed on four grounds: (1) evidentiary violations for introducing prior drug transactions, (2) due process and right to counsel violations at sentencing, (3) free exercise violation because he claimed the mushrooms were for religious purposes, and (4) ineffective assistance of counsel. The convictions were affirmed, the court finding no trial errors, but the case was remanded for resentencing because defendant had not knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel at sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 6-4-403, necessarily broad to protect children, was sufficiently definite to give notice concerning prohibited criminal conduct, thus, it was not unconstitutionally vague because it did not enumerate specific prohibited conduct. Although appellant claimed she was coerced to delay seeking medical treatment for her daughter, the record did not establish that she faced present, imminent or impending death or serious bodily harm, thus, the trial court did not err in refusing to give her defense instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Appellant, free on bond, did not suffer significant prejudice when recording problems caused the lengthy trial delay. Although necessarily broad to protect children, the child endangerment statute was sufficiently definite concerning prohibited criminal conduct, therefore, it was not unconstitutionally vague by failing to enumerate specifically prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On certified review from the District Court of Campbell County (Wyoming), petitioner doctor requested review of a Wyoming Board of Medicine administrative order which conditioned her practice of medicine and required her to pay certain costs of administrative proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner doctor challenged respondent Wyoming Board of Medicine's conditioning of petitioner's practice of medicine and requirement she pay certain costs of administrative proceedings. Petitioner appealed, arguing procedural defects in the hearing and that the statute requiring only a preponderance of the evidence standard for administratively disciplining attorneys was unconstitutional under equal protection and due process standards. The court found, under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33-26-403(b) &amp; 408(c), petitioner's due process was violated by respondent's withholding of a report of an examination of petitioner. Moreover, contact between respondent's attorneys and respondent were inappropriate where respondent's attorneys were prosecuting the disciplinary hearing and no substantial evidence sustained respondent's allegation because there existed no expert medical testimony. Finally, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33-26-407(b) was unconstitutional under equal protection and due process because it allowed a lower standard to be used to administratively discipline petitioner where other professions enjoyed a clear and convincing standard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, finding the Wyoming Board of Medicine disciplined petitioner in violation of state statutes related to administrative due process and that the Wyoming statute allowing a lower standard for administratively disciplining the holder of a medical license versus other professions was unconstitutional under equal protection and due process.</SPAN></P>
