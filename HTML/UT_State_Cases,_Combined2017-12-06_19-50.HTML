<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-In a termination of parental-rights case, the denial of counsel to the father violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because his right to the companionship, care, custody, and management of his child was clearly an important interest, and there appeared to be a risk of self-incrimination through the disclosure of information in the termination case regarding his use of controlled substances; the State's interest in not appointing counsel was relatively weak as its pecuniary interest in not appointing counsel was hardly significant enough to overcome the father's rights to his child, and the State still shared with the father an interest in a correct decision; and the risk of error was significant in the privately initiated termination proceedings as the father did not enjoy the additional protections provided in state-initiated termination cases.</SPAN></P>

XIV; [3]-The district court did not err in declining to merge defendant's child kidnapping and aggravated murder convictions; [4]-Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-207.7 does not in fact provide for a presumptive life sentence without parole but rather grants the sentencing court reasonable discretion to impose either an indeterminate term of year sentence not less than 20 years or a life sentence without parole, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

XVI, &sect; 5 was answered in the negative because the plain language of the Utah Health Care Malpractice Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 78B-3-401 to -425, foreclosed any reading under which it was inapplicable as a whole to wrongful-death cases, the Legislature did not account for the constitutionally significant differences between the operation of the cap inside and outside of the wrongful death context when it inserted the damages cap in 1986, and the damages allowed under the seminal case of Webb v. Denver &amp; R.G.W. Railway, 24 P. 616 (Utah Terr. 1890), and its progeny were not limited to economic damages.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-The district court properly held that UDOT had the authority to condemn excess property for transportation purposes under Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 72-5-103 and 72-5-113 because the eminent domain statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-6-501, was only a starting point, subject to supplementation by further legislative enactments; [2]-The case was remanded to allow the district court to determine the constitutionality of UDOT's condemnation of the owner's excess property under &sect; 75-5-113 because there was no constitutional analysis in the decision presented for appellate review, and UDOT did not clearly articulate its anticipated plans for the excess property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge argued that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78A-7-206(1)(e), the statutory provision he stipulated to having violated, was unconstitutional. The supreme court declined to reach this issue because a judge may not properly assert for the first time in a disciplinary proceeding the defense that the law the judge had violated was unconstitutional. Judges were not at liberty to disregard the law and only later, after they were caught, challenge the law's constitutionality. None of the mitigating factors offered by the judge persuaded the supreme court that the sanctions to which he stipulated would be unjust or improper. Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78A-7-27(2) did not prohibit justice court judges from voluntarily accepting a lower salary in order to comply with &sect; 78A-7-206(1)(e). The supreme court adopted the JCC's factual findings, legal conclusions, and proposed sanctions. The ordered repayments would not violate &sect; 78A-7-207(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the prosecution and the trial court violated his constitutional rights by charging him with and trying him for aggravated murder instead of murder. He also argued that the content of the victim impact testimony at his sentencing hearing violated his constitutional rights. The court concluded that defendant failed to show that the decision to charge him with aggravated murder imposed any disparate treatment on him. Therefore, defendant could not show that the charging decision violated the uniform operation of laws clause of Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 24. The court was not persuaded that the aggravated murder statute was unconstitutional. Prosecutors exercised traditional prosecutor discretion in choosing to charge defendant with aggravated murder. He committed murder in the course of multiple aggravated felonies against multiple victims, including children. The introduction of the victim impact testimony in this case did not violate the Eighth Amendment; therefore, its admission could not have been plain error, nor could it have been ineffective assistance of counsel to fail to object to it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill affected the state's educational system. The supreme court held appellants had no traditional standing because they had no personal stake, as (1) their voter status gave no such stake, and (2) State Board of Education (Board) membership did not let them contest their duties' alleged infringement. They had public interest standing to claim Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 22 violations because (1) its limits were important, and (2) they were &quot;appropriate&quot; parties, as they united to bring the challenge, their issues were unlikely to be raised if they were denied standing, and they sought to enforce an explicit, mandatory constitutional provision on form and process. They had no public-interest standing to raise Utah Const. art. X, &sect; 3 claims because (1) its delegation to the Board was not of a sufficient general interest, and (2) they did not develop the Board's supervision of public education. Their Utah Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of one count of rape, three counts of forcible sodomy, and three counts of forcible sexual abuse. However, the Third District Court, West Jordan, Utah, arrested the judgment and granted a new trial on all counts based on evidentiary errors and several &quot;irregularities&quot; that occurred during trial. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the trial court properly excluded evidence under Utah R. Evid. 412 regarding a prior, unrelated incident involving one of the victims. A teacher would have testified that one of the victims made inappropriate sexual advances toward her. The fate of the excluded evidence could not justify arresting the verdict. The exclusion of the rule 412 evidence did not violate the due process clause by lowering the State's burden of proof. Excluding the evidence did not violate defendant's right of confrontation. The State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant enticed the teenage victims, not that the victims were sexually inexperienced. The other claimed errors and irregularities did not require reversal because they did not prejudice defendant. The only issue the trial court cited that could conceivably have impacted a juror was the admission into evidence of a topless photo of defendant. The photo was taken from defendant's cell phone and enlarged to fit an 8 1/2 x 11 inch sheet of paper. It was highly unlikely that the enlargement of the photo impacted the jury's deliberations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought certiorari review of a decision from the Court of Appeals (Utah), which denied his petition for extraordinary relief challenging respondent district court's judge's imposition of a more severe sentence following a de novo trial on appeal of a justice court guilty plea to disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence in the justice court resulted from a plea agreement. The court held that the district court's imposition of a harsher sentence following an appeal did not violate either Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-405(1) or due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Although a trial de novo pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78A-7-118(1)(b) did not involve setting aside a justice court judgment on direct review, the case law was clear that &sect; 76-3-405(1) applied to justice courts, and no argument had been made for overruling that precedent. Consequently, the exception in &sect; 76-3-405(2)(b) allowing a more severe punishment following an appeal in a plea bargain case necessarily applied to appeals from justice court convictions. Due process under the Fourteenth Amendment also did not preclude a more severe punishment following an appeal in a plea bargain case because there was no presumption of vindictiveness in the plea bargaining context. Absent any evidence suggesting actual vindictiveness, the imposition of a more severe sentence following an appeal was not a due process violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant convicted of aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder filed a pro se petition seeking post-conviction relief under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-9-104(1)(d) on the grounds of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. Defendant requested appointed counsel. The trial court, Second District, Farmington, Utah, denied the request for counsel as premature and granted the State's motion for summary judgment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the defense of extreme emotional distress under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-202(3)(a)(i) (2003) and that his appellate counsel was ineffective under U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV for failing to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal. The court concluded that the trial record suggested that the defense likely would have been available to petitioner and that disputed issues of material fact precluded summary judgment on the claim that appellate counsel was ineffective because the record did not show whether appellate counsel investigated trial counsel's failure to raise the defense or what such an investigation might have uncovered. Because the court could not determine whether appellate counsel was ineffective, it could not determine whether defendant's claim regarding trial counsel was procedurally barred by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-9-106(1)(b)-(c). Finally, the court held that, because defendant had established that his claims were sufficiently complex, a renewed motion to appoint counsel on remand under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-9-109 would be well founded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the summary judgment and remanded with instructions for the court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether defendant's appellate counsel was ineffective, and upon a determination that appellate counsel was indeed ineffective, to conduct an additional evidentiary hearing to determine whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a defense of extreme emotional distress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney submitted an application for admission to respondent Utah State Bar by motion under former Utah Sup. Ct. R. Prof. Prac. 14-705. The Bar denied the attorney's application because he had not actively practiced law in Idaho for the required period. The Bar's admissions committee denied the attorney's request for review in which he sought an exception or waiver of the active practice requirement. The attorney timely appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By the time the attorney applied for admission to the Utah State Bar, he had accumulated more than 17 years of active legal practice in Idaho. But he did not actively practice law in Idaho for three of the five years preceding his application for admission to the Utah State Bar. Although there was no doubt that the attorney had accrued significant legal experience since his admission to the Idaho State Bar in 1983, at the time he sought admission to the Utah State Bar, his legal experience was not current. Former Utah Sup. Ct. R. Prof. Prac. 14-705 did not contemplate the admission of lawyers who merely had significant past legal experience. Instead, Rule 14-705 permitted a lawyer to be admitted on motion only if the lawyer's legal experience was both current and substantial. Specifically, in 2010, Rule 14-705 required that the applicant had to have actively practiced law in Idaho for at least three of the previous five years immediately preceding the date of the filing of the application. Because the attorney's legal experience was not current, it did not serve the purpose of Rule 14-705. The supreme court declined to waive the active practice requirement for the attorney.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the network's due process right to notice under the 14th Amendment was not violated because notice by publication was permitted given that the large group of appellants, including all citizens who lived in the vicinity of the proposed sports, recreation and education complex, which ranged in the tens or hundreds of thousands, shared a narrow public interest, the city had an interest in issuing the bonds approved by voters to construct the complex for its citizens, and additional notice such as mail would have provided no additional benefit to appellants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's convictions were affirmed in 1997, and the supreme court denied certiorari in October 1997. In 2009, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which was ultimately dismissed under the PCRA's one-year time bar. This appeal followed. On review, the supreme court determined that petitioner failed to preserve his habeas corpus and common law exception arguments. Next, petitioner's argument relating to an &quot;egregious injustice&quot; exception in Gardner v. State was rejected. Petitioner failed to present a reasonable justification for raising his claims more than 10 years after the statute of limitations expired. He was unable to demonstrate that his case met the threshold requirement because his petition did not provide any arguable basis in fact that would have supported a claim for relief based on ineffectiveness of counsel as a matter of law. The case did not present an issue that would have justified consideration of whether to recognize an exception to the PCRA's procedural bars. However, petitioner might have had a newly acquired claim for relief under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-9-104(1) based on the decision in Lafler v. Cooper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the plea bargaining process was vacated, and the matter was remanded to the district court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee adoption agency petitioned for a ruling that appellant biological father of a child had no parental rights in the child due to the father's failure to register a notice of paternity proceedings before the birth mother consented to adoption of the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father sent a notice of paternity proceedings to the proper state registration office, but the office delayed filing the notice in its putative father registry until after the adoption agency checked the registry to determine if the father's consent was required. The Utah Supreme Court held that, while strict compliance with the registration requirements was required, and registration was only complete upon filing by the office in the registry pursuant to the Utah Adoption Act (Act), the father was denied due process in requiring the father to comply with the registry filing which he had no ability to control. The father sent the notice prior to the mother's consent to the adoption, and the alleged negligence of the registration office in failing timely to file the notice could not be the basis for relinquishment of the father's parental rights. Thus, the father's notice of the paternity proceeding must be considered filed when it was received by the registration office since, at that time, the father had done everything he could do to strictly comply with the Act and preserve his opportunity to develop a relationship with the chid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court denied defendant's motion to reduce his conviction under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-402(2) (2005) (Section 402). Defendant argued that Amended Section 402 could not be applied retroactively. The supreme court found that Section 402 was substantive with regard to defendant's eligibility for reduction his convictions. Section 402 governed the scope of a defendant's vested or contractual rights in the ultimate conviction and associated sentence, rather than the mode and form of procedure for filing a motion to reduce a conviction. The plea agreement evidenced the intent of all involved entities to resolve the case in contemplation of Section 402 as it existed at the time of initial sentencing. The supreme court therefore applied the version of Section 402 that existed at the time of defendant's initial sentencing. Amended Section 402 included no express declaration of retroactivity. Amended Section 402 did not apply to defendant's motion to reduce his convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously had dismissed on laches grounds an extraordinary writ petition challenging a Utah probate court's reformation and subsequent administration of a charitable religious trust. A federal district court, which was considering constitutional challenges to the trust reformation and administration, ruled that the laches decision was not preclusive. The court noted that its resolution of certified questions under Utah R. App. P. 41(c)(2) properly included discussion of the surrounding facts and circumstances to illustrate the application of its answer in the context of the case. The court held that when it exercised jurisdiction over an extraordinary writ pursuant to Utah Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 and Utah R. Civ. P. 65B, a decision denying relief on laches grounds was on the merits under Utah R. Civ. P. 41(b) and thus had preclusive effect. Utah's laches jurisprudence was concerned only with prejudice to a defendant caused by a plaintiff's unexplained and unreasonable delay, not with harm to the plaintiff. An adequate factual basis supported the laches ruling. No constitutional violation resulted from the application of laches to structural constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that under Utah law, a dismissal of an extraordinary writ on laches grounds precluded a subsequent claim.</SPAN></P>

The claimants alleged it fraudulently offered a travel and lodging certificate for listening to a sales pitch and it then made it very difficult to redeem it. The former employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee formed a consumer group to sue the former employer after the former employer, a timeshare company, offered certificates for travel and lodging to market a new resort and then made it intentionally difficult to redeem them. The former employer sued him, and claimed, inter alia, intentional interference with existing and potential economic relations and violation of the Utah Uniform Trade Secrets Act.  During the resulting jury trial, the consumer group repeatedly referenced other consumers who suffered the same fate, but who were not parties to the lawsuit. The jury awarded actual economic damages and declined to award any actual damages for emotional distress. It also awarded each claimant punitive damages. On appeal, the former employer claimed, inter alia, that the punitive damage award violated procedural due process principles. The state supreme court found that: (1) the former employer's procedural due process rights were violated when jury was asked to consider harm to nonparties; (2) the former employer did not show it was prejudiced by consolidation of consumer group's claims; and (3) the claimants' fraud claims could be assigned to the consumer group.</SPAN></P>

Inter alia, the Utah Attorney General had taken actions that undercut the special fiduciary's ability to obtain payments owed to the trust. The State should have moved for termination if it felt that the special fiduciary was mismanaging the trust. Moreover, there was no abuse of discretion in the amount awarded to the special fiduciary. Even though the State's constitutional challenges were not preserved, they were considered under the plain error exception. The monetary judgment against the State did not violate Utah Const. art. V, &sect; 1. Moreover, there was no violation of Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 29 either because there was no extension of credit. The State's motion for contribution was not ripe because it had not paid in accordance with the court order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed after he was convicted of aggravated murder and aggravated burglary and sentenced to death. The supreme court affirmed however. Following the denial of his for-cause challenge, defendant used a peremptory challenge to remove prospective juror 20. Where a defendant used a peremptory challenge to remove a juror who should have been removed for cause, defendant was required to show prejudice, which he failed to do. Additionally, the trial court's occasional failures to admonish the jury did not result in harm to defendant. Because it was not a critical stage of the proceeding, and because the response did not harm defendant, neither his right to be present nor his right to counsel were violated by the judge's responses to the two notes from the jury during the guilt phase. Further, because defendant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he had the requisite intellectual deficits, the supreme court upheld the trial court's conclusion that he did not qualify as mentally retarded under the Exemption Statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann &sect;&sect; 77-15a-101 to 77-15a-106.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice lawsuit, plaintiff parents alleged that the employees of defendant hospital breached their duty of care during the mother's labor and delivery of the child. The parents also claimed that the hospital's negligence caused the child to suffer severe brain damage. A jury for the Fourth District, Provo Dep't, Utah, found that the hospital was not negligent. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents were concerned that, if evidence of private insurance and public benefit program payments was presented at trial, the jury would infer that they were seeking a double recovery, thereby prejudicing their case. To avoid that prejudice, the parents filed a pretrial motion in limine asking the trial court to exclude collateral source evidence pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-3-405. The trial court granted the motion and ordered the parties to present evidence on the subject of health insurance benefits outside the presence of the jury and to redact health insurance benefits from exhibits submitted to the jury. However, the hospital repeatedly violated the in limine order by questioning witnesses about payments the parents received from government benefit programs and by highlighting the lack of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the parents in providing care for their child. The supreme court found that the hospital adopted a trial strategy of circumventing the trial court's in limine order by presenting forbidden collateral source evidence to the jury. Thus, the hospital's trial strategy substantially prejudiced the parents' verdict-worthiness before the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated the jury's verdict and remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Due to the broad grant of discretion ceded to the jury by the sufficiency of the evidence standard and by the &quot;harmful to minors&quot; statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1201(5)(a), the supreme court affirmed. His U.S. Const. amend. V right was not violated because he was not in custody and Miranda warnings were not required. Defendant's liberty was not restrained beyond his usual status as a jail inmate, nor was he coerced in any way. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's conclusion that defendant &quot;distributed&quot; the material to a minor and that the material was &quot;harmful.&quot; The State's presentation of only the drawings in question fell within the parameters of the harmful to minors statute, and the jury reasonably drew the inference that the material met the elements of harmful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In protracted litigation arising out of a real-property exaction imposed on plaintiff developer as a condition of a construction permit for a 15-acre residential housing development, the Third District Court, Salt Lake, Utah, concluded that defendant county's exaction did not violate the Dolan rough-proportionality standard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no error in the trial court's judgment. The county's purpose for imposing the exaction was to alleviate the developer's impact (increased traffic) on a state-owned - and state-funded - highway. Because the county's purpose for imposing the exaction was to alleviate the development's impact on a state-funded road, the state's costs of improving that road were a proper measure of the development's impact. The developer's takings claim was properly dismissed. The infrastructure costs attributable to the development were $337,500, while the cost to the developer of the 13 ft. exaction was $83,997. The exaction therefore cost the developer roughly 25% of the impact the developer imposed on the community. Accordingly, the exaction imposed on the developer withstood rough proportionality review. The trial court did not err by including in its rough-proportionality analysis costs borne by state government entities, nor did it err by limiting the scope of its review to the developer's 13 ft. road dedication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A majority of the court agreed on the following: First, three members of the court held that the court of appeals erred in limiting its review to whether the district court had complied with rule 11 during the plea hearing and in assuming that a violation of rule 11 during a plea hearing automatically rendered a plea unknowing and involuntary; however, the record demonstrated that defendant's plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made, as there was no evidence that he had been informed of the elements of sexual battery. Second, three members of the court held that the court of appeals did not err in declining to require a showing of prejudice because such a showing was not required by rule 11(l). Finally, the court unanimously held that it current holding--that a defendant had to understand the elements of an offense for a plea to be knowing and voluntary--did not conflict with prior case law finding that a defendant, under certain circumstances, could lawfully plead guilty to a crime he factually did not commit to avoid risking conviction on another more serious charge.

The supreme court concluded that the legislature intended for &quot;exclusive possession&quot; to be read according to its ordinary and accepted meaning. Because the statute taxed a user or possessor of exempt property at the same rate as it would a fee simple owner of nonexempt property, the legislature intended to tax those who used or possessed, in a manner akin to an owner, property that was exempt from taxation. &quot;Exclusive possession&quot; had to mean the same present right to occupy and control property that would exist for a fee simple owner of that property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative father filed a paternity petition, requesting that he be given custody of the parties' child. However, he did not file a sworn statement pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-6-121(3) (Supp. 2011). Although he later amended his petition to include the affidavit, the amended petition was filed after the mother had executed her consent to an adoption. The trial court dismissed the putative father's petition as untimely. On appeal, the court held that the trial court correctly dismissed the putative father's amended petition as untimely because it was not filed until after the mother had executed her consent to adoption. The relation back doctrine of Utah R. Civ. P. 15(c) did not apply. Application of the doctrine would upset the legislature's intent that unmarried biological fathers strictly comply with the requirements of &sect; 78B-6-121. The court declined to address the putative father's constitutional claims and his claim under the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738A, because he did not preserve them under Utah R. App. P. 24(a)(5)(A)-(B). His appellate brief did not provide any citation to the record showing where he preserved his constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>

That evidence would have opened the door to the prosecution to introduce substantial aggravating evidence that through trial counsel's efforts was excluded at trial. Petitioner's child services, corrections, and Utah State Hospital records contained evidence that petitioner committed an assault while housed at the Millard County Jail; that he authored a document detailing the protocol for home invasion robberies that advised shooting occupants when necessary; and that he had a significant juvenile record, including four offenses that would have been felonies had he committed them as an adult. Had trial counsel introduced evidence that petitioner would be peaceful if incarcerated, the prosecution would have been allowed to counter petitioner's assertions of his peaceful nature by introducing that significant aggravating evidence. It was accordingly not unreasonable for counsel to choose to present an innocence defense in lieu of a fuller mitigation case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District Court, Salt Lake, Utah, granted summary judgment in favor of appellee county on appellant developer's due process and takings claim, finding that the FR-20 zoning rule was not arbitrary and capricious and upholding the county council's authority to rescind its October 18 rezoning ordinance. The court rejected the developer's takings claim. The developer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that in defining the FR-20 zoning rule, the county concluded that this objection generally would be advanced by prohibiting residential construction on parcels smaller than 20 acres. That was a rational judgment. The developer's appeal was properly directed to the county's adoption of the FR-20 zone and its rescission of an ordinance that would have repealed it. Any particular quarrel with the county's failure to allow an exception to the FR-20 zone was the subject of the request for a variance from the Board of Adjustment. The supreme court upheld the council's November 1 rescission decision on the ground that it satisfied all of the standards set forth in Robert's Rule 37. The council retained the power of rescission under Rule 37; a Rule 36 motion to reconsider was not subject to the same time limitations that governed under Rule 36. Under Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 22, the developer did not demonstrate that it had any vested right in its preferred zoning of the property in question. The developer's takings claim failed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no reason to disturb the Commission's finding that the supplemental invoice the taxpayer provided was insufficient to establish the existence of delivery charges because the invoice was created up to three years after the transactions.

The supreme court found that based on the lack of evidence from the constitutional convention, the common definition of the term &quot;irrigate&quot; at the time the Utah Constitution was enacted, and the definition of &quot;irrigate&quot; suggested from case law around that time, that the term &quot;irrigate&quot; in art. XIII, &sect; 2 included both agricultural and non-agricultural watering of land. The company's water distribution facilities were taxed as improvements to real property. They were, and were treated as, different property from the real property that the distribution facilities served. The tax was not on the same property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The unmarried birth parents were residents of Virginia. The mother consented to an adoption. Appellee adoptive parents travelled to Utah and petitioned for adoption. The Virginia court issued an order granting the birth father child custody. He filed a motion in the Utah court contesting the adoption and requesting permission to intervene. The motion was properly denied. On appeal, he challenged the authority of the Utah court to decide the case. The Supreme Court of Utah held that the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738A, applied to adoption proceedings, because they were child custody determinations. However, PKPA did not strip the Utah courts of subject matter jurisdiction over the adoption. Because the birth father neither raised the PKPA in the Utah district court nor challenged the Utah court's jurisdiction to hear the adoption proceeding, the issue was waived. By failing to timely assert his parental rights prior to the birth mother's relinquishment of her parental rights, the birth father waived all rights to contest the adoption under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-6-122 (Supp. 2010).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Utah's measurable amount provision violated the due process and the uniform operation of laws clause of the Utah Constitution. The supreme court noted that the State could not convict a defendant under the measurable amount provision, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 58-37-8, 58-37-2, by simply presenting evidence that the illegal substance was present in the body, it had to also prove that defendant knowingly and intentionally introduced the substance into his body. Defendant pled guilty to having ingested methamphetamine into his body in a voluntary and knowing manner, and the State was relieved from presenting evidence to that effect. The provision did not violate Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The measurable amount provision did not violate Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 24 as the crime being punished was the act of using or being under the influence of a controlled substance, not the amount of the substance in the body. The State had a legitimate interest in preventing illegal drug use precisely because of the intoxicating effects experienced by the user while the drug was being metabolized by the body.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the tax court correctly conducted a trial de novo with no deference to previous Commission decisions because it was required by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-1-601 (2008) as the taxpayer chose to proceed under &sect; 59-1-601 rather than Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 59-1-610(1), 63G-4-403(1), (4). The tax court also correctly required proof by a preponderance of the evidence pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-1-604 (2008). The court further held that the tax court correctly excluded the taxpayer's accounting goodwill from property tax because: (1) goodwill was not exempt from taxation under 1998 Utah Property Tax Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 59-2-101 to 59-2-1372, because it did not fit within the definition of intangible property under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-102(17) (2000), as it was not an exchangeable asset that was separate from other assets of the entity; and (2) because goodwill was property and Utah's corporate income tax imposed a tax on the income derived from all property, the income derived from goodwill was already being taxed, and therefore Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2, cl. 5, prohibited a property tax from being levied on the taxpayer's goodwill.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect;&sect; 1, 7, and 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A doctor who was treating the parents' son for cancer reported the parents to the DCFS for suspected medical neglect after the doctor concluded they were refusing the son lifesaving medical care, chemotherapy. The parents brought an action against defendants for violation of their federal and state constitutional rights. A federal court awarded summary judgment to defendants on the federal claims. The trial court applied collateral estoppel and dismissed the state law claims. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in applying collateral estoppel because the legal standard for state and federal constitutional violations was not identical. However, the claims against the assistant attorney general and one physician were barred under the doctrine of quasi-judicial immunity because the claims arose out of their roles in which they played an integral part in the judicial process. The claims against the remaining three defendants failed because, as a matter of law, the parents did not meet their burden of demonstrating that damages were an appropriate remedy for the alleged unconstitutional conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both parties received clear title reports before entering into the lease. A triple net provision stated that the tenant was responsible for all impositions and costs relating to the property and that the landlord would have no cost or expense. The lease also stated that the tenant was responsible for resolving all covenants, restrictions, and conditions pertaining to the property. A subsequent title report revealed that an easement purporting to affect the property had been recorded against an adjacent lot. The trial court found that there was no valid easement against the property. The court noted that the controversy was not moot because no quiet title action had been brought against the owner of the adjacent lot. The lease did not warrant that the property was free of encumbrances and clearly expressed the parties' intent to allocate unanticipated costs to the tenant. The leasehold interest was sufficient under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-6-1301 (2010) to give the tenant standing to pursue a quiet title action. Although the tenant's standing arose from contract, the district court's jurisdiction under Utah Const. art. VIII, &sect; 5 and Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78A-5-102 (2010) was not affected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asked the supreme court to dismiss the case in the district court on the basis that the automatic waiver statute underpinning district court jurisdiction was unconstitutional. The supreme court found that the automatic waiver statute passed a rational basis standard of review under substantive due process as protection of society from dangerous individuals was unquestionably a legitimate government purpose, and potentially longer incarceration was rationally related to that purpose. Because defendant was sixteen years old and was charged with murder, he fell under Utah's automatic waiver statute and was immediately subject to the district court's jurisdiction. He did not possess any initial statutory rights associated with juvenile court protections and thus could not be deprived of rights he never held. The statute clearly applied equally to all persons within the classes it created and the disparate treatment given the statutory classes was based on differences that had a reasonable tendency to further the objectives of the statute. There was no valid basis for defendant's arguments for a constitutional right for all minors to be prosecuted in juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the authority of a city attorney was entirely encompassed in the Utah Code; it was the legislature that permitted the creation of a city attorney and defined the scope of that office, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 10-3-928 (2007). The plain language of this section permitted a city attorney to prosecute only limited types of violations of state law (infractions and misdemeanors) that occurred within the boundaries of that city attorney's municipality.  This was the scope of authority, in the context of prosecuting violations of state law, that the legislature vested in city attorneys. Neither the prosecutors subject to &sect; 10-3-928 nor the courts were empowered to expand that authority.

R. Prof'l Prac. 14-709(a) for failing to upload his answers. Petitioner had been afforded significant procedural due process, including seven notices that he had to upload his essay answers by 10 p.m. and an exhaustive set of hearings, culminating with an appearance before the supreme court. His substantive due process claim was similarly unavailing since the Bar's 10 p.m. deadline was rationally related to the Bar's legitimate interest in the efficient administration of the exam. Finally, his equal protection claim failed because the Bar had a rational reason for treating computer examinees, differently from those examinees who handwrote their answers, including to prevent cheating, to ensure effective exam administration, and to keep down costs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Members of a church deeded property to the trust to be managed by church leaders and used to minister to the members' needs. The district court reformed the trust after finding that the trustees had breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudent trust administration and that several trust provisions were flawed and unworkable. The association filed its petition over four years after the appointment of the special fiduciary and nearly three years after the reformation of the trust. The court held that laches barred all of the claims, except for a religious discrimination claim, because the record showed a lack of diligence in filing the petition and prejudice resulting from that lack of diligence. Many individuals had relied upon the district court's final order in changing their positions, some trust participants had made irreversible decisions, and the special fiduciary had entered into irrevocable transactions and obligations. The religious discrimination claim was not ripe for consideration because the association, in alleging that religion might be used as a basis for determining property distributions, did not contend that such discrimination actually had occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Fifth District, St. George (Utah) found defendant guilty of two counts of rape as an accomplice under Utah Code &sect;&sect; 76-2-202 and 76-5-402 (2008) for his role in the compelled marriage of the 14-year-old victim to her 19-year-old first cousin, and the resulting sexual intercourse between them. Defendant appealed his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To convict defendant as an accomplice to rape, the State was required to establish that he, acting with the requisite mental intent, solicited, requested, commanded, encouraged or intentionally aided the husband in having nonconsensual sexual intercourse with the victim. Because defendant did not engage in sexual intercourse with the victim, it was erroneous for the jury instructions to equate the term &quot;actor&quot; with the term &quot;defendant&quot; in instructing the jury as to whether the State had met its burden of proving that the sexual intercourse was nonconsensual. Also, the term &quot;actor&quot; as used in Utah Code &sect; 76-5-406(10) and (11) referred to the person who engaged in the act of sexual intercourse. Thus, those subsections could not be applied to defendant. Because the consent instructions told the jury that defendant's position of special trust and his enticement of the victim could give rise to a lack of consent, they were erroneous. Without defendant's proposed instruction as to intent, the jury could have convicted him if it found that he intentionally did some act, and such intentional act unintentionally aided the husband in having nonconsensual sexual intercourse with the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed defendant's convictions and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

On review of summary judgment, the court held that petitioner's due process claims were barred because they could have been, but were not, asserted in his second petition for post-conviction relief or within one year of the conclusion of his federal evidentiary hearing in 1999. Further, petitioner's cruel and unusual punishment claims were barred because they would have been, but were not, asserted during his second state petition for post-conviction relief or at some time more than one year before the filing of the petition at issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected appellee biological mother's argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction to address the merits of the father's motion challenging the adoption of his daughter by her maternal grandparents because the father was not a party to the adoption proceeding, was not served with notice of the adoption proceeding, and did not consent to the adoption. As such, the father fell within the class of persons who could mount a collateral attack on an adoption decree under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-6-133(7) (2008). However, the putative father failed to secure the statutory right to consent to the adoption because he did not comply with the statutory requirements, and his constitutional rights were not violated because he had an adequate opportunity to comply with those statutory requirements. Because the putative father failed to do so and because the relationship he developed over two months was insufficient to give rise to constitutional protection independent of state law, the denial of the putative father's right to consent pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-6-121(3) (2008) did not operate to deny him liberty without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed suit after the city diverted water from an aquifer in a manner that lowered the surrounding water table and made the soil less saturated, which diminution in soil saturation made it more costly for them to irrigate their land and impaired their ability to raise crops and livestock. On review of summary judgment granted in favor of the city, the court held that the mere fact that the presence of water in the soil allowed the property owners to more beneficially use other water did not legally entitle them to be compensated for a reduction in the level of the water table. The property owners did not have a vested right and thus could not be afforded relief under the takings clause of U.S. Const. amend V or Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 22. However, the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the city on the property owners' negligence claim because the district court erred in concluding that the city owed no duty to the property owners in its manner of diverting water. Further, the negligence claim was not barred by the statute of limitations because the city's pumping of the wells qualified as a continuing tort.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that, in enacting the special mitigation statute, the legislature provided mentally-ill defendants who acted under a delusion a method of reducing their culpability after the State established every element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The balance struck was permissible under both state and federal law because the statutory scheme was lawful in light of due process and independent state law in that special mitigation was neither an affirmative defense nor a substantive offense that could be charged against a defendant. Further, the special mitigation statute was constitutional under Utah's separation of powers provision because the burden of proof provision was so connected to the substantive right to mitigation created by the statute that it could not be stripped away. In addition, special mitigation was constitutional under the Utah's uniform operation of laws provision and thereby lawful under the less rigorous standards of federal jurisprudence arising from the equal protection clause because the statute did not impose disparate treatment on similarly situated persons.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that the statutes at issue were designed to shield health care providers from liability for providing information regarding other health care providers and their competency to practice medicine. The statutes were never intended to shield hospitals from potential liability or provide protection from medical malpractice claims. Negligent credentialing was simply the application of broad common law principles of negligence and was a natural extension of torts such as negligent hiring. Because there were strong policy reasons for recognizing the cause of action, including the foreseeability of harm to patients where hospitals failed to properly investigate a doctor's qualifications, Utah formally adopted negligent credentialing as a valid common law cause of action.</SPAN></P>

He was placed on nine years of probation. The Utah Court of Appeals affirmed his sentence by finding that his claim failed to meet the requirements of either Utah R. Crim. P. 22(e) or the doctrine of exceptional circumstances. Defendant petitioned for certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that because an illegal sentence under Rule 22(d) included constitutional violations, an appellate court had to allow a petitioner to raise constitutional, as well as jurisdictional and statutory challenges, to his or her sentence under Rule 22(e). The supreme court was allowed to reach the merits of defendant's claim. Defendant's probation sentence did not implicate a fundamental right because a defendant's liberty interest may be infringed by a rational criminal sentence once he has been found guilty as long as the sentence was not cruel or unusual, arbitrary, or discriminatory. Defendant was admittedly guilty of the crimes committed and thus a court was authorized to impose a sentence pursuant to the terms of a rational sentencing statute.&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-18-1 generally, as well as the term of probation to which defendant was sentenced, were rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in making victims whole through payment of restitution in addition to the other stated needs for probation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit stemming from an unsuccessful prosecution, plaintiff, the accused, challenged several rulings of the Third District Court, Salt Lake County, Utah, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion for partial summary judgment, in dismissing his state claims on the ground of governmental immunity, and  in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants, a municipality and its agents, on his federal civil rights claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An alarm company employee contacted the police, stating that an alarm company security guard had verified a break-in at a high school, while it was actually a school employee who confirmed the alarm and requested the alarm company summon the police. After the employee was acquitted of a charge of making a false alarm, he filed suit. On review, the court held that the district court did not err in denying the employee's motion for partial summary judgment because his acquittal was not conclusive evidence that mandated the application of collateral estoppel principles in his claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution. However, the district court erred in dismissing the state law claims on the ground of governmental immunity because the employee asserted the malice exception under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-4 (1997) when he claimed that he was prosecuted for opposing a city policy regarding police response to burglar alarms. Further, summary judgment on the employee's Fourth Amendment seizure claim was improper because the employee presented facts sufficient to allege that an unlawful seizure occurred. Summary judgment on the remaining federal claims was proper, however.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the alarm company employee's motion for partial summary judgment was affirmed, but the order dismissing the employee's state law claims was reversed. Summary judgment on the employee's seizure claim under U.S. Const. amend. IV was reversed, but summary judgment on the remainder of the employees federal claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He entered a conditional guilty plea to possession of methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia in a drug free zone under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-8. The Court of Appeals of Utah reversed the denial of his motion to suppress. The state supreme court granted certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the passenger in a vehicle stopped for a broken taillight. The police conducted a dog sniff on the car, ordered him out of the car and searched him. He moved to suppress the drugs and drug paraphernalia obtained during the search of his person. The district court denied his motion to suppress, but the court of appeals reversed. The Supreme Court of Utah upheld the decision. The officers improperly extended the duration of the stop by having a drug dog sniff the perimeter of the vehicle; however, the evidence should not be excluded on this basis because the officers relied in good-faith on settled judicial precedent when they conducted the dog sniff. The evidence was subject to suppression, because the officers did not have an objectively reasonable belief that defendant was armed and dangerous when they frisked him and discovered drugs and drug paraphernalia on his person. The presence of thirteen knives in the car did not justify the frisk of defendant.</SPAN></P>

It filed amended severance tax returns for the years 1993-1998. Its subsidiary had allegedly overpaid severance taxes based on improper sale valuation. The Auditing Division of the Utah State Tax Commission denied the refund request. The oil company appealed to the Utah State Tax Commission, which upheld the Division's decision. On review, the Supreme Court of Utah established a new test for determining the point of valuation for oil and gas sales. The court stated that the new rule was to have prospective application only to all those except the oil company. On remand, the Commission issued a $ 3.3 million refund to the oil company. The oil company and its subsidiary filed several other amended tax returns requesting refunds for overpaid severance taxes. The Division denied all but one of these requests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council voted to rezone certain property from critical environment (CE) to planned development (PD), a new zoning category that would allow for a developer to build a residential subdivision. The citizens group filed suit seeking injunctive relief to prohibit rezoning pending the outcome of a citizen referendum. Following a trial, the district court concluded that the rezoning was an administrative act and was therefore not subject to referendum. On review, the court held that, in enacting the PD zone, the city council created a new zoning category, one designed to apply exclusively to the developer. It differed from the prior zoning classification in that density was increased and building restrictions on steep slopes were loosened. Because the city council accomplished those changes by creating a new zoning classification rather than by adjusting the existing zone, however, its adoption of the new zoning classification was per se legislative action and not administrative action. Therefore, its action was subject to a referendum vote by the affected citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After this petition was filed in August 2001, but before the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city, the legislature amended certain sections of the Utah Code relating to the standards for granting disconnection. The district court determined that disconnection was prohibited under both versions of the disconnection statute because it found the two versions identical with regard to what it believed to be the single dispositive issue: that disconnection would form an unincorporated island. The instant court concluded that because the 2003 amendments to the disconnection statute substantively modified the criteria for disconnection, the 2001 version of the statute applied in this case. The changes introduced by the 2003 amendments could not be characterized as procedural. The 2003 amendments were qualitatively different from an alteration to the legal machinery employed for determining the propriety of disconnection. The amendments altered the criteria for determining whether disconnection was allowed. Because the district court failed to consider whether disconnection would materially increase the burdens on the city, it erred in granting summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

For cases filed after Berry but before the 2008 recodification, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-15-6 was not statutory law, but the rule contained therein was in force as part of the common law. The Utah Supreme Court also held that Utah does not follow section 16(b)-(d) of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimant appealed a summary judgment from the Fourth District Court, Heber Dep't (Utah), which ruled that the Utah Governmental Immunity Act barred negligence claims against defendants, a county and a sheriff's deputy, arising from a collision between the claimant's vehicle and the deputy's patrol car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While responding to an emergency call, the deputy struck the claimant's vehicle. Witnesses stated that the deputy had activated both siren and lights. The court stated that operating an emergency vehicle was a governmental function under former Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-3 and that injury caused by negligent operation would waive immunity under former Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-10 (2002). Pursuant to the exception in former &sect; 63-30-10(15), immunity was not waived when the emergency vehicle was driven in accordance with former Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6-14(3), requiring a signal visible or audible from 500 feet in compliance with former Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-6-132 or 41-6-146. The court held that summary judgment was improper because there was no evidence of the witnesses' distance from the patrol car; thus, there was a material factual issue as to how far the signals were visible or audible. Constitutional questions raised by the claimant were not ripe for adjudication. Utah R. Civ. P. 7(c)(3)(D) allowed the county to submit a chief deputy's affidavit in support of a reply memorandum, and his statements about speed in a populated area were proper factual statements under Utah R.

The city's multiyear analysis was not prohibited. It was an appropriate approach for analyzing whether a city's costs exceeded its revenues. The landowner did not present evidence disputing the city's costs/revenue analysis, nor did it show how application of a different fee would have led to a more reasonable result. The landowner failed to show that the city's civil inspection fee was adopted for the purpose of subsidizing its general governmental expenses or that the revenues generated from the fee were excessive. The district court did not err in finding that the city's expert fees were necessary in the defense of the case and were justified by the complexity of the work performed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the holding that the city's fee was unconstitutional; the judgment was affirmed as to the award to the city of its costs incurred in preparing its expert rebuttal report.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into the home of his wife who had recently filed for divorce. He attacked her boyfriend, and stabbed his stepdaughter. Defendant then set the house on fire, killing a six-year-old child. Defendant entered an Alford plea of guilty to aggravated murder. He did not move to withdraw his guilty plea within the time restrictions of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-13-6. Therefore, the Supreme Court of Utah did not have jurisdiction to determine the validity of his guilty plea. The court did hold that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the victim impact evidence introduced at defendant's sentencing hearing. The victim impact testimony was angry in tone, inflammatory in content, and contained messages that defendant was beyond rehabilitation. The victim impact testimony violated the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution. There was a reasonable probability that but for the admission of the victim impact evidence, defendant would have received a more favorable sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, acting through the School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, sought to void, and recover damages based on, its conveyance of school trust lands nearly 90 years before. The State failed to reserve any mineral rights when it conveyed the land. Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-2-201 established a seven-year statute of limitations for the State of Utah to bring any action with respect to real property based upon the State's right or title to the real property. The district court correctly held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-2-201 precluded the State from attempting to obtain full value for school trust lands from defendants. The Supreme Court of Utah affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment for defendants. The State's constitutionally imposed duties as trustee did not exempt the State from the applicable statute of limitations. Utah Const. art. X, &sect; 5(2)(d) makes it clear that the State itself has to bear the costs of its mismanagement of trust property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In ExxonMobil Corp. v. Utah State Tax Comm'n, the court held that valuation for severance tax purposes under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-5-102(1)(a) (2000) was to occur at a certain time. The court limited this holding to prospective application. The taxpayer asked the court to overrule the retroactivity limitation. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. Because the Commission issued deficiency notices against the taxpayer for the second assessment period after the announcement of ExxonMobil, they were not pending or subject to analysis under the rule announced in ExxonMobil. However, a deficiency proceeding against the taxpayer for the first assessment period was pending at the issuance of ExxonMobil and fell within the limitation on retroactivity. Thus, these proceedings were subject to that rule. The court refined its limitation on retroactivity with respect to deficiency assessment matters pending at the time of ExxonMobil. Deficiency assessments issued but unresolved at the time of the decision fell within the ambit of the ExxonMobil analysis. The holding did not apply retroactively to those pending matters that were taxpayer initiated refund requests.</SPAN></P>

Utah Code Ann. &sect; 34A-2-413(5) reduced workers' compensation benefits of individuals receiving both workers' compensation benefits and social security retirement benefits by 50-percent of the amount of their social security retirement benefits. The court ruled that the offset violated the uniform operation of laws provision of the Utah Constitution. On rehearing, the court ruled that claimants who actively negotiated and settled their claims, and thus decided not to challenge the offset, the court's ruling would have no retroactive effect. However, the court ruled that if a claimant's mere acquiescence or challenges on other grounds, constitutional or not, resulted in an administrative order, then the court's ruling would apply retroactively and allow recoupment regarding past payments from their inception.

The escort agencies and the clubs argued that the tax was a violation of their U.S. Const. amend. I rights. The statutory provisions imposing the tax on businesses whose employees provided services while nude were constitutional as a content-neutral regulation of conduct that imposed de minimis burdens on protected expression. The supreme court concluded that nudity was unprotected conduct rather than protected expression because the conduct was not inherently expressive. Further, the tax was narrowly tailored and, therefore, was not substantially overbroad. Nevertheless, the statutory provisions were unconstitutionally vague because the statutory provisions applying the tax to escort services failed to provide a person of ordinary intelligence guidance as to what conduct would trigger the tax and what conduct would not.</SPAN></P>

Ultimately, the Third District Court, Salt Lake, New Mexico, denied the father's motion to dismiss the pending adoption, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the father contended the denial of his motion to dismiss the pending adoption was in error. The supreme court disagreed, finding that he filed his paternity action in New Mexico after the Utah adoption proceedings had begun, and a New Mexico Court of Appeals decision allowing for filing during the pendency of an adoption proceeding did not constitute binding law as it was reversed on certiorari review. The New Mexico Supreme Court's reversal of the case, requiring filing prior to the initiation of an adoption proceeding, was binding as it was a first-impression statutory interpretation and announced a new rule of law; thus, it had retroactive effect. As such, the father failed to comply with New Mexico law, and it was not error for the district court to deny his motion to dismiss the adoption. As the father failed to establish his parental rights in New Mexico, he also failed to accrue the concomitant due process rights with regard to application of the Utah deadline for establishing his parental rights. The father also lacked standing to intervene as his New Mexico paternity order was invalid and thus did not grant him a protectable interest in the adoption proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that although U.S. Const. amends. V and VI did not afford defendant the right to have a jury determine the factual question of whether there were prior convictions, the court of appeals correctly concluded that it was within the legislature's power to create a statutory right to a jury determination on that factual question. But the legislature was not empowered to expand the role of the jury beyond fact-finders. Defendant had not asked to have a jury determine whether he was previously convicted of two DUIs. He sought to have a jury determine the legal role governing when his conviction took place, whether at the time of pleading guilty or at the time of sentencing. Because defendant's only contention regarding the application of the sentence enhancement was one of law, he had neither a constitutional nor a statutory right to a jury trial regarding his sentence enhancement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant putative father filed paternity proceedings with an affidavit stating his plan to parent his child (that respondent mother planned to give up for adoption) as required by Utah Code section 78-30-4.14(6)(b) (Supp. 2006). A district court found that he waived any rights in relation to his child as he did not strictly comply with the statute. Respondent adoption center's motion to dismiss was granted. The father sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the father contended the district court erred when it concluded that he waived any rights in relation to his child. The supreme court disagreed, finding that the father did not strictly comply with the criteria set forth in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-30-4.14 (Supp. 2006) after he was made aware that the birth mother was in Utah and therefore had no standing to assert any rights in relation to his child. A phone call made by the mother to the father informing him that she was in Utah gave the father knowledge that a qualifying circumstance, the mother's temporary residence in Utah, existed. Because the father had the requisite knowledge of the qualifying circumstance, he was required to comply strictly with Utah law before the latter of the mother's relinquishment of the child or 20 days after the father received notice of the qualifying circumstance in order to retain any rights in relation to the child. Instead, he completed the requirements to establish paternity more than 80 days after he received notice that the mother was in Utah. Therefore, the dismissal was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Utah's Internet Enticement Statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-4-401 (2008), was unconstitutionally vague both facially and as applied to him because it did not put him, nor anyone else, on notice of the point at which the crime was completed. The supreme court found the crime was committed as soon as the defendant solicited or enticed a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity. Variation in enforcement occurred as it was easier to prosecute those individuals who actually arranged a meeting, not because the statute was impermissibly vague. The voluntary termination instruction, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-307 (2003), was inapplicable as there was no evidence to suggest that defendant voluntarily terminated the online conversation prior to the commission of the crime. Defendant was in custody for Miranda purposes because a reasonable person in his position would not have felt free to leave. Defendant was interrogated and the trial court erred in admitting the statements about the computer; however, the error was harmless as there was evidence suggesting defendant's guilt. The proffered expert testimony was not irrelevant but the error in its exclusion was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth District Court, Provo Department, Utah, summarily dismissed appellant resident's defamation action against appellee newspaper editor. The district court found that the resident violated Utah's Citizen Participation in Government Act (Anti-SLAPP Act), Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 78B-6-1401 to -1405 (2008), and awarded the editor attorney fees and costs under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-6-1405(1)(a). The resident appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the editor's speech, although part of a public debate on the eligibility of candidates for office, was not an exercise of his right to influence legislative or executive decision making. Rather, it provided information useful to voters in choosing whom to vote for. The editor's notice was not participation in the process of government and was not protected by the Anti-SLAPP Act. The election notice did not convey a defamatory meaning. While the editor published statements about the resident, there was no evidence that the statements were false. The statements were subject to privilege as they were protected by Utah's public interest privilege. The editor believed that the statements were in concurrence with the city's official interpretation of its ordinances. The election notice was an editorial published by a local newspaper and, in such a context, was not likely to subject the resident to hatred, contempt, or ridicule. The words used by the editor did not constitute defamation as a matter of law. The district court properly awarded fees to the editor under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988(b). The resident's claims were nothing more than conclusory allegations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child began living with a couple, who expressed a desire to adopt the child, after the father was arrested by federal agents on numerous charges. The father argued, on appeal, that the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction to hear a petition to terminate his parental rights because the district court had previously considered a contested adoption petition regarding the child. Because the adoption proceeding in district court had been dismissed, it was proper for the couple and the child's mother to file their petition to terminate the father's parental rights in juvenile court. Moreover, the doctrine of res judicata did not apply to a petition to terminate the father's rights. The juvenile court could consider the father's extensive criminal history and pervasive fraudulent behavior as grounds for termination pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78A-6-508. Further, the father's history of violent behavior was a ground to terminate his rights. The juvenile court also properly determined that termination was in the child's best interests. The juvenile court made sufficient findings to support its determination that the father's did not meet the minimum thresholds for fitness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the trial court erred in holding that punitive damages could not be awarded where plaintiff had unclean hands because application of the equitable doctrine of unclean hands was erroneous when damages were not awarded based on claims based in equity. However, the trial court properly determined that the defendants engaged in a continuing pattern of unlawful behavior under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1602 and Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1605.  Defendants made fraudulent misrepresentations, converted plaintiff's money, and conspired to prevent plaintiff's recovery of her money. These acts had a similar purpose in that they were committed by defendants in order to keep plaintiff's money for their own uses; further, similar parties participated in each act, and all of the acts had the same victim. Because the acts were related in that they were attempts to conceal the theft of plaintiff's money and because the unlawful acts occurred over a five-year period, the acts constituted a continuing pattern of unlawful activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court granted certiorari to consider whether Utah Code Ann. &sect; 34A-2-413(5) (2005) violated the Equal Protection Clauses. The supreme court evaluated the constitutionality of the statute under Utah law, Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 24 and determined that &sect; 34A-2-413(5) violated Utah's uniform operation of laws provision by unconstitutionally singling out and reducing workers' compensation benefits of injured individuals over the age of 65 who qualified for social security retirement benefits. The supreme court declared the offset provision in the statute unconstitutional and reversed and remanded. The employee was injured while working for the employer and the Commission had originally ordered that the employee receive workers' compensation payments of $395 per week. The employer challenged the award, arguing that it needed to be offset pursuant to &sect; 34A-2-413. The appellate court found that the legislature chose a reasonable means to achieve its objective and that the statute survived relational basis review under the Utah Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the father of a juvenile adjudicated delinquent, appealed an order of the Fifth District Juvenile, Cedar City, Utah, that denied his motion to dismiss a contempt finding rendered against him and his motion to vacate his guilty plea to an earlier contempt charge, arguing that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to require a parent of a delinquent child to undergo drug testing in a delinquency proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In delinquency proceedings, the juvenile court ordered the father of the delinquent child to undergo drug testing. When the father failed to comply, the juvenile court found him to be in contempt. On review, the court held that the juvenile court had subject matter jurisdiction over the father under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78A-6-117 (2008). The juvenile court had jurisdiction over the delinquent child and, therefore, had jurisdiction to order the father to comply with reasonable conditions. A condition imposed on a parent in a child delinquency proceeding would be found reasonable if it was not punitive and if there was a nexus between the parent's alleged act, the minor's behavior, and the goal of the order. Even if an order met those criteria, however, it would be deemed unreasonable if it violated the parent's constitutional right. Because juvenile court ordered the father to undergo drug testing in the absence of probable cause to believe that he was using drugs, the order conflicted with the father's established rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV. As such, the order was not a reasonable condition under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78A-6-117(2)(p)(i) and (t) (2008).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the juvenile court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Appellees, a county, a planning commission, a commissioner, and governmental entities, and intervenors, landowners and developers, brought motions suggesting the issues were moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners and developers planned a gated community with a golf course, residential units, and a private ski resort. The plan was approved by the planning commission. The organization filed an administrative appeal to the adoption of the ordinance, but the appeal was denied. The supreme court first addressed the suggestions of mootness. Then, it address the issue of notice and the question of referability. The supreme court held that the issue of referendum was not rendered moot by the completion of the November election. Nevertheless, the claim that the county's posting of a newly revised version of the development agreement less that one full day before the hearing, and the claim that the lack of specificity in the notices rendered the notices insufficient were without merit. The supreme court further concluded the county clearly intended to act legislatively when it enacted the ordinance; therefore, the ordinance could be referred for voter approval at the next general election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In seeking to have the initiative removed from the ballot, the utility relied on Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20A-7-401, which purported to limit the substantive scope of citizen initiatives. However, the court found &sect; 20A-7-401 to be unconstitutional. The court concluded that the initiative was clearly legislative in nature and susceptible to the initiative process. The initiative's supporters sought to amend the county zoning ordinance. Although the underlying motive of the initiative supporters seemed clearly that of putting the utility's conditional use permit to a vote of the people, the initiative itself addressed the overall conditional use permit issuance and revocation ordinance, modifying the framework to be applied to any and all coal-fired electricity generation power facilities seeking a conditional use permit in the county. The court expressed no opinion on the wisdom, worthiness, or wording of the initiative. It was for the voters of the county to determine if and how the measure was to be regarded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (DABC) found appellant private club liable for three statutory violations of the Utah Alcoholic Beverage Control Act. Following a bench trial, the Third District Court, Salt Lake, Utah, adopted the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by the DABC and affirmed its findings and conclusions. The club appealed. The DABC cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club challenged, among other issues, the definition of &quot;intoxication&quot; as applied to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 32A-12-216 (2001) by the DABC Commission and later by the district court in a trial de novo. The DABC argued that the district court wrongly conducted a trial de novo rather than reviewing the record created by the Commission and giving deference to the Commission's conclusion. The instant court concluded that the district court, in conducting a trial de novo, applied both the proper standard and method of review to the Commission's decision. However, the district court and the DABC misinterpreted &sect; 32A-12-216. In determining whether an individual is intoxicated under &sect; 32A-12-216, the instant court held that the phrase &quot;may endanger&quot; as used in the public intoxication statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-9-701(1) (1999), requires circumstantial evidence of a reasonable likelihood of harm, that &sect; 32A-12-216 incorporates the public place/private place distinction in the public intoxication statute, that a private club is a private place within the meaning of the public intoxication statute, and that &sect; 32A-12-216 is not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the district court to consider the club's liability for violating &sect; 32A-12-216.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner failed to show that his counsel was ineffective or that he was prejudiced by any allegedly deficient performance. The post-conviction court committed harmless error by sua sponte granting summary judgment as to petitioner's claim that trial counsel was ineffective by failing to make an opening statement in the penalty phase and that appellate counsel failed to adequately brief and raise relevant issues.

The district court found that the competitor's pop-ups appeared in separate and distinct windows from the merchant's website, bore the competitor's name, and were not labeled as being affiliated with the merchant's website. The court agreed that summary judgment on the unfair competition claim was proper, because the merchant failed to show that the pop-ups were deceptive, infringed a trademark, passed off the competitor's goods as those of the merchant, or were likely to cause confusion. The merchant failed to provide evidence of any material fact that was based upon more than unsubstantiated opinions and conclusions. Absent survey evidence of confusion or actual diversion of customers, the court was entitled to assume that these pop-ups were not unfairly competitive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow asserted that the doctor's care was the cause of her husband's suicide. The doctor sought to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement signed by the husband. On appeal, the court found that the district court's denial of the doctor's motion to compel arbitration was correct because the husband did not have the power to contract away the wrongful death action of his heirs. In addition, in a wrongful death action by heirs, arbitration did not fall into the category of defenses that could be raised by the doctor against the widow merely because it was available as a defense against the decedent. Furthermore, the court determined that neither Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78B-3-421 nor public policy favoring arbitration mandated that the widow be bound to arbitrate. Finally, the court held that the widow could not be required to arbitrate because she was not a third-party beneficiary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Auditing Division of the Utah State Tax Commission taxed the proceeds of a settlement received by petitioner taxpayers, a settlement which resolved a lawsuit in Nevada two years after the taxpayers moved from Utah. The Commission determined that the settlement proceeds were taxable because they related to the sale of assets of an S corporation doing business in Utah. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the taxpayers contended the Commission erred in finding that the settlement was paid in lieu of proceeds the taxpayers should have received from the original sale of a corporation. Because they were not Utah residents at the time of the settlement, the taxpayers contended that Utah lacked jurisdiction to tax the settlement proceeds. The supreme court disagreed and held that the taxpayers' settlement proceeds were not immune from taxation. Applying the &quot;in lieu of&quot; test to determine the character and nature of the settlement proceeds, the supreme court concluded that they were received in lieu of proceeds that the taxpayers should have received from a deemed asset sale of the corporation. The gains recognized from this deemed asset sale constituted Utah source income under Utah Code &sect; 59-10-118(1)(a), which defined business income, and Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-7-114(4), which created a rebuttable presumption that the gain on a deemed sale of assets under an I.R.C. &sect; 338 election constituted business income. They were therefore taxable under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-10-117(2)(d). As such, the settlement proceeds were taxable as Utah source income.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth District Court, American Fork (Utah) denied the motion of appellant corrections officers and appellant prison warden to dismiss appellee prisoner's personal injury claims brought under the prohibition in Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 9 against unnecessarily rigorous treatment of prisoners and arrestees. The officers and the warden appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner's claims arose from injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident while being transported in custody. The prisoner was among a group of inmates being transported by freeway in a van that had working seatbelts. They were handcuffed and shackled and thus unable to buckle their own seatbelts, and the officers refused requests to buckle the inmate's seatbelts. The officer who was driving, and who had buckled his own seatbelt, lost control of the vehicle, which resulted in the prisoner being thrown from the vehicle. At the time of the accident, prison policy required that inmates be in a seatbelt while in transport, a policy that was regularly violated. The warden knowingly disregarded the policy. The court held that on the basis of the pleadings alone, the complaint, if proven true, made sufficient allegations to establish a violation of the unnecessary rigor clause because a flagrant violation of that clause occurred whenever it was established that the nature of the act in question presented an obvious and known serious risk of harm to the arrested or imprisoned person, and knowing of that risk, an official acted without other reasonable justification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and remanded for additional proceedings to determine (1) whether the risk of harm to the prisoner was serious and whether it was obvious and known to the officers and the warden; and (2) if so, what, if any, justification existed for the officers' act, as well as whether the justification was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of the district court's judgment granting appellee the injunction, the court held that it was unable to review the question of whether appellant's conduct met the elements of stalking under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-106.5 because the district court failed to make specific findings of facts with respect to each element of the stalking statute. Therefore, the court remanded the case to the district for entry of findings. The court held that the injunction did not restrain appellant's political speech because it accepted appellee's explanation that paragraph four merely repeated paragraph three of the injunction, which precluded communications from appellant to appellee, not communications by appellant about appellee to others; the restriction was well within the scope of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-3a-101(5) and did not violate the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he failed to return to jail as ordered. During a search incident to arrest, an officer discovered a plastic bag containing methamphetamine residue in defendant's pocket. Defendant was charged with one count of possession of a controlled substance in a drug-free zone with prior convictions, a first degree felony in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-8(2) (Supp. 2004). Defendant argued that because the evidence could sustain a charge of either felony possession or misdemeanor paraphernalia possession, he was entitled to the lesser misdemeanor charge. The reviewing court held that as evidenced by the intention of the Utah Legislature, Utah's felony possession statute and misdemeanor possession of paraphernalia statute did not sufficiently overlap to trigger the protections afforded by the Shondel doctrine. Because the possession of a controlled substance and the possession of drug paraphernalia statutes did not overlap fully, the Shondel doctrine did not apply. The Shondel doctrine was properly directed at the type of overlapping statutes where the statutes were identical.</SPAN></P>

The district court erred in concluding that this case involved the mere interpretation of an initiative petition and not the vindication of a strong or societally important public policy concerning the misuse of the constitutionally-based initiative power and the integrity of a public election. The district court also erred in incorporating into the private attorney general doctrine a requirement that a plaintiff somehow show an inability to pay its own attorney fees in order to be eligible for reimbursement under the doctrine, or that a plaintiff show that its burden was out of proportion to its individual stake in the matter. The successful blocking from the ballot of an unconstitutional initiative petition was an actual and concrete benefit to a large number of citizens and voters.</SPAN></P>

She claimed that the conviction obtained by the guilty pleas was unlawfully induced because she was taking a number of medications. The court of appeals found that error in the Utah R. Crim. P. 11 colloquy during the plea proceeding caused the petition for post-conviction relief to fall within the interests of justice exception to the one-year statute of limitations.

Therefore, defendant could only be convicted of aggravated murder, and his conviction of attempted aggravated murder was vacated. The court held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-202(1)(b) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant because its language was sufficiently clear to give defendant notice that the behavior engaged in was prohibited. Section 76-5-202(1)(b) applied to murders or attempts linked by time, place, or purpose. It was clear that the statute would fully communicate to defendant, as he stood armed with a pistol, waiting for his ex-girlfriend to answer her door early on the morning of June 30, that what could transpire could well be crimes incident to one criminal episode or course of conduct.

The Utah Court of Appeals denied defendant's Utah R. App. P. 23B motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that defendant failed to object to the instructions at trial, but noted that the instructions allowed conviction only upon a finding that the pornographic pictures contained actual, and not virtual, children. The images possessed by defendant were clearly of real children, far below the age of majority. The pictures were being distributed for the purpose of sexual arousal. The definition of &quot;sexually explicit conduct&quot; contained in the jury instructions was not erroneous. The prosecution properly limited the scope within which the jury was to consider the adult exhibits; that they were only there to show defendant's sexual attraction to women, contrary to his testimony. The jury found that each child exhibit depicted a real person younger than eighteen years of age. Enlarging the exhibits was helpful to the jury in determining whether the subjects were real and were they minors. The record required no factual supplementation for a review of ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The State was not required to show that child pornography violated the contemporary community standard, and a showing to the contrary by defense counsel would be irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife filed suit in the Third District Court, Salt Lake (Utah) against defendant, her deceased husband's estate, for personal injuries she suffered in a car accident as a result of the husband's negligence. The court found that the negligence claim was barred by interspousal immunity but that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the statute of limitations was tolled. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that interspousal immunity had been abrogated in Utah with respect to all claims, including claims for negligence. The wife's cause of action accrued on January 2, 2001, but she did not file her negligence claim until January 27, 2005, twenty-five days after four years had elapsed. The estate argued that the wife's claim should have been barred. The supreme court disagreed. The statute of limitations was tolled by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-36, which tolled the statute if a person was &quot;mentally incompetent.&quot; The wife filed four affidavits--one from her mother, two from her sisters, and one from herself. The affidavits stated that the wife was mentally incompetent for a period of at least twenty-five days after the accident. They described the wife's serious condition and her inability to take care of herself. The district court properly determined that the lay affidavits were sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact and send the matter to a jury. The wife had the balance of the four years to bring her negligence claim, regardless of whether she had notice of her claim and an opportunity to pursue it more than three and one-half years earlier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's grant of summary judgment was reversed. The judgment was otherwise affirmed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted for the slitting the throats of the two victims, his sister-in-law and her 15-month-old daughter. On appeal, the court held that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to request that the jury be sequestered because the inmate offered no support for his proposition that reasonable counsel &quot;surely&quot; would have moved to sequester the jury in such a high profile case, and the fact that an initially sympathetic juror was excused did not establish prejudice. The inmate's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the death qualification of the jury was rejected because counsel did in fact move to preclude the death qualification of the jury venire. The inmate's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation was rejected because the inmate presented no proof of evidence tampering or undiscovered exculpatory evidence that would have resulted from a more extensive mitigation investigation. Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor's statement that punishment for the murder of a 15-month-old baby should be greater than that for murdering an adult.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents were involved in a car accident. The mother, who was pregnant, went through the shattered windshield and sustained serious injuries. Her child was born with a brain injury. The parents argued that the child's brain injury was proximately caused by the accident, and they filed a products liability action in federal court based on the failure to use laminated glass in the windshield. The federal court certified two questions regarding this action to the supreme court. In answering the questions, the supreme court determined that the jury should have been instructed as to the presumption established by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-15-6(3) (2002). The jury should have also been instructed that a preponderance of the evidence was sufficient to rebut this presumption. The fact that this same burden was already imposed by common law did not mean that the Utah Legislature intended to impose a higher burden when it enacted &sect; 78-15-6(3). The statute was not rendered a nullity because the presumption highlighted the significance of compliance with federal standards. Finally, the supreme court noted that Utah recognized the &quot;enhanced injury&quot; theory of liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a former employee, sued defendant, her former employer, the Attorney General for the State of Utah, alleging that defendant interfered with her rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The State moved to dismiss, claiming immunity. The Third District Court, Salt Lake (Utah), granted the motion. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the courts that concluded that the self-care provision of the FMLA under 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2612(a)(1)(D) was unconstitutional and an invalid attempt to abrogate states' Eleventh Amendment immunity. Congress' stated purpose in passing the self-care provision of the FMLA was to protect the disabled against discrimination. Because the provision was not clearly directed at remedying past gender discrimination, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Nev. Dep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs did not apply. In addition, Congress failed to establish the requisite history of state discrimination against the disabled necessary to pass prophylactic legislation intended to curb such discrimination. Accordingly, the provision could not rest on &sect; 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and was therefore invalid. The state was immune from plaintiff's suit for money damages.</SPAN></P>

The Department had authority, without a prior determination from the OSC or the Federal Board, to independently assess whether the Hatch Act was violated by an employee with respect to the Department's conflict of interest policy. It was unclear whether the employee's due process issue was satisfactorily resolved and whether the State Board made a new or corrected factual finding regarding the employee's inconsistent treatment, and if so, whether this might be an alternative basis for its reinstatement order.</SPAN></P>

The district court extended liability for the original liability to movant associates. The associates appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university developed a software product, and it entered into a series of licensing agreements with the judgment debtor. Later, the judgment debtor was dissolved; its stock was acquired by a word processing corporation. The consulting firm signed an indemnification agreement with the judgment debtor. On appeal, the supreme court reviewed and rejected the university's latest attempt to satisfy a money judgment from persons and entities other than the judgment debtor. In an earlier opinion, the supreme court had held that the university could not summarily extend liability to the consulting firm for the judgment. Here, the supreme court rejected the university's attempt to collect the judgment from the officers and directors of the judgment debtor and related entities, which were the associates. The university could not pursue the associates for the debt of the judgment debtor using only post-judgment collection procedures. Those procedures did not afford the associates a constitutionally permissible degree of due process of law; therefore, the associates were denied due process of law. Further, the district court erred when it denied the associates' motion to intervene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued, inter alia, that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation. Although the supreme court agreed that trial counsel was ineffective, the error was harmless. Trial counsel did not speak to all of the inmate's immediate family members. He did not obtain the inmate's school records. Further, he did not conduct a thorough investigation into the inmate's mental health, even though the inmate contemplated raising an insanity defense and a doctor indicated that the inmate had exhibited signs of a personality disorder and demonstrated behavior consistent with brain damage. Instead, trial counsel relied exclusively on the sanity evaluations conducted by two court-appointed doctors. Trial counsel's decisions were due to his lack of knowledge of mitigation experts and his belief that all experts were &quot;hired guns&quot; and that it was unethical to use them. However, the error was harmless given the horrendous circumstances of the crime. It was not likely that the jury would have concluded that the mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The Utah Court of Appeals affirmed. Defendant's petition for a writ of certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying action arose when defendant participated in an alleged scheme to defraud a hospital out of payment for medical services when he brought his friend to the hospital, the friend used a false name, and defendant posed as her husband. On review, defendant again contended Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1801 was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. The supreme court found that defendant's knowingly false or fraudulent statements &quot;for the purpose of executing or concealing&quot; a scheme or artifice to defraud another did not enjoy any constitutional protection. Therefore, the supreme court reaffirmed its prior holding that the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad. However, the supreme court agreed with defendant that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1801(1)(e) (2003) was impermissibly vague in all of its applications so as to leave an individual without knowledge of the nature of the activity that was prohibited, and was therefore constitutionally deficient. The supreme court found problematic the language &quot;other than the obtaining of something of monetary value&quot; in that it was unable to determine what activities or conduct this language was intended to encompass.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had entered conditional guilty pleas to two charges of attempted communications fraud under the above provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Misdemeanor charges were originally filed in circuit court, and that court dismissed the charges as exceeding the court's jurisdictional limit.

Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1801 was neither overbroad nor vague. In order to be actionable, the statute required that the communication be made intentionally, knowingly, or with reckless disregard. Further, the statute required that the communication be made in connection with and for the purpose of executing or concealing a scheme or artifice to defraud another, a type of speech not protected by the First Amendment. The court held that not all false speech was criminalized, only speech both knowingly false and part of a scheme to defraud. There was no vagueness in the prohibition against defendant taking money from his victims. Finally, the court held that the district court had jurisdiction over felony charges pursuant to Utah Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, because once the circuit court dismissed the misdemeanor charges, there were no pending charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The district court concluded that defendant's defraudation of his 14 victims was part of a single scheme or artifice. Defendant entered guilty pleas to four counts of attempted communications fraud under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-4-102(3), and he reserved the right to appeal. The divided court of appeals rejected the district court's interpretation. The State petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant represented that he was the owner of a mortgage company. He assured his 14 victims that he could help them refinance their current mortgages. After collecting fees from his victims, defendant disappeared, without fulfilling his promises. The amount of money defendant took from each individual or couple, $ 400 to $ 600, would have made defendant culpable for only a class A misdemeanor offense. Defendant contended that he had defrauded his 14 victims through 11 separate, individual schemes. Therefore, he argued, it would be improper to aggregate the amounts taken from the victims for the purpose of fixing the degree of the offense and then disaggregate the fraudulent acts so that he could be charged with 11 more serious offenses. The supreme court concluded that the district court's interpretation was correct. The supreme court held that conduct that qualified as a &quot;scheme or artifice&quot; under the communications fraud statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1801 (2003), could involve multiple acts, actors, and victims. The acts, however, had to share a sufficient number of common elements to permit a reasonable person to conclude that they were part of a single criminal design.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents argued that the expedited procedures outlined in the appellate rules, and applied by the court of appeals, denied them their constitutional right to a meaningful appeal by precluding full presentation of legal argument to the appellate court. The supreme court found that Utah R. App. P. 55 in no way forbade the inclusion of an argument, and in fact, required one. Because Utah R. App. P. 58 made clear that the court of appeals may render a decision based on the petition without full briefing, counsel would be remiss to omit arguments from that petition, albeit argument in specific, exact, and concise form. The parents were unable to offer any suggestion of how to determine what number of pages would be necessary to vindicate their right to a meaningful appeal. The rules required that the attorney who acted as counsel at trial also prepare the petition. Audio recordings of trial proceedings in juvenile courts were available almost immediately at nominal cost. A fifteen-day time limit provided adequate time to file a petition. An appellate court could decide a case on the merits with only a presentation of the issues along with an appropriate examination of the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred in placing a $ 500 limitation on reimbursable expenses for an investigator in defendant's first degree felony case. The court of appeals concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by focusing on how much an investigator would cost rather than on whether an investigator was necessary. On certiorari review, the supreme court held that the court of appeals erred in reversing defendant's conviction. The Utah Indigent Defense Act, specifically Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-32-305.5, authorized the trial court to assess both the necessity of an investigator and the reasonableness of the expense. This authorization was inconsistent with the court of appeals' decision barring a trial court from considering expense at all. Furthermore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting the initial limitation at $ 500 because the record included no suggestion that a greater initial amount was necessary and no indication that defendant either exhausted the $ 500 or requested more.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court determined that the University was subject to &sect; 63-98-102(5). The University's policy was contractual, not legislative, in nature; therefore, it did not violate the constitutional directive of Utah Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;6. The plain language of Utah Const. art. X, &sect; 4 and prior pronouncements on the issue of university governance compelled the conclusion that the University was subject to legislative control, and therefore was unable to enforce its firearms policy in contravention of state law. Section 4 did not create any new rights in the University. Rather, it perpetuated only those rights enjoyed by the University at the time of statehood. The University was subject to the law of Utah at that time, pursuant to 1892 Utah Laws ch. IX, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the father and mother divorced, the mother and child lived with the mother's parents (one being the plaintiff) until the mother moved into her own home.

Eventually the father and child moved to Florida. The court affirmed, and held that the Statute was not unconstitutional under Troxel because it expressly incorporated the parental presumption. The court also held that the district court constitutionally applied the Statute because the evidence presented clearly and convincingly rebutted the parental presumption incorporated in the Statute. The trial court gave special weight to the father's decisions; visitation between the child and the grandparents had been unreasonably limited or denied; and the district court considered the &quot;substantial relationship&quot; between the child and her grandparents, concluding that the loss of this relationship would be harmful to the child under &sect; 30-5-2(2)(d).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed an interlocutory appeal of bindover orders of the Fifth District, Cedar City (Utah) that reduced the aggravated murder charge to simple murder and denied the State's request to proceed on felony murder charges, concluding that the evidence did not show defendant had the specific intent to kill the victim or that the murder occurred during the commission of a kidnapping as provided in Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 76-5-202(1) and 76-5-203.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State had charged defendant with aggravated murder, kidnapping, theft of an automobile, and theft, but the trial court concluded that the evidence did not support the aggravated murder or felony murder charges. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in refusing to bindover defendant under the aggravated murder statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-202(1), because the State satisfied the appropriate mental state by demonstrating that defendant intentionally &quot;or&quot; knowingly committed the homicide; and presented evidence to show the killing was directly associated with the kidnapping as part of one continuous occurrence. The evidence showed that defendant and another boy beat his group home counselor twice over the head with a baseball bat and stuffed him upside down in a locked closet, and then cut the phone lines and took the key, which delayed others from obtaining help for the victim.  The court also held that the trial court erred in refusing to bind defendant over under the felony murder rule because the State demonstrated that the homicide was accomplished in the course of committing the kidnapping as a predicate offense under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-203(2)(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the trial court's bindover orders that held the evidence was insufficient for the aggravated murder mens rea, for kidnapping as an aggravating factor, and for kidnapping as a predicate offense for felony murder, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court affirmed the trial court's determination that defendant kidnapped the victim, and noted that the &quot;other personal gain&quot; factor had been dropped.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff businesses appealed an order of the Third District Court, Salt Lake (Utah), granting defendant city summary judgment in the businesses' action alleging that the Utah Constitution protected nude dancing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The businesses, which operated nude dancing establishments and a lingerie and novelty store, sued the city after it passed an ordinance, City of South Salt Lake, Utah, Ord. &sect; 5.56.310(G), that prohibited any sexually-oriented business employee from appearing nude before a patron, alleging that it violated Utah Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 15. The district court held that because the provisions of the Utah Constitution that guaranteed Utah citizens' rights to &quot;communicate freely with their thoughts and opinions&quot; did not extend protection to nude dancing in sexually oriented businesses, the city's motion for summary judgment was properly granted. It was widely recognized at the time the Utah Constitution was drafted that obscene speech was one of the exceptions to constitutional freedom of speech protection. Nude dancing, in particular, was criminalized by statutes in effect both before and after the Utah Constitution was ratified. In light of the clear disapprobation the people of Utah demonstrated for activities such as nude dancing, extending free speech protections in the area would run contrary to the intent of the framers of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting the city summary judgment was affirmed as to the parties' claims that nude dancing was protected by the Utah Constitution. The order was reversed as to one party's claim that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, which should have been dismissed without prejudice rather than with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court accepted certiorari from the appellate court (Utah), to consider whether defendant's Batson challenge was timely.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in the case arose from the State's use of its peremptory challenges to exclude female potential jurors from the jury at the trial of defendant. He objected, arguing that the State's use of its peremptory challenges was unconstitutional under Batson. However, he did not raise his Batson challenge until after the trial jury had been empaneled and sworn in and the remainder of the venire dismissed. The supreme court accepted certiorari to consider whether his Batson challenge was timely under those circumstances. It held that a Batson challenge was only timely if raised both before the jury is sworn and before the remainder of the venire was excused. Under firmly established Utah law, a Batson challenge was only timely if it is raised before the jury is sworn. The supreme court took the opportunity to clarify that a Batson objection must also be raised before the venire is dismissed. Accordingly, the supreme court reversed the appellate court's decision and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The district court ordered that the inmate be resentenced, thereby reviving his right to appeal his conviction. The Utah Court of Appeals vacated the district court's judgment. Certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate asserted that he was entitled to relief because of a flawed competency hearing, ineffective assistance of counsel, and a denial of his right to appeal. The inmate acknowledged that he failed to file his petition within the one-year limitations period, but he urged the district court to find that the interests of justice excused that failure. The supreme court concluded that the inmate was not required to proceed under the PCRA to seek reinstatement of his right to appeal. While resentencing a defendant nunc pro tunc was no longer an available option, the district court's reasoning was sound. The inmate's claims were more appropriate for a direct appeal. On remand, the trial court was to conduct an evidentiary hearing where the inmate could present evidence to support his assertions. As to the claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, the record in the post-conviction proceedings revealed almost nothing regarding the district court's justification for proceeding to trial in the inmate's absence and precious little regarding the circumstances surrounding counsel's withdrawal. Finally, resolving the claim of mental incapacitation would require an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals vacating the district court's resentencing order, and it remanded the matter to the district court for further proceedings, with directions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the district court had jurisdiction with respect to defendant's possession or use charges because the existence of a controlled substance in his bloodstream was itself &quot;consumption&quot; of a controlled substance that occurred within the state. The statute in question was Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-2(1)(dd), which included the &quot;consumption&quot; of controlled substances within its definition of practices that were unlawful under the possession or use subsection. The supreme court found that the Legislature had explicitly referred to the existence of controlled substances in the bloodstream in at least eight other statutes. Had the Legislature wanted to include the metabolization of controlled substances as a violation of the possession or use subsection, it would have done so explicitly. The supreme court's analysis of the possession or use subsection was based on the version of the statute under which defendant was charged, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-8(2)(a)(i) (Supp. 1999), and would likely be different if it were to interpret the current version of the statute. The State did not present any support including metabolization within the definition of &quot;consumption.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to subpoena the doctor's patient records in conduction with its investigation that the doctor had committed insurance fraud. The appellate court held that while the trial court erred in concluding that the physician-patient privilege in Utah R. Evid. 506 did not apply in an investigation under the Subpoena Powers Act, it did not grant the doctor extraordinary relief because the appellate court was convinced that the State effectively rebutted the doctor's presumed authority to claim the privilege in this case. It was apparent from the record that the doctor actually sought to claim the privilege for his own benefit and in derogation of his patients' interests. Furthermore, the secrecy order regarding the criminal investigation at issue did not deprive the doctor of any constitutional right under U.S. Const. amend. IV or V because the doctor had abundant knowledge regarding the potential charges against him and because the Subpoena Powers Act required pre-interrogation disclosure of all information necessary to protect a witness's constitutional rights.

App. P. 19, requesting that the supreme court vacate the district court's order that denied the State's motion to allow a child witness to testify outside the defendant's presence via closed-circuit television. Defendant had been charged with six counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child. The alleged victim was his six-year-old daughter. The district court reasoned that such testimony violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The supreme court granted the State's petition and remanded, stating that the district court made an error of law when it held that the child was prevented from testifying via closed-circuit television. The error was egregious because the district court applied an inaccurate constitutional standard in a criminal case. Second, the legal issue was significant and the consequences of denying relief would be severe. The guardian ad litem and the child's therapist presented evidence that the child would not be able to testify in defendant's presence, which would significantly affect the State's ability to prosecute the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District Court, Salt Lake, Utah, denied motions for a preliminary injunction by plaintiffs, Utah Public Employees Association (UPEA) and employees, and granted defendant State's motion for a judgment in its favor on the pleadings on plaintiffs' contention that the 2005 amendments to the Unused Sick Leave Retirement Option Program (Program), Utah Code Ann. &sect; 67-19-14.2, were unconstitutional. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the 2005 amendments to the Program effected an unconstitutional taking of employees' unused sick leave benefits by retroactively devaluing already vested rights. The supreme court noted that because UPEA and the employees had undisputed standing, the ultimate test for the propriety of bringing a facial challenge was in the substantive merits of the claim. Absent clear language regarding or an obvious interpretation of &quot;eligible to receive retirement benefits&quot; in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 67-19-14 and Title 49, the statutory language was ambiguous. State agencies inviting employees to participate in the Program during the course of their state employment constituted an offer by the State. The State intended employees to accept the offer to redeem the hours for unused sick leave only upon retirement. The offer did not lock in the method of pay-out until retirement. The State did not voluntarily undertake an obligation to permit employees to redeem 100% of their unused sick leave hours for medical and life insurance. Because plaintiffs lacked a constitutionally protected property interest in redeeming 100% of their unused sick leave hours, their takings claim failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county sought to exercise its police power to require plaintiff developer to dedicate property for the purpose of widening a major traffic artery adjacent to a subdivision from which the developer sought county approval to build. The Utah Court of Appeals held that the process used to review the propriety of the county's land dedication requirements was flawed. It remanded the case. The instant court granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the developer appealed the county's decision to the district court, the district court chose to take evidence. Grounded however on the plain language of former Utah Code Ann. &sect; 17-27-1001(3)(a) (2001), the court of appeals concluded that the district court exceeded its discretion by taking evidence. That result required the court of appeals to remand the case. The supreme court noted that the latter procedural quandary had since been resolved by Utah Code &sect; 17-27a-801, passed by the Utah Legislature in 2005. Section 17-27a-801 gave clear direction to a district court reviewing a land-use decision that if there was no record, the district court could call witnesses and take evidence. Further, &sect; 17-27a-801 applied retroactively since it did not &quot;enlarge, eliminate or destroy&quot; substantive rights. Thus, the supreme court reversed the court of appeals' holding that the district court erred when it received evidence. Finally, while noting that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 17-27a-507 (Supp. 2005) was not available for retroactive application to the instant case, the supreme court concluded that the trial court was to conduct a rough proportionality review (based on the Nollan/Dolan test).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals' decision as to the trial court's receipt of evidence in the case was reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county sought to require the developer to dedicate property to widen a road adjacent to a residential subdivision for which the developer sought county approval. The court of appeals held that the trial court erred in not applying the Nollan/Dolan heightened-scrutiny rough proportionality test to review the propriety of the county's land dedication requirements. On review, the court held that the rough proportionality test was the proper tool to measure the lawfulness of the dedication because the legislature had intervened by enacting Utah Code Ann. &sect; 17-27a-507 (Supp. 2005), which codified the policy decision to require rough proportionality treatment of all development exactions, both those emanating from the application of uniform land-use provisions, like the county's local ordinance, and from individual adjudicative decisions. However, the court held that the court of appeals erred in holding that the trial court erred when it received evidence because the legislature had enacted Utah Code Ann. &sect; 10-9a-801 (Supp. 2005), which stated that a district court reviewing a land-use decision could call witnesses and take evidence if there was no record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with three first-degree felonies: aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and theft. The state sought a gang enhancement under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-20.1 (2003). After defendants pleaded guilty, the district court granted their motions requesting a one-degree reduction of the aggravated robbery charges for sentencing purposes under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-3-402, reducing defendants' offenses from first-degree felonies with enhancements to second-degree felonies without enhancements. The state sought extraordinary relief, arguing that the district court violated the prohibition against two-degree reductions absent the prosecution's approval as required under &sect; 76-3-402. The court agreed and nullified the reductions. Reducing a first-degree felony with a gang enhancement to a second-degree felony without an enhancement amounted to a two-degree reduction from the level of the charged offense and was impermissible absent consent from the prosecutor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff residents filed an action against defendant students in the Third District Court, Salt Lake, Utah, in which they alleged civil conspiracy, assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and trespass to real property. The district court denied one student's motion for judgment on the pleadings to resolve the allocation of fault before the case went to trial. The student requested an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the central fact of the case was the status of the students as alleged intentional tortfeasors under the Utah Liability Reform Act (LRA), Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 78-27-37 to -43 (2002). Two students argued that the LRA preempted the common law doctrine of civil conspiracy. The appellate court found that in a conspiracy that resulted in tort liability, the cause of action for which the co-conspirators were ultimately held liable was not the tort resulting in the harm, but for the conspiracy that led to the harm. These were separate and distinct causes of action, and the LRA could not reach the domain of civil conspiracy. The LRA did not preempt civil conspiracy because even if it applied to intentional torts, such a determination would not implicate conspiracy due to its nature as a cause of action distinguishable, independent, and unrelated to tort law. Whether the LRA applied to intentional torts remained an open question. The appellate court stated that the legislature may, if it elected, answer it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile pled guilty in the Third District Court, Salt Lake Department, Utah, to second-degree felony theft on the condition that he be permitted to challenge his bindover order. After reinstating his appeal, the court of appeals reversed the bindover order, finding that defendant had met the required retention factors under the Serious Youth Offender Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-602 (1996). The State petitioned for writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had asked the trial court to quash its bindover order. The State argued that as a final and appealable order, the only proper venue to challenge the bindover was the court of appeals; however, the trial court judge indicated that it had jurisdiction to address the motion to quash. Defendant filed a motion with the court of appeals to voluntarily dismiss his appeal, but the trial court issued a memorandum decision holding that it did not have jurisdiction to review the bindover order. The court of appeals concluded that defendant had not knowingly and voluntarily withdrawn his appeal due to the trial court's misleading assurances of the retention of some right to appeal. The supreme court held that the court of appeals acted properly when it reinstated defendant's appeal because the Utah Constitution provided appellate courts with jurisdiction to protect criminal defendants' right to appeal. The supreme court concluded that because defendant's waiver of his right to appeal was involuntary, denying his request for reinstatement of that right would have constituted a violation of Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 12, so the court of appeals was obligated to provide him with an appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate appealed his conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Despite the fact that his attorney requested relevant portions of the record be filed with the court of appeals, a clerical error prevented that from happening, and defendant's conviction was affirmed.

The court of appeals reversed the trial court's dismissal of that petition and treated the petition as a writ of coram nobis predicated on a claim for relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The state supreme court reversed the decision of court of appeals and held that an affirmance of conviction attributable to the ineffective assistance of counsel did not constitute a denial of the right to appeal. Thus, the court of appeals improperly treated the inmate's petition as a writ of coram nobis as the inmate had exhausted his right to appeal, and the appropriate avenue for relief was under Utah's Post-Conviction Remedies Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-35a-102 (Supp. 2004).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company, which distributed culinary water within the county, claimed that the county used a new ordinance regarding concurrency ratings of culinary water companies to ensure that the water service district would have a competitive advantage in seeking new water connections. The court held that because antitrust laws were to be narrowly construed, the term &quot;municipality&quot; in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-915(1)(f) was not ambiguous. In analyzing the exemption relying on federal caselaw for guidance, the court found that the district court erred in concluding that for an activity to satisfy the &quot;authorized or directed&quot; requirement in &sect; 76-10-915(1)(f) it was necessary only that a political subdivision act pursuant to general state statutes. The anticompetitive activities alleged by plaintiffs were not a foreseeable result of the statutory scheme in that the statutory scheme did not a reveal state policy of allowing counties to displace competition with a special service district. Accordingly, the county defendants would not be entitled to the exemption because their alleged anticompetitive conduct was not authorized or directed by state law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rejected the argument that the interest of justice exception applied. The inmate then sought review.

The inmate had a non-frivolous claim under Utah R. Civ. P. 65C that may have proven meritorious, as well as good reason for filing his petition late.

After the State filed its answer, the WCF moved for summary judgment, and the State then moved to dismiss, or, in the alternative, for a judgment on the pleadings. The Third District Court, Salt Lake, Utah, granted the WCF's motion. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the WCF was created by the State and that the State exercised all the incidents of ownership over the WCF. First, the State contended that the WCF was a state governmental entity because an earlier version of the WCF statute described it as an independent state agency. Second, it asserted that the Injury Fund, an entity separate from the WCF, was a public fund; therefore, it was owned by the State. Finally, the State contended that the WCF policyholders had no ownership interest in the WCF and that the right to control, use, lease, or to otherwise dispose of the assets of the WCF could only be exercised by the State. The appellate court rejected these arguments. The State had no managerial, financial, or operational control of the WCF. The same was true for the WCF's assets, and the Injury Fund. The legislature had deleted statutory language for which the State attempted to argue presented validity. The WCF was private in ownership according to the definition of quasi-public corporation in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63E-1-102(8). If the State were to appropriate the assets of the WCF, the State's action would constitute a taking of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the district court's decision, and it reaffirmed its earlier decisions, which held that assets belonged to the WCF policyholders and not to the State.</SPAN></P>

He entered into a plea bargain in exchange for the State's charging and sentencing concessions. The trial court held that &sect; 77-13-6(2)(b)'s 30-day time limit deprived it of jurisdiction to consider the motion to withdraw. The high court agreed. It rejected the inmate's contention that &sect; 77-13-6(2)(b) violated the Utah and U.S. Constitutions. Section 77-13-6(2)(b) did not violate the open courts provision, Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11, or the Due Process Clause, because a defendant could still seek post-conviction relief in state court after the 30 days expired. It did not violate the Separation of Powers provision, Utah Const. art. V, &sect; 1, as motions to withdraw pleas, unlike habeas corpus petitions, were not matters vested exclusively in the judicial branch. The relief provided by &sect; 77-13-6 to tardy plea withdrawal applicants through the Utah Post-Conviction Relief Act was adequate to justify the disparate treatment of defendants who filed applications after the 30-day time limit expired; therefore, &sect; 77-13-6(2)(b) did not violate the uniform operation of laws provision, Utah Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, injured students and the parents and estates of deceased students, appealed a judgment of the Third District, Salt Lake (Utah), which granted defendant school district's motion for summary judgment and which dismissed plaintiffs' claims with prejudice. The district court found the cap in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-34, which limited the damages recoverable in actions against the state or its political subdivisions, to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students went on a debate team trip out of town. The assistant debate team coach lost control of one of the vans on the return trip. Several students were injured and two died. Recognizing its liability for the coach's negligence, the district and its insurer entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs, agreeing to pay the maximum amount recoverable under the Utah Governmental Immunity Act. Plaintiffs reserved the right to challenge the constitutionality of the Act. The court found that the transportation of a student debate team did not fall outside the realm of the district's core activities. Because the Act implicated neither a fundamental right nor a right protected by the open courts clause, Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11, the rational basis level of scrutiny governed the court's analysis of plaintiffs' state equal protection and due process claims. The court concluded that the cap did not violate state due process and uniform operation of laws provisions or Utah Const. art. XVI, &sect; 5, which guaranteed the right to recover damages for injuries resulting in death. Finally, the court determined that the damages cap did not violate the federal equal protection guarantee.</SPAN></P>

A warrants check revealed there was a warrant for defendant. Defendant was arrested and the officer discovered drugs in a search incident to that arrest. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress. The court of appeals reversed. On appeal, the State argued that the court of appeals erred in concluding that the search was unlawful because the officer did not have a reasonable suspicion for initially detaining defendant. The court held that defendant's detention was constitutionally justified because the officer possessed reasonable suspicion that crime was afoot and that defendant, the sole individual he observed in the area, was connected to the crime. The court also concluded that the officer acted within the permissible scope of the detention when he conducted a warrants check that could potentially supply information relevant to the investigation that gave rise to defendant's detention.</SPAN></P>

They arrived at the offending residence early in the morning. From a location in the driveway, the officers peered through a fence and saw two apparently underage males drinking alcohol. The officers then entered the backyard through a gate, and obtained a clear view into the back of the house. The officers saw four adults restraining one juvenile. The juvenile broke free, swung a fist, and struck one of the adults. Two officers then opened the screen door and &quot;hollered&quot; to identify themselves. When no one heard them, they entered the kitchen. The officers subsequently arrested the adults, the three defendants. The three defendants were charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, disorderly conduct, and intoxication. The three defendants filed a motion to suppress. The trial court granted the motion and the appellate court affirmed. On the city's petition for certiorari review, the state supreme court found that exigent circumstances did not exist to justify the officers' warrantless entry into the kitchen without knocking, and, thus, the motion to suppress was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate argued that the substantial compliance standard found in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20A-1-404(1)-(2) (2003) governed the controversy and should have been applied. The appellate court disagreed, holding that all candidates had to strictly comply with Utah Code Ann. &sect; 10-3-208. As there were two independent sets of regulations, the appellate court would not apply provisions of the Election Code to &sect; 10-3-208 absent an indication that such was the legislative intent. The language, purpose, and structure of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 10-3-208 required strict compliance. Candidates were unambiguously required to file financial disclosure statements seven days before the election. The candidate was required to file these statements by 5:00 p.m. on October 28. Because she did not file her statement until October 29, she did not strictly comply with the plain meaning of the statute, and the city recorder correctly directed city elections officials to remove her name from the ballot. The appellate court would not consider constitutional questions where the candidate did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances. The candidate was not a prevailing party and was not entitled to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The District Court, Fourth District, Provo, Utah, granted summary judgment to the city. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A zoning ordinance, designed to ease student housing shortages, allowed owners of single family homes to rent out apartments. Concerned that absentee landlords did little to address congestion and nuisance problems, the city enacted &sect; 14.30.030(2), which allowed only occupying owners to rent out apartments. The supreme court rejected the owners' challenges to the amendment. As non-occupying owners were not prevented from renting their homes, only from renting accessory apartments -- an activity that would not be permitted at all in the absence of the original ordinance -- the restriction was justified as a means of balancing the city's interests in accommodating student housing needs while preserving the character of single-family residential neighborhoods. The amendment was thus within the city's zoning power and did not violate the uniform operation of laws provision of Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 24.  Even assuming the amendment placed an indirect restraint on alienation of property, the supreme court upheld it as reasonably necessary to protect the city's legitimate interest in preserving the character of the affected neighborhoods. The amendment did not burden the right to travel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mandamus petitions challenged the constitutionality of former Utah Code Jud. Admin.

The court of appeals concluded that Utah's two-tier justice court system, which allowed an accused to exercise the right to appeal by de novo trial in district court but did not vacate a conviction pending appeal, was not constitutionally deficient. The court, in affirming, observed that a defendant convicted in justice court proceedings could not receive a harsher penalty if convicted in a trial de novo and could not receive multiple punishments in both a justice court and a district court for the same offense. A defendant who requested a de novo trial was not placed twice in jeopardy but obtained two opportunities to secure an acquittal. The procedures for obtaining a stay had no impact on the ability to appeal a conviction under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-5-120(1) (2002) and did not burden the right to appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retirees argued that not only were discriminatory tax exemptions precluded for state retirement benefits, but also for any retirement benefits increases designed to compensate state employees for the loss of such exemptions.

Increasing the state retirees' retirement benefits would be subject to federal taxation. Utah taxed all retirement benefits equally. The benefits increase was provided for all Utah state retirees, not just those residing in Utah. The benefits increase provided all qualified state retirees a three percent increase in benefits, regardless of how much they lost when the exemption was eliminated, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 49-11-701(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents sued defendant corporation for various claims arising from the corporation's placement of a juvenile in their home who subsequently molested their three-year-old child. The Third District Court, Salt Lake (Utah) granted summary judgment for the corporation, holding that the parents' claims were barred by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25.1. The parents, on behalf of their minor son, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the parents sued the corporation, the corporation moved for summary judgment, claiming Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25.1 barred the parents' claims. The corporation argued the statute limited civil actions for sexual abuse of a child to abuse by a &quot;living person,&quot; not a corporate entity. The trial court granted the corporation's motion to amend its answer and its motion for summary judgment. The parents appealed. Although the corporation's amendment pressed the outer limits of timeliness, no prejudice to the parents was apparent, and the trial court acted within its discretion in granting the corporation's motion to amend to include the argument regarding &sect; 78-12-25.1(5). The parents' claim was for negligent placement, a cognizable cause of action appropriately pled. The claim was for negligent performance of a duty to exercise due care in placing a child in a foster home. A corporate entity could be liable for negligently placing children in circumstances where it knew or should have known they were at risk of being abused or perpetrating abuse. Civil actions for negligent placement were not affected by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-25.1, so it should not have barred the parents' claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorists were injured by an employee of the federal government who had been drinking at a military base. The motorists filed suit, claiming that the employee was negligently served alcohol in violation of the Act. The district court certified a question to the court, and the court found that the Act was a strict liability statute. The court further held that no negligence cause of action for the sale of alcohol to people who caused injury to others while under the influence was recognized in the state. There was no common law basis to support a third-party negligence claim against dramshops. Application of the same principle led the court to hold that the proscription by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, specifically Utah Code Ann. &sect; 32A-14-101 (2003), against furnishing alcoholic beverages to intoxicated persons did not give rise to a claim in common law negligence in the factual setting presented here. The court rejected the constitutional claim under Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 11, as there was no existing common law claim that the legislature displaced when it codified the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother contended that the limitation that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-14-7.1 (2002) placed on the quality of life damages violated the protections of Utah Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 11, 24, 7, 10, and Utah Const. art. V, &sect; 1. The court held: (1) it could not be concluded that the cap on the quality of life damages was arbitrary or unreasonable, in that it was targeted to control costs in one area where costs might be controllable. Therefore, the damage cap was designed to eliminate a social or economic evil; (2) the cap substantially furthered and was reasonably necessary to the legislative goal of decreasing health care costs; (3) while the cap discriminated against medical malpractice victims with the most severe noneconomic injuries, it did so reasonably, given the statute's purpose; (4) as to the mother's right to a jury trial, the jury fulfilled its role when it determined the amount of diminishment of the child's quality of life. However, the law did not provide for such an award, and the trial court was compelled to reduce the verdict; (5) the cap represented the law to be applied, not an improper usurpation of jury prerogatives. Consequently, it did not violate separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

He argued on appeal that Utah's bigamy statute (Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-7-101 (1999)), violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; Utah's bigamy statute was unconstitutionally vague; and, the trial court erred in applying Utah's unsolemnized marriage statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 30-1-4.5 (1999). The appellate court held: Utah's bigamy statute did not violate defendant's federal constitutional right to free exercise of religion; Utah's bigamy statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct; and, the State's use of Utah's unsolemnized marriage statute to establish a legal marriage between defendant and one of the women was not inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of theft of an automobile and was paroled. After his release, defendant absconded from the correctional center and the State (the board of pardons and parole) issued a warrant to retake defendant. While at large, defendant committed aggravated robbery, and his parole was subsequently revoked. The Third District Court, Sandy, Utah, enjoined the board from issuing retaking warrants. The board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on review was whether the Utah Constitution authorized the legislature to enact Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-27-11(3) (2003), which empowered the board to issue warrants to retake parolees believed to have violated parole. The appellate court held that it did, finding that the constitutional interest at stake in the issuance of retaking warrants did not merit including them in the category of a &quot;core judicial function.&quot; While the issuance of a retaking warrant was not as ministerial as, for example, filling out forms, it was clearly less demanding of due process safeguards than granting or revoking parole. The purpose of a retaking warrant was not to grant or deny rights to a parolee; rather, its practical purpose was to initiate the process of revoking parole, a duty which mandated a majority action. Where a warrant-issuing board member could ask the department of corrections to determine if there was probable cause to detain a parolee, and probable cause had to be found in order to further detain the parolee, the &quot;minimal inquiry&quot; requirements of due process of both the Utah and the United States Constitutions were met. As such, &sect; 77-27-11(3) was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

Two subcontractors named the construction company as a third-party defendant. The owners moved for summary judgment, arguing the liens were improper under the Residence Lien Restriction and Lien Recovery Fund Act (the Act), Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 38-11-102(20) and -107(1) (2001), because the units constituted &quot;residences.&quot; The trial court granted the motions, reasoning the units were &quot;residences&quot; under the Act, concluding this determination was compelled by the Condominium Ownership Act. The construction company appealed. The trial court was reversed because neither the Lien Restriction Act nor the Condominium Ownership Act prevented filing of the liens when a condominium was part of a 10-unit development.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A neglected minor became subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. The Fourth District, Provo (Utah) terminated the minor's parent's parental rights. Respondents, a paternal aunt and uncle, and petitioner maternal grandparents sought custody. The court allowed adoption by the aunt and uncle, but ordered the maternal grandparents' visitation restored. The court of appeals reversed. The grandparents sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals reversed the juvenile court's order restoring visitation rights to the grandparents on the grounds that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the pre-adoption visitation order. This case came under the juvenile court's jurisdiction in accordance with Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-104(1)(c) (Supp. 2003) because the child was a minor who had been neglected. Pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-407 (2003), the juvenile court terminated the parental rights of both of the child's biological parents. At that point, the juvenile court continued to have exclusive original jurisdiction over the child under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-121(1) (Supp. 2003). However, after the adoption decree, there were no new findings that brought the child within the juvenile court's jurisdiction. Therefore, the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the pre-adoption visitation order because the decree of adoption superseded the order as a matter of law. The reviewing court expressly held that the Utah Code did not permit conditional adoptions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant non-profit organization challenged several provisions of the newly-amended initiative statute, contending that Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 20A-7-201, 20A-7-202, and 20A-7-205 (2003) were not retroactively applicable to its initiative or, in the alternative, that all of the challenged provisions were unconstitutional. The Third District, Salt Lake (Utah), granted appellee State's cross-motion for summary judgment. The organization appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court also granted the State's motion to dismiss the organization's challenge to two of the provisions of the initiative statute that the State had not sought to apply to the organization's initiative. The court affirmed the dismissal, stating that the organization was not entitled to contest the constitutionality of those provisions. In evaluating the constitutionality of the remaining three provisions, the court concluded that legislative enactments challenged directly under Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, which granted to the people the right to pass legislation by initiative, were not subject to heightened scrutiny review. Such enactments had to be reasonable and reasonably tend to further a legitimate legislative purpose. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the Senate District Requirement under &sect; 20A-7-201(2)(a)(ii), the Signature Removal Provision under &sect; 20A-7-205(3), and the One-Year Requirement under &sect; 20A-7-202(4) were reasonable, regulatory provisions that furthered legitimate legislative interests. Additionally, the provisions did not offend free speech rights under the Utah or United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was charged with two counts of aggravated murder. The second murder charge related to the fact that the victim was pregnant at the time of the murder. Before the district court, the inmate argued that the death of the unborn child was improperly used as an aggravating factor. Moreover, he contended that the second count of murder was not warranted. After his motions were denied, the inmate entered a guilty plea to one count of aggravated murder. The inmate did not seek direct review, but filed a petition for post-conviction relief. When the petition was denied, the inmate appealed. In affirming, the court determined that most of the inmate's issues were barred by the Utah Post-Conviction Remedies Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 78-35a-101 to -304 (2002) because the same issues were presented to the district court, and no appeal was filed. The court also rejected the inmate's argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction to take his plea based on defects in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 75-5-202(1)(b) (2002). Finally, the inmate did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel since the decision to accept the plea was tactical based on a lack of relevant case law on the subject.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently the city council enacted resolution no. 03-34, which called for a special election in which the electorate was given the opportunity to vote on a proposal to replace the council-mayor form of government with the council-manager form. The mayor opposed abandonment of the council-mayor form. The city council sued, seeking declaratory relief. The mayor moved to dismiss and counterclaimed. The trial court rejected his claims, found the actions of the city council lawful, and ordered the election mandated by the resolution to proceed. The mayor appealed. This court held the resolution was properly enacted. This outcome was mandated by the application of statutes relating to municipal governance and by the wisdom imparted by the constitutions of the United States and of Utah--that the power to alter fundamental institutions of government rested in the legislature and the people, and not in the executive branch. This court also held that the statutes providing notice to the electorate were not an unconstitutional violation of the people's fundamental right to vote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lawyer filed an amended petition in the Fourth District, Provo Department, Utah, for readmission to the practice of law. The trial court held that because the lawyer did not graduate from an American Bar Association (ABA)-accredited law school, he was unable to sit for the bar examination. The lawyer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lawyer graduated from a law school that was unaccredited by the ABA. He later passed the California Bar Exam and was admitted to practice law in Utah based on his good standing with the California Bar. After he was disbarred in Utah, he unsuccessfully sought readmission. The lawyer argued that allowing disbarred applicants who graduated from ABA-approved law schools to sit for the exam based on competency evidenced by that graduation was unfair to him because he was originally admitted under other rules, which did not require his graduation from an approved school, but instead demonstrated competency by recent practice in another state. The supreme court held that the Utah Rules of Lawyer Discipline and Disability and the Utah Rules Governing Admission had to be read in conjunction with one another when applied to disbarred applicants petitioning for readmission to the Utah Bar. The supreme court further held that requiring that petitioners for readmission graduate from an ABA-approved law school, even if the petitioner was previously admitted without meeting the graduation requirement, was a constitutionally permissible method of determining competence.</SPAN></P>

The Commission had originally suspended the fine, then vacated the suspension and reinstated the fine at a reduced amount. The company also filed a motion to strike the Commission's brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission assessed a fine against the company for improperly charging long distance rates for calls made to local area cellular prefixes in violation of the company's tariff. The Commission had suspended the fine subject to compliance with its order, but vacated the suspension after the company failed to comply. Thereafter, a reduced fine was imposed. On review, the court affirmed in part. The court held that the Commission was an independent agency and had been granted the authority under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 54-1-6 (2000) to employ independent counsel to aid it in performing the powers, duties, and functions committed to it be the legislature. Thus, the Commission's independent counsel was authorized to represent the Commission and the court rejected the company's argument to the contrary. The fine assessed by the Commission was not criminal and was not assessed in violation of due process principles. However, the court found that the Commission failed to introduce clear and convincing evidence that the company continued violating its tariff for a certain period of time. The court ruled that the company could only be fined for certain billing cycles, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the record did not contain relevant billing statements necessary to compute the fine, the court affirmed the fine in part, affirmed the vacation of the fine's suspension, and remanded for further proceedings.

Defendant appealed, arguing that &sect; 76-9-201 was unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. The Utah Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant challenged his conviction, he argued that &sect; 76-9-201 was unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Utah Constitution. The court of appeals found that the particular provision most applicable to the defendant's conduct, the unwanted calls provision of &sect; 76-9-201(1)(b), was not overbroad because there was no right to audibly invade another's home or place of business by telephone ring in an attempt to commandeer her listening ear when she has affirmatively expressed a desire to be left alone. Accordingly, the court of appeals affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant did not challenge that ruling. However, the city petitioned for review of the court of appeals' decision declaring that the first portion of &sect; 76-9-201(1)(b), the repeated calls provision, was unconstitutionally overbroad. The court vacated that portion of the court of appeals' decision, stating that once the court of appeals upheld the unwanted calls provision, it should have held that defendant had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the repeated calls provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals' affirmance of defendant's conviction under the unwanted calls provision was correct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with killing his former wife and her unborn child. He challenged the constitutionality of Utah's criminal homicide and aggravated murder statutes, contending that he could not be prosecuted for killing the unborn child or charged with aggravated murder based on that killing. The court found no merit in defendant's vagueness challenge, concluding that the term &quot;unborn child&quot; in the criminal homicide statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-201(1) (1999), provided sufficient notice to enable ordinary people to understand what conduct was statutorily prohibited. Section 76-5-201(1) expressly included an unborn child within its definition of a human being, and the clear meaning of the term encompassed a human being at any stage of development in utero. Moreover, the term did not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement because its meaning was readily ascertainable. The terms &quot;another&quot; and &quot;persons&quot; in the aggravated murder statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-202(1)(b), were not unconstitutionally vague as applied to an unborn child. The court declined to consider an equal protection argument because defendant's petition failed to raise the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees brought an action to quiet title to certain water rights. The water company counterclaimed, asking the trial court to adjudicate its water right as the senior right. The water company filed a pre-trial motion seeking to bar any objections to the validity of its diligence claim based on its discovery that appellees' objection to the state engineer's proposed determination had been filed after the end of the 90-day objection period required by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 73-4-11(1989). The trial court denied the motion and ruled in favor of appellees. The trial court disregarded the state engineer's proposed determination, which gave senior priority to the water company. The court vacated, stating that the trial court erred in determining that it had jurisdiction to hear the quiet title action outside of the general adjudication proceedings. While the state engineer was an executive officer and his or her findings were not binding on courts of law, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 73-4-12 mandated that courts enter judgment in accordance with the proposed determination of the state engineer when the proposed determination had not been contested within the statutorily-mandated period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filled five prescriptions for fenfluramine and phentermine (fen-phen). The pharmacy offered one-a-day capsules of fen-phen, which was a compound the pharmacist mixed. The pharmacist testified that neither he nor the pharmacy ever tested the safety or efficacy of the compounded drug. The essential question on appeal was whether the conduct of the pharmacist transcended pharmaceutical practice, and became that of a pharmaceutical drug manufacturer. The supreme court concluded that the all prescription drugs should be classified as unavoidably dangerous in design. The appellate court found, however, that much of the pharmacy's practices in this case fell well within acceptable guidelines. The pharmacy's only act that might have run afoul of certain prohibitions was the pre-prescription compounding. The appellate court did not find the distribution of sample one-a-day fen-phen capsules to local physicians problematic. For a pharmacy to cross the line and become a manufacturer, there must be evidence of large-scale compounding activity. The only remaining grounds for the patient's claims was negligence. The patient, however, could not make out a complete negligence claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the district court's decision to dismiss the patient's claims, although on different grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlords sued defendants, county, commissioners, and treasurer, for property tax refunds under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-1321 (2000), alleging that the county assessed a double tax on leasehold improvements by taxing both tenants and landlords. The Third District, Salt Lake (Utah), dismissed the claim because the landlords did not follow the procedures under Utah Code Ann. 59-2-1004 (2000), which governed the claim. The landlords appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the landlords' assertion that the assessor's appraisal practices resulted in double taxation of leasehold improvements stated a claim under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-1321 (2000), which allowed refunds of taxes &quot;paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected.&quot; The county claimed that the claim challenged the valuation of property which required them to file a claim with the board within 30 days under Utah Code &sect; 59-2-1004 (2000). For a taxpayer to receive a refund under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-1321 (2000), the taxpayer needed to point to a specific double payment, error, or illegality that was readily apparent from county records. If the illegality was in dispute, the taxpayer needed first to pay under protest before he had standing to challenge the tax in court under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-1327 (2000). The landlords' claim did not fit within the scope of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-1321 (2000). The court rejected the argument that the claim fit under the &quot;paid more than once&quot; clause, and nothing indicated an erroneous or illegal assessment of their property. Clearly, they had not alleged an error of fact or law that was readily apparent from county records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city sought injunctive relief against defendant business and defendant business owner. The Third District, Salt Lake, Utah, entered a temporary restraining order that prohibited the business owner from operating the business that sold sexual items. The trial court subsequently issued a permanent injunction against the business. The business appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner set up a boutique, selling lingerie and novelty items. In his application for a business license, the business owner failed to mention that he intended to sell sexual devices. He was admonished to apply for a sexually oriented business (SOB) license. Later, a city enforcement officer found sexual gratification devices. On appeal, the narrow question presented was whether a municipality might require an SOB to complete a different application then a nonsexually oriented business. First, the supreme court determined that there was no constitutional right to be free from classifications. The supreme court next found that the business owner lacked standing to challenge the ordinance's constitutionality. The ordinance, here, threatened no restriction whatsoever, save for the issuance of a different business license. Nevertheless, the supreme court analyzed the constitutional arguments. The supreme court determined that there was no communicative purpose in the products. The items sold, at best, were symbolic speech. Moreover, the doctrine of prior restraint was inapplicable. Finally, injunctive relief was an appropriate remedy.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was driving with only a vest n, in March with the windows down. Defendant refused to allow a search of the car and he subsequently failed field sobriety tests. His passenger then admitted to drugs in the car. On appeal the court held that the motion to suppress should have been granted because the application for the vehicle checkpoint was too broad to be valid under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-23-104 (1999). The checkpoint at issue was purported in the application to be a drivers license checkpoint. However, the checkpoint plan included several purposes, including an undefined cursory review for violations regarding exterior lights and other safety devices. The court held that the discretion allowed to officers by such a description was inherently unreasonable under Utah. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, because there was also no guidance to assure that such checks were consistent across all vehicles. Moreover, pretextual checkpoint stops were impermissible under the same constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>
