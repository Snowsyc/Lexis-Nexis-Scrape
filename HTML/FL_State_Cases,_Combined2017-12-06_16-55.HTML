<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, attempted sexual battery with a deadly weapon or force likely to cause serious personal injury, and burglary of a dwelling while armed. The Circuit Court in and for Palm Beach County, Florida, sentenced him to death pursuant to the jury's recommendation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stabbed a 14-year-old girl 18 times and sexually assaulted her. His first conviction was reversed on appeal. In the appeal from his second conviction, the supreme court held that, as he presented no new evidence, the law of the case doctrine barred him from re-arguing that his confession was not voluntary and should have been suppressed because he had invoked his right to remain silent. Further, the record showed that his confession was voluntary, as he had been Mirandized many times, and had not been threatened or coerced; as his statement to police, &quot; I don't want to talk about it,&quot; was equivocal, they had not been required to end their questioning. Evidence of the multiple stab wounds, and defendant's desire to inflict pain and fear, supported the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator. Evidence that he had carefully planned the crime supported the cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravator. The death sentence was proportionate in light of the aggravators, including his other conviction for a similar murder. Neither Florida's death penalty statute nor the aggravating factor of murder in the course of a specified felony were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate had been convicted of first-degree murder and armed burglary and sentenced to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. The Circuit Court in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida, denied the inmate's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion for postconviction relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate broke into his former girlfriend's home and stabbed her to death. He argued that trial counsel should have more thoroughly investigated mitigating evidence about his personal history and mental health. The circuit court found that (1) he waived presentation of mitigating evidence and made it difficult for counsel to obtain such evidence, (2) he did not suffer from a brain injury, (3) counsel's decision not to present evidence of the inmate's drug use or poor upbringing due to its potential to adversely affect the jury was reasonable, and (4) the alleged additional mitigating evidence was essentially the same as evidence presented at the penalty phase. The supreme court agreed that the inmate failed to show the outcome would have been different had the proposed mitigating evidence been presented. As to the habeas petition, appellate counsel was not ineffective for not raising unpreserved claims regarding witness testimony and prosecutorial comments because no fundamental error occurred, or by failing to include with the appellate record the transcript of a hearing in which the inmate complained of trial counsel's representation. The death sentence was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. The Circuit Court, Hillsborough County, Florida, denied in part his successive motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, from which the inmate appealed. Appellee State cross-appealed the postconviction court's order granting the inmate a new penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate strangled his girlfriend's teenage daughter. The supreme court held the postconviction court's summary denial of the inmate's Brady claim was proper; either the undisclosed documents were not Brady material because they were neither favorable to the inmate nor suppressed, or he failed to show he was prejudiced by the lack of disclosure. The inmate's motion for DNA testing was properly denied, as there was no issue of the identity of the decedent, and any DNA samples obtained would have been contaminated due to the location of the remains and would not prove the inmate's innocence or result in mitigation of his sentence. As the inmate was not required under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.852(i) to wait until the death warrant was signed to make an additional public records request, and he gave no reason as to why the requests were not made until after the death warrant was signed, the trial court properly denied a request for the records. However, the postconviction court erred in granting a new penalty phase based on evidence that the trial court had, ex parte, directed the State to prepare the sentencing order, as the inmate was not prejudiced if the State had prepared the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the portion of the postconviction court's order denying the inmate's motion for postconviction relief and reversed the portion of its order granting a new penalty phase. It reinstated the death sentence and ordered the stay of execution dissolved effective 30 days after the instant decision became final.</SPAN></P>

His first conviction was reversed; he was convicted again after a retrial. On appeal, he argued that retrial counsel was ineffective during the guilt and penalty phases. The supreme court held that the defenses retrial counsel presented (self-defense and &quot;depraved mind&quot; second-degree murder) were valid and supported by the evidence, and the inmate's proposed alternative theory of defense was either unsupported by the evidence (voluntary intoxication) or inadmissible (diminished capacity). The inmate argued that retrial counsel was ineffective during the penalty phase for failing to present available mental health mitigation evidence. The supreme court disagreed. Such evidence had been presented in the first trial, which resulted in a death sentence. Retrial counsel specifically chose not to present mental health mitigation through experts because he believed their testimony at the first trial was more devastating than helpful, especially testimony that the inmate was very dangerous. He instead presented evidence from people who knew the inmate that he was a nonviolent, peaceful individual; this was a reasonable strategic decision.</SPAN></P>

The insurer's offer of judgment for $ 10,000 was rejected; the insured was awarded a judgment of $ 87,700. The trial court computed the award of attorney fees to the insured under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the jury verdict returned on behalf of the insured was 25 percent greater than the offer of judgment, thereby entitling her to attorney fees under Fla.

Stat. ch. 768.79. The supreme court agreed. Neither Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79 nor Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442 authorized the use of a multiplier in determining the amount of attorney fees as a sanction for the rejection of an offer. Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the district court decision exceeded the proper scope of second-tier certiorari review by addressing, sua sponte, the facial constitutionality of the ordinances at issue, the supreme court quashed that decision and remanded for further review. The circuit court had properly limited its remand to the zoning board with instructions to determine the application in accordance with its opinion. The district court modification exceeded its certiorari review power. An appellate court had no power in exercising its jurisdiction in certiorari to direct the corporation to take any particular action. It could only quash the order or decision under review and remand for further proceedings. Instead of limiting itself to addressing the two prongs of second-tier certiorari review, the district court reached an issue neither party raised in any phase of the proceedings. Sua sponte, the district court considered the facial constitutionality of the county ordinances. The district court exceeded the proper scope of second-tier certiorari review when it, sua sponte, held the ordinances in question facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court improperly weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors. The State's highest court held that there was sufficient evidence supporting the convictions. The findings of the cold, calculated, and premeditated manner and the pecuniary gain aggravating factors were supported by substantial evidence. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering the mitigating factors of defendant's employment history and his potential for rehabilitation, but assigning them little weight. Allowing the blood stain pattern expert's testimony was not an abuse of discretion. The issues raised as to the denial of the suppression motion were not preserved for review. The photographs of the surviving victim were relevant to show the victim's identity and the location of her wounds. The trial court's curative instruction was sufficient to correct any potential misconception that the jury had about the duty the defense had to rebut the serologist's testimony and the denial of the motion for mistrial was not an abuse of discretion. The prosecutorial misconduct in closing did not entitle defendant to relief. The death sentence was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his trial counsel was ineffective. The State's highest court held that there was not improper ex parte contact with the prosecutor. Trial counsel was not ineffective in not presenting certain mental health and other mitigating evidence, as it could have opened the door to other damaging testimony. The postconviction court properly denied the remaining 19 issues summarily, as the alleged errors were either meritless, procedurally barred, or did not meet the Strickland standard for ineffective assistance of counsel. For instance, conceding guilt to the lesser charges was a recognized strategy. Filing a motion to disqualify the trial judge would not have succeeded, nor would a motion for a change in venue. Defendant did not show that any realistic evidence existed to support his theory that the officers fired the first shot. Eight members of the jury venire were excused due to their opinions in favor of the death penalty, refuting defendant's argument that voir dire was ineffective. Because the alleged individual errors were without merit, the contention of cumulative error was similarly without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was found stabbed to death in his home, and the evidence established that there was no forced entry into his home. Defendant testified that both he and an accomplice accompanied the victim to his home, that the three men consumed alcohol, and that he awoke to see the victim and his accomplice fighting in the kitchen. The court reversed defendant's conviction after concluding that the jury might have relied on an erroneous definition of burglary as the basis for the felony murder conviction. The jury had been instructed on premeditated murder and felony murder, and the felony murder instruction was based on alternate theories, namely, robbery and burglary. However, where an individual entered a dwelling with consent, the burglary statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 810.02, only applied if the individual remained there surreptitiously. As defendant argued, the evidence showed that he was a consensual invitee into the victim's home but did not show that he had surreptitiously remained there. The general jury verdict thus could not stand because one of the prosecution's theories was legally inadequate, and the court could not discern on what grounds defendant had been convicted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was originally sentenced to death following a murder and robbery. During postconviction proceedings, petitioner agreed to waive any potential guilt-phase claims, and the State agreed to a new sentencing. A jury recommended a death sentence. After weighing three aggravating circumstances and 25 mitigating factors, including two statutory mitigating factors, the trial court again sentenced petitioner to death. The court affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by reducing the weight given to the two statutory mental mitigators from &quot;full weight&quot; to &quot;some weight&quot; in light of the contradictory evidence in the record. The death penalty was also not disproportional even with 25 mitigating factors. Proportionality was not a comparison between the number of aggravating and mitigating factors but was rather a qualitative comparison. Petitioner's death sentence was proportional to other cases where the death sentence had been applied, for example, where there were aggravators of a previous violent felony conviction and pecuniary gain, where both statutory mental mitigators were present, and where there were other nonstatutory mitigators.</SPAN></P>

He threatened a neighbor, who then called police and defendant was arrested. The jury found him guilty of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court initially noted that there was sufficient support for the conviction. The court held that application of the aggravating circumstance of heinous, atrocious, and cruel was erroneous, as the trial court misconstrued the evidence. Although defendant reloaded the gun, there was no indication that it was done &quot;slowly,&quot; nor was there proof as to which of the five shots caused the fatal injury. However, the court held that such error was harmless, in that two other aggravators were found. The court noted that there was support for the finding that the murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated, based on the pre-planning of the murder. The doctrine of transferred intent was applicable on this aggravator. The sentence was proportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County (Florida) convicted defendant of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death, finding both the heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC), as well as the cold, calculated, and premeditated (CCP) aggravating factors. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence. The appeals court rejected them all. First, the fact that defendant talked with detectives about the murder prior to receiving a Miranda warning did not by itself affect the admissibility of his subsequent confession. The circumstances surrounding a warned confession properly cured the condition that rendered the unwarned statement inadmissible. Second, each venireperson challenged indicated that they could fairly and impartially consider the evidence presented and apply the law as instructed. Third, there was no basis to determine whether the police detectives could testify as to statements made to them by a co-defendant, under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.804(2)(c). Fourth, the autopsy photographs admitted aided in explaining the examiner's testimony. Fifth, the trial court applied the correct law in considering the disproportionate sentences of the co-defendants. Sixth, given the way the victim was murdered, the evidence supported both the HAC and CCP aggravating factors. Seventh, there was no proportionality error. Finally, defendant's confession to the murder, as well as the events surrounding it, supported the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant killed two elderly people that he worked for and he stole their valuables. He was convicted and sentenced, and a direct appeal resulted in an affirmance. His motion for postconviction relief was denied by the trial court. On appeal from that order, the court found that his counsel was not ineffective in failing to investigate, failing to raise the defense of voluntary intoxication, or in failing to provide evidence in mitigation at the penalty phase. The court noted that many claims raised by appellant were found to lack merit because they did not satisfy the two prongs of the Strickland ineffective assistance of counsel test. As to the voluntary intoxication defense, the court found that such was a trial strategy by appellant's counsel and there was no credible evidence to support such a defense. Similarly, there was no finding of credible evidence to support any alleged mitigation factors that appellant raised. The court concluded that appellant's counsel acted reasonably and no prejudice was shown. The court summarily denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus without discussion, and found that the capital sentencing scheme was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

He was charged with six serial murders, all following the same pattern, which counts were severed. He was found guilty of first-degree murder in this, the first murder trial. On appeal, the court found that denial of cause challenges to six prospective jurors was proper because they were shown to be impartial, and the use of Williams rule evidence of the other five murders was proper to establish premeditation. Similarly, evidence that led the police to suspect defendant of the serial murders was relevant. There was sufficient evidence of premeditation to support the denial of defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal. Other evidentiary rulings did not require reversal, and there was no fundamental error in the prosecutor's opening and closing arguments. Defendant's confession was voluntary. There was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's sentencing determination, based on the aggravating and mitigating circumstances found, and the death sentence was proportional to the crime committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, owner of a seized vehicle, sought review of a decision of the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida), which reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the owner in respondent sheriff's forfeiture action of his vehicles, under the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 932.701 to -.707 (1999). There was a conflict certified with the Fifth District Court of Appeals as to the effect of the time limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff's office investigated two vehicles on petitioner's business property and determined that the vehicle identification numbers were altered. Accordingly, the sheriff seized the vehicles; almost four months later, he filed a complaint for forfeiture under the Act, based on further investigation that revealed that one vehicle was listed as stolen. However, petitioner filed a bill of sale and a Florida vehicle registration, claiming that he was a bona fide purchaser for value. The trial court granted summary judgment to petitioner, holding that the forfeiture required dismissal because it was filed more than 45 days after seizure. On appeal, the appellate court reversed, holding that the 45-day limit was not a bar and that petitioner lacked standing to assert a claim. On further appeal due to conflict between districts, the court held that the 45-day limit was mandatory, which was the holding espoused by the Fifth District Court of Appeal. The court noted that forfeiture statutes were construed strictly, and by using the word &quot;shall,&quot; it was determined that the requirement to &quot;promptly proceed&quot; within 45 days was required under Fla. Stat. chs. 932.704(4) and 932.701(2)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the Second District's decision, approved the holding of the Fifth District with respect to the mandatory nature of the time limits, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the denial of his post-conviction motion. The instant court upheld the denial on his first three claims, because they were raised in a prior Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion and were not based on newly discovered evidence. A fourth claim was insufficiently pled. Because the claims were either successive or insufficiently pled, it was unnecessary to reach the merits of the fifth claim. As to the habeas request, all seven claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were rejected. The fact that appellate counsel could have, but did not, challenge the admission of certain testimony was not deficient. Further, appellate counsel could not be deemed deficient for failing to raise a procedurally barred issue. Third, since the sufficiency of the State's evidence to prove the cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravator was addressed and disposed of on direct appeal, appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise a meritless claim. A claim that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that the trial court did not properly consider all of the mitigation was meritless. Finally, his conflict of interest claim was rejected as insufficiently pled.</SPAN></P>

The inmate was found in possession of her car, rope matching that used to bind her, and the murder weapon. His accomplice testified against him under a plea bargain. The supreme court held that application of the Cronic presumption of prejudice standard based on egregiously deficient performance by counsel during voir dire was not supported by the record, as counsel conducted a vigorous voir dire, and two jurors and both alternate jurors were black (as was the inmate). Though the sentencing order did not comply with Campbell, as the trial court failed to assign weights to aggravating and mitigating circumstances on an individualized basis, there was no fundamental error, since the order was otherwise thorough and detailed. The State's reference to the inmate's uncharged sexual encounter with the victim was supported by testimony and was used to rebut his claim that he had consensual sex with the victim, and as support for statutory aggravators--not to establish nonstatutory aggravation. The State's comments about the victim's last words were based on testimony and were neither hypothetical nor improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised 18 claims. Sixteen of the claims were summarily affirmed because they were procedurally barred or lacked merit. Only the first and fifth claims, asserting a Brady violation and ineffective assistance of counsel, were addressed. The state supreme court concluded that the State's failure to disclose the hair analysis did not prejudice defendant. It was undisputed that defendant was present at the scene shortly before the victim's death. The jury concluded that defendant killed the victim, stole her $ 4,100, fled with her car to a lodge, abandoned the car there, and continued his getaway in a taxi. The fact that two hairs found in or on the victim's hand did not belong to defendant did not place the case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict. Also, although trial counsel did question the medical examiner about the possibility of suicide, such questioning was only a small part of an overall defense that defendant did not commit the murder. Finally, defendant's habeas corpus claims were denied because one claim had already been raised on direct appeal, and the other had been rejected by the state supreme court in a previous case.</SPAN></P>

Dep't of Health v. N. Fla. Women's Health &amp; Counseling Servs., Inc., 852 So. 2d 254, 2001 Fla. App. LEXIS 1217 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1st Dist., 2001)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the Parental Notice Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 390.01115 (1999) was enacted, petitioners, several women's clinics, women's rights groups, and physicians sought injunctive and declaratory relief to block the enforcement of the Act, claiming that it violated a minor's constitutional rights. The trial court agreed, but the First District Court of Appeal, Florida, reversed. The women's groups appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the women's groups contended that the trial court properly applied a prior case as controlling precedent in finding the Act unconstitutional. Emphasizing the doctrine of stare decisis, the supreme court declined the State's invitation to recede from the prior case's decision. The supreme court held that the Act's requirement that a minor must notify a parent of her decision to have an abortion violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, as it was a significant intrusion on a minor's right of privacy. Further, the district court's ultimate determination, that the Act furthered a compelling State interest because it allowed parents to assist in giving post-abortion care to a minor, was controverted by the findings of the trial court. The trial court found that, while such parental support was preferable, most minors, especially older minors, were capable of following directions for aftercare treatment. By ignoring the trial court's findings, the district court violated the basic precept of appellate review. Any comparison between the federal and Florida rights of privacy was inapposite, in light of the fact that there was no express federal right of privacy clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's holding was quashed, and the trial court's decision permanently enjoining enforcement of the Act was approved.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that (1) an officer's reference to DNA evidence, where DNA tests had not yet been performed, and (2) his reference to finding the victim's body so that it could be buried (the &quot;Christian burial&quot; technique) were insufficient to make defendant's otherwise voluntary statement inadmissible. As defendant drove around with the victim in the trunk for several hours and took her to two remote locations before killing her through the use of multiple means, the trial court properly found the &quot;cold, calculated, and premeditated&quot; aggravator. It properly found the &quot;avoid arrest&quot; aggravator, as defendant admitted he killed the victim because he was afraid she could identify him. It was entitled to disregard defendant's expert's opinion that defendant was under extreme mental or emotional disturbance if it felt that the opinion was unsupported by facts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence. The appeals court first held that eyewitness testimony connected him to the victim and incriminating physical evidence linked him to her home where her body was found. Thus, the evidence supported the conviction. Second, defendant was not entitled to a mistrial due to the prosecutor's penalty phase closing argument in which he stated that defendant's actions were to eliminate the victim as a witness. Third, the prosecutor's argument of an improper aggravating circumstance did not taint the penalty phase nor did it cause the death sentence to be unconstitutionally imposed. Fourth, after trial court gave serious consideration to defendant's special instruction, it was not superior to the catch-all instruction. Fifth, prior convictions were exempt from facts that had to be submitted to a jury because they increased the penalty for a crime. Because a unanimous jury convicted defendant of both murder and sexual battery, the guilt phase verdicts reflected that the jury independently found the aggravator of the murder being committed in the course of a sexual battery. Finally, the death sentence was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered pleas to two counts of attempted lewd and lascivious conduct, a third-degree felony, in exchange for concurrent sentences of 66.4 months under Florida's Prison Releasee Reoffender Punishment Act (PRRPA), Fla.

During the plea colloquy, the judge advised him that the PRRPA designation would require him to serve the entire sentence day-for-day. Nevertheless, he filed a motion to correct his sentence, arguing his sentence was illegal under State v. Wilson, 793 So. 2d 1003 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001) and Irons v. State, 791 So. 2d 1221 (Fla. 5th DCA 2001). The trial court denied the motion and the Court of Appeal of Florida, First District, affirmed. The supreme court held PRRPA established a mandatory minimum sentence and did not prevent the trial court from imposing a greater sentence of incarceration as authorized by law; and the trial court did not violate defendant's rights by sentencing him to 60 months under the PRRPA and an additional 6.4 months under CPC. To the extent Wilson and Irons were inconsistent with the decision, they were disapproved.</SPAN></P>

On remand of the sentence, three aggravating factors were found: the murder was committed in the course of a robbery or for pecuniary gain, defendant was previously convicted of a crime of violence, and it was cold, calculated, and premeditated. On appeal, the court found that the trial court's rejection of defendant's alibi defense was proper. The court reviewed the jury instructions regarding potential mitigating factors and aggravating factors and determined that there was no abuse of discretion and that the findings were supported by the evidence.

His attorneys did not have any conflicts of interest that rendered their assistance ineffective. Additionally, the court found that trial counsel and appellate counsel had not rendered ineffective assistance of counsel as to any of the issues raised by the inmate. Their decisions regarding whether to present mitigating evidence and regarding his mental state at the time of the crimes were strategically reasonable, and there was no reason to have sought a continuance. Although it was error to have allowed the State to present evidence of his lack of remorse, there was no prejudice that resulted therefrom.

Appellant was indicted by a grand jury and convicted of first-degree murder. During the penalty phase when the jury had already retired, he tried to commit suicide. He was accordingly absent from the trial court's discussion of the jury's request on instructions, and was still absent when they returned with their death sentence recommendation. Appeals resulted in an affirmance, and appellant sought a writ of habeas corpus and postconviction relief. The court held that his counsel's background investigation was sufficient, and accordingly there was no ineffective assistance. There was no due process violation by the State's conducting mental health evaluations shortly before his postconviction evidentiary hearing, nor was there an Ake rule violation. The judge's conversations with the State's counsel were impartial and concerned administrative matters. Summary denial of an evidentiary hearing on certain claims was proper where they were already appealed or could have been, and an objection to a potential juror's dismissal did not properly preserve the issue for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with capital sexual battery upon a person less than 12 years of age and with lewd and lascivious assault of the victim, in violation of Fla.

The trial court denied defendant's request for a lesser included offense instruction of lewd and lascivious conduct with respect to the sexual battery charge. Defendant was convicted on both counts and sentenced. On appeal, the First District held that the trial court properly denied the requested instruction. The matter was certified for review due to holdings in other precedents which indicated that such an instruction was permitted. The court adopted the First District's reasoning, holding that the crimes of sexual battery and lewd and lascivious conduct were mutually exclusive, and accordingly, a lesser included instruction was inappropriate. The court reviewed the statutory language and the Schedule of Lesser Included Offenses in arriving at its conclusion. Accordingly, it noted its disapproval, to the extent of a conflict, with the holdings of King v. State, 642 So.2d 649 (Fla. 2d DCA 1994), and Velazquez v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision by the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) denying defense counsel's motion to withdraw his Anders brief and finding that defendant failed to preserve his sentencing issue as to his probation violation sentence, as no Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b) (as amended) (2000) motion was filed. The intermediate court certified the issue as a question of great public importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that to require him to raise a single subject challenge to 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 184 by filing a motion to correct sentencing error under Rule 3.800(b) would have been a useless act because at the time that he filed his first appellate brief, Trapp v. State, 736 So. 2d 736 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1999) was binding precedent and resolved the issue against him. The State's highest court held that defendant should not be penalized for the failure to file a Rule 3.800(b)(2) motion based on speculation that the Heggs opinion would disapprove the Trapp decision. There was no sentencing error at the time the Anders brief was filed. The Heggs decision was issued a week later, and created a sentencing error that did not exist before the first brief was filed. Defense counsel filed a motion to withdraw his Anders brief and an initial brief on the merits raising the Heggs issue two weeks later, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 3.800(b) was applicable to defendant. Due to the interests of justice, judicial efficiency, and the unique circumstances of the case, defendant was permitted to raise his Heggs error as a fundamental sentencing error for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was vacated. The case was remanded for resentencing in accordance with the laws in effect on the date on which defendant committed his original offense. The intermediate court's decision was quashed, and the certified question was answered in the affirmative for the limited purpose it expressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two questions for review were: (1) whether the concept of fundamental sentencing error applied to defendants who could have availed themselves of the most recent amendments to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b); and, (2) Did the Florida Supreme Court decision in Maddox v. State preclude the district court from ruling on the issue as a matter of fundamental error? The supreme court answered no to the first question, with the exception of fundamental error arising from the facial unconstitutionality of a sentencing statute, and yes to the second, approving the decision below. Defendant did not raise his unpreserved sentencing errors in the trial court before presenting them in his direct appeal. He filed the initial appeal brief more than a year after the window for raising unpreserved sentencing errors on appeal closed. Thus, he was precluded from raising his claims for the first time on appeal. Finally, the supreme court reaffirmed that the window period recognized for raising unpreserved fundamental sentencing errors closed with the effective date of amendments to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.111(e), 3.800 and Fla. R. App. P. 9.020(h), 9.140, 9.600, and not with the issuance of Maddox.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate, who had been convicted of and sentenced to death for murder, filed a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The Circuit Court, Martin County, Florida, denied his motion, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of killing another inmate. He claimed the trial court erred in denying an evidentiary hearing on his claim of juror misconduct. He presented an affidavit of a lawyer who alleged that a woman claiming she was a juror at the inmate's trial told the lawyer that jurors (1) told racial jokes about the inmate, (2) said they would vote for guilt and a life sentence because they wanted the inmate to go back to prison to kill more black inmates, and (3) discussed outside articles about the trial in violation of a court order. The supreme court held that the trial court erred in finding that this alleged juror misconduct inhered in the verdict, and thus could not be considered. Appeals to racial bias made openly among jurors, and any receipt by jurors of prejudicial non-record information, constituted sufficient overt acts of misconduct to permit court inquiry. As the inmate had advised his trial counsel that he had not been abused as a child, counsel was not ineffective for failing to investigate the abuse issue. He failed to prove a Brady or a Giglio violation; and even if he had, he failed to show that such violation could have affected the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of postconviction relief was affirmed, with the exception of the claim of juror misconduct. The case was remanded for an evidentiary hearing on that claim, with the scope of the hearing limited to attempting to obtain the identity of the juror who spoke to the attorney about alleged misconduct, to interview her, and then to conduct further interviews only if the court determined there was a reasonable probability of juror misconduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery and murder. The record revealed that the victim was seen with defendant in her car, and she indicated to witnesses that she was giving him a ride. Defendant was having financial problems but was seen with a lot of money shortly after having been with the victim, who was making a deposit for her employer. The court found sufficient evidence to support the convictions. There was no error in denying suppression, where defendant had initially consented to allow the police to enter his trailer, his furtive movements gave them cause for an investigatory search under Terry, and his statements to police were made after he received Miranda warnings, although he was not under arrest. Hearsay statements of the victim were improperly admitted, as was a credit application with false statements, but they were deemed harmless. Trial court errors of admitting a detective's prior consistent statement and statements from defendant's wife were deemed harmless due to their negligible effects. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's determination of aggravating and mitigating factors and found the death sentence was proportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the denial of his renewed motion for postconviction relief by the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit (Florida) and petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus after his conviction of murder and death sentence were affirmed, his petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied, his motion for clemency was denied, and his motion for postconviction relief was denied for the second time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This opinion was substituted for a previous opinion. Defendant argued that the cold, calculated, and premeditated (CCP) jury instruction given at the resentencing hearing was unconstitutional. The State's highest court held that the CCP instruction violated the Eighth Amendment, but that defendant was not entitled to retroactive relief, as he failed to object at trial. Allowing the State's expert to testify although he had an obvious conflict was harmless. The trial court did not improperly adopt the sentencing order proposed by the State. The inclusion of one errant phrase in the sentencing order was not significant evidence that the trial court relied upon improper evidence in sentencing defendant. There was overwhelming evidence of defendant's leadership role in the crimes. Defendant's participation in the felony robbery was major, and his death sentence was not cruel, unusual, or disproportionate. The signing of a death warrant by the Governor did not unconstitutionally shorten the time period in which defendant could file his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion. Defendant failed to successfully assert a Brady violation. Defendant received effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

Further, appellate counsel was not ineffective (1) for failing to argue that the cold, calculated, and premeditated instruction was unconstitutionally vague; (2) for failing to argue that the trial court committed fundamental error by instructing the jury on the avoid arrest aggravator; and (3) for failing to challenge the trial court's admission of a pair of pants into evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because a police officer could not read a temporary tag on defendant's vehicle as it drove by, the officer initiated a traffic stop pursuant to Fla.

Although the officer read the tag as he approached the car and found nothing improper, he obtained information from defendant, which ultimately led to a charge of felony driving with a suspended license. The state supreme court held that pursuant to U.S. Const. amends. IV, XIV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, the original purpose of the investigatory stop was satisfied before the officer made personal contact with defendant. Having verified the total validity of defendant's temporary tag, the officer could lawfully make personal contact only to explain the reason for the initial stop.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed an elderly couple. Defendant told a nurse they owed him money. Defendant claimed his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present a voluntary intoxication defense, and that he was prejudiced because such intoxication negated specific intent, the requisite mental state for first-degree murder. Counsel stated he did not pursue a voluntary intoxication defense for several reasons. First, it was his experience that juries did not accept voluntary intoxication as a defense or mitigating factor, especially when the charge was murder. In addition, defendant told counsel that he was not intoxicated at the time of the murders and that he was innocent. The trial court found none of defendant's witnesses to be credible. The appellate court held defendant did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel in regard to presenting an intoxication defense. The trial court's conclusion that counsel's investigation as to mitigation was reasonable and that defendant failed to establish prejudice was also proper, as counsel could not be deemed ineffective for not presenting conflicting opinions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee patients sued appellants, the health care plan and the physicians, in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit (Florida), for medical malpractice. The case was set for trial on the senior judges' docket. The health care plan and the physicians filed a motion in circuit court to return the case to the elected circuit judge. The circuit court denied the motion. The health care plan and the physician filed writs of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The health care plan and the physicians challenged the senior judges' docket in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit and sought to prohibit the assignment of senior judges to preside over long trial medical malpractice and other complex litigation cases. The supreme court found that the Florida Constitution permitted the appointment of nonelected judges, as this was not a violation of suffrage rights. Further, the senior judge assignments in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit were compatible with the supreme court's instructions and guidance. The senior judge assignments were used to maximize the efficient administration of justice and had the practical effect of supplementing and assisting the circuit court judges rather than usurping the judges' jurisdiction over a particular type of case. Additionally, the senior judge assignments were temporary and thus did not violate the constitutional parameters of Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(b). Finally, the use of senior judges to relieve overcrowding of the civil and criminal dockets in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit did not constitute a complex case division that required approval by local rule. Thus, the senior judge assignments were proper.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found a number of defendant's postconviction claims to be either procedurally barred, facially or legally insufficient, or clearly without merit as a matter of law.

The appellate court held defendant established that improper ex parte communication occurred between the trial court and the State, since the prosecutor was present in the clerk's office, assisting her with the wording of the sentencing order. However, defendant's right to a neutral judge was not prejudiced by the improper ex parte communication. The postconviction court properly considered the nature of the contact between the judge's law clerk and the prosecutor and determined there was no evidence the judge failed to independently weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in defendant's case. There was no evidence that the trial judge made any decision prior to the end of the penalty phase and prior to weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances to impose a sentence of death.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 3(b)(3), the court accepted applications for review of directly conflicting judgments of the District Court of Appeal, Fifth District, Orange County, and the District Court of Appeal, Fourth District, Broward County (Florida). The first trial court found a presumption of vindictiveness in a first defendant's sentence, while the second trial court found no such presumption as to a second defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In both cases, trial judges participated in unsuccessful plea negotiations. After trials or hearings, both trial judges sentenced the defendants to harsher punishments than those they had rejected. The first intermediate appellate court held that the trial judge's participation raised a presumption of vindictiveness, but the second intermediate appellate court refused to so find. The court held that the presumption did not arise automatically and that the appropriate analysis was a totality of the circumstances review. As to the first defendant, the court found an unrebutted presumption of vindictiveness because the trial court improperly urged the first defendant to accept the plea offer and the disparity between the offered sentence and the one imposed was large. The presumption arose as to the second defendant because the trial judge departed from the role of a neutral arbiter by stating that the offer should have been accepted and the record lacked facts to explain the increased sentence. The court held that the appropriate remedy when an unrebutted presumption of vindictiveness arose was resentencing before a different trial judge. Both cases were remanded for that purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to the first defendant, the court approved the holding that an unrebutted presumption of vindictiveness had arisen but quashed the remedy and the determination that the presumption arose automatically. As to the second defendant, the court quashed the decision to the extent that no presumption of vindictiveness was found. Both cases were remanded for resentencing before a different trial judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first attorney claimed that he was entitled to be compensated at a higher hourly rate under the circumstances of the case.

Second, the award to the first attorney was affirmed, pursuant to Fla. Stat. chs. 27.710(6), 27.711(4) (1999). The State did not contest the number of hours expended by both the first and second attorney and agreed with fees as reduced to the hourly rate of $ 100 as long as the court made clear the statutory authority for these amounts. Next, the award of attorney's fees to a third attorney was reversed based on the lack of statutory authority for the award, and the award of expert witness fees to both experts was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fatally stabbed and asphyxiated his former girlfriend. He had told a coworker he was going to kill the victim. Blood on sneakers that were identified as defendant's had a DNA profile consistent with the victim's. The jury convicted defendant and recommended death. The trial judge found one aggravator -- that the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel -- and four mitigators. The supreme court held that cross-examination of defendant and other defense witnesses as to defendant's prior assaults on the victim was proper, as this evidence explained and modified direct testimony, was relevant, and its probative value was not outweighed by the prejudicial effect. The State's DNA expert was qualified to testify as to population frequencies of the DNA profile she discovered; while she did not help create the database, she was familiar with samples from which it was created. Nondisclosure of a State witness's probation violation report did not violate Brady, as there was no showing the report was material. The trial court adequately considered the impaired capacity mitigator, the death sentence was proportional, and Florida's capital sentencing scheme was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court rejected petitioner's contention that ch. 903.0471 violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, dealing with pretrial release and detention. Fla. Stat. ch. 903.0471 did not violate, but worked hand-in-hand with, Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 to assure the integrity of the judicial process. Fla. Stat. ch. 903.0471 did not violate substantive due process by authorizing a court to deny a second pretrial release upon finding probable cause that a petitioner committed a new crime, as probable cause, which was a sufficient basis on which to make an arrest, was not too low a standard to be constitutional. And ch. 903.0471 did not violate procedural due process by not requiring an adversarial hearing prior to revocation of pretrial release, as the U.S. Constitution allowed a probable cause determination to be made by a judicial officer without an adversarial hearing.</SPAN></P>

Blood with genetic markers consistent with hers was found at the home of defendant, her neighbor. After defendant was found guilty, he insisted that no mitigating evidence be presented to the jury. The trial court honored this request, but appointed special counsel to present mitigating evidence outside the presence of the jury. The supreme court held that the trial court did not err in giving great weight to the jury's recommendation of a death sentence and had not been required to have mitigation evidence presented to the jury, due to defendant's knowledgeable waiver. The trial court independently weighed aggravating and mitigating circumstances before imposing the death sentence the jury recommended, which was proper. It did not err by excluding the victim's hearsay statements that her life had been threatened by an unnamed party or parities, as no exception to the hearsay rule applied and there was no evidence tending to connect such person to the crime. The death penalty was proportional in light of the aggravating factors. Florida's capital sentencing scheme was not unconstitutional under Ring v. Arizona.</SPAN></P>

Co-defendant took pictures of the body, including a picture of defendant's hand holding the victim's foot. Defendant kept the calf muscle refrigerated at home. The trial court found that the greater weight of the evidence did not establish that defendant acted under extreme duress or under the substantial domination of another person. No competency hearing was requested. The appellate court held the trial court did not abuse its discretion by not conducting a competency hearing during the penalty phase. Other than defendant's self-serving confession, the record contained no direct evidence that co-defendant had dominated defendant or that defendant's participation was minor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to two counts of first-degree murder for the shooting deaths of his wife and his stepdaughter. He filed a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion for postconviction relief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The Circuit Court, Gadsden County (Florida), denied the motion. Defendant appealed and also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove to the wife's trailer, entered without turning on the lights, shot the wife execution-style while she lay sleeping, and then proceeded to the stepdaughter's bedroom. In support of his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion, defendant alleged that trial counsel failed to retain a mental-health expert to evaluate possible statutory and nonstatutory mitigating evidence concerning beatings he received from his father from the age of three to the age of around 11 and his abuse of alcohol. The state's highest court held that defendant failed to demonstrate that counsel's strategy for the presentation of the penalty phase evidence was deficient. He failed to demonstrate deficient conduct in failing to present the child abuse evidence. And, although defendant had ingested a considerable quantity of alcohol before the murders, his actions both before and during the murders and the length of time over which the alcohol was consumed supported the trial court's finding that there was insufficient evidence to establish that defendant was under the influence of alcohol when he killed the victims. Further, the habeas petition was denied as the death penalty statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's denial of postconviction relief was affirmed. Defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV) appealed from the affirmance of the trial court's entry of summary judgment for appellee driver by the Florida District Court of Appeal, which held that 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 223 violated the single subject rule in Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver claimed that 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 223, &sect; 2 lacked a logical or natural connection to the subject matter of ch. 223. The supreme court agreed that the law violated the single subject rule of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 223, &sect; 2, which involved assigning bad check debt to a private debt collector, had no natural or logical connection to the law's subject matter: driver's licenses, operation of motor vehicles, and vehicle registrations. The subject matter of ch. 233 was defined in part by the substantial revisions to a state house bill. When the house bill was returned by the state senate, the bill's subject was changed to driver's licenses, vehicle registrations and operation of motor vehicles. The bill was passed at the end of the legislative session. In enacting ch. 223, the legislature unconstitutionally combined two subjects into one law. The DHSMV's argument that &sect; 2 correlated to 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 223, &sect;&sect; 1, 3 did not consider &sect; 2's complete lack of correlation to 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 223, &sect;&sect; 6-14. There was no connection between assigning bad check debt to a private collector and driver's licenses, vehicle registrations, and motor vehicle operation.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida), after an evidentiary hearing, vacated the death sentence and granted a new penalty phase proceeding before a jury pursuant to appellant's Fed. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion. The State appealed. Appellant cross-appealed and petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant poured solvents on the victim and set him on fire. The victim's dying declaration, admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule, named appellant as his murderer. Appellant said the victim set himself on fire, but testimony from appellant's cellmate and persons from whom appellant obtained solvents supported the victim's declaration. The supreme court, in affirming the appeals court's determination that appellant's counsel was ineffective at the sentencing, but not the guilt, phase, noted that the appeals court had competent and substantial evidence from which it could conclude appellant was prejudiced by his attorney's plain deficiencies in failing to (1) obtain competent medical evaluations and court and prison background information for those evaluations--related to mitigators of mental deficiencies and poor impulse control (brain dysfunction and psychiatric illness) as opposed to ability to stand trial; (2) thoroughly investigate appellant's background, (3) seek additional time and resources. The appellate courts could not conclude that additional evidence would not have affected the seven to five jury vote for the death penalty. Arson was an aggravator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and his accomplices committed murder during a robbery for cash and drugs. Appellant contended that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel as to certain issues. On appeal, the court found that because no objection was interposed during the resentencing proceedings, appellant was foreclosed from claiming relief for more comprehensive jury instructions. Further, while it was error for the trial court to allow a mental health professional with an obvious conflict of interest to testify during the postconviction proceedings, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the trial court did not actually rely upon the expert's testimony in reaching its decision. Additionally, there was no evidence to support appellant's contention that the State created or originated the sentencing order. Moreover, the trial court had substantial evidence to support the conclusions contained in its sentencing order. Finally, the death sentence was warranted by appellant's relative culpability and leadership of the operation which caused the deaths of the three victims. Accordingly, counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise these meritless claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Florida Keys Aqueduct Authority (FKAA) filed a complaint under Fla. Stat. ch. 75 in the Circuit Court in and for Monroe County, Florida, seeking validation of its sewer revenue bonds and a judgment that its service area was wholly within the Florida Keys area of critical state concern and that 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 395, &sect; 4 was a general law applicable in that area. The circuit court granted this relief; appellant citizen sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the authority of 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 395, &sect; 4, the FKAA and a city enacted connection ordinances which included package plants within their scope and required mandatory connections within 30 days of receipt of notification that a publicly-owned or investor-owned sewage system was available. The citizen argued in the circuit court that as &sect; 4 pertained only to local governments within the Florida Keys area of critical state concern, it was a special law unconstitutionally passed as a general law in violation of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10, and that the connection ordinances were unenforceable because their provisions regarding package plants were based solely on the authority granted by 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 395, &sect; 4. The circuit court held that &sect; 4 was properly enacted as a general law and that the connection ordinances were valid and binding. The supreme court agreed. Though &sect; 4 affected a limited geographic area of the state, its primary purpose was one of statewide importance and impact, and that purpose was rationally related to the designation of the Florida Keys as an area of critical state concern; therefore, it was a valid general law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida Supreme Court had Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; (b)(1) jurisdiction. Defendant's jury was separate from the two co-defendants' jury. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not severing Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) charges (and found sufficient evidence to support RICO's enumerated elements). RICO charges helped to provide the required significant, meaningful relationship, or link, temporal and otherwise, between the events, which extended over six months, so that all defendants and counts could be tried together. Defendants were in a continuing business activity of abduction and extortion. The imposition of the death penalty was supported by the finding that five aggravators of (1) prior violent felony, (2) during the commission of a kidnapping, (3) avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest, (4) pecuniary gain, and (5) cold, calculated, and premeditated, to the two killed, mutilated, burned, and dumped victims, and one aggravator of heinous, atrocious, or cruel to one of those victims, outweighed no statutory and five nonstatutory mitigators, to which little weight was given. Other than a Golden Rule argument the prosecutor's remarks were fair.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court determined (1) that competent, substantial evidence supported all of defendant's convictions, and (2) that defendant's sentences of death were proportional, and affirmed the convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

Appellant also petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed the State wrote the sentencing order. The appellate court, inter alia, found no evidence of improper contact between the trial court and the State. Defense counsel was not ineffective in failing to confer with the mental health expert as to appellant's competency to waive his Miranda and extradition hearing rights. Appellant's Ake rights were not violated. Defense counsel was not ineffective in the background information provided to the mental health expert, in failing to object to the trial judge's refusal to instruct the jury on the emotional disturbance mitigating factor, in failing to present an insanity defense, in failing to call a DNA expert, or in conceding guilt and arguing for a second-degree murder conviction. The State's case was subjected to an adversarial testing. There was no conflict of interest, as defense counsel resigned his appointment as an honorary deputy sheriff. There were no Brady violations. Other ineffective assistance of counsel claims were procedurally barred. The habeas petition was denied, as appellate counsel was not ineffective, an Eighth Amendment claim was premature, and Florida's death penalty statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Circuit Court in and for Escambia County (Florida) which sentenced him to death for a murder committed during a burglary after the jury voted eight to four in recommending the death sentence. Defendant raised several issues including whether the death penalty was constitutional and whether his sentence was proportional given that the codefendants were given life sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two others forcibly entered and burglarized the home of the victim and his wife. The wife was repeatedly raped and the victim was shot in the back of the head by defendant. At resentencing, several witnesses testified on behalf of the State, including the victim's friends, family, neighbors, and members of law enforcement. The defense did not put on any witnesses, relying instead on cross-examination to attack the credibility of each witness. The appellate court held defendant was more culpable than his codefendants, as he confessed to shooting the victim. Thus, his sentence of death was not disproportional. The appellate court had previously determined that while there was insufficient evidence to establish premeditation, there was sufficient evidence to support felony murder. The trial judge considered mitigating circumstances. Given the circumstances inherent in resentencing, the trial court's decision to allow some factual development in the case was not error. The victim impact testimony was proper. Neither Apprendi nor Ring required a finding that the Florida capital sentencing scheme was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, petitioner sheriff sought a writ of prohibition in the Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) to prohibit deputy sheriffs from exercising collective bargaining rights under the representation of respondent labor organization.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The labor organization sought, and received, authority from the Public Employees Relations Commission, to enforce the collective bargaining rights of deputy sheriffs in the sheriff's department. The supreme court held Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 provided the right of employees to collective bargaining. The right was fundamental, and the strict scrutiny test was applied to any action tending to undermine it. Both public and private employees had the same broad collective bargaining rights. The plain meaning of the term &quot;employees&quot; in this provision was intended to be applied in its broadest sense to include all employees, public and private, as recipients of the right to bargain. When the Florida Constitution was adopted, the legislature considered whether public employees, as an entire class, had the right to collectively bargain, and the right was extended to all public employees. It was not claimed that the state had a compelling interest in depriving deputy sheriffs of the right to collectively bargain. To the extent any statutory provision prohibited deputy sheriffs from engaging in collective bargaining, it was contrary to the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions involved numerous persons. One victim was kidnapped in order to extort money. The victim was tortured and his family was threatened. Defendant and his accomplices eventually attempted to kill the victim by setting him and a vehicle ablaze. However, the victim escaped the burning vehicle, so defendant and his accomplices ran the victim over. However, the victim survived and testified against defendant. The other circumstances involved defendant and his accomplices murdering a wealthy businessman and his girlfriend. The State presented more than 90 witnesses. Defendant presented no evidence. The appellate court held the police affidavit had sufficiently detailed information to justify the issuance of a search warrant. The challenged witness testimony was either relevant or harmless. The prosecutor's remarks did not affect the jury's verdict. The aggravating circumstances were not offset by the mitigating circumstances. Defendant's death sentences did not lack proportionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contended that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The appellate court disagreed. The failure to present evidence of a potential brain damage in mitigation and the failure to present evidence of petitioner's cocaine addiction were strategic decisions. Petitioner failed to show prejudice by the failure to request an individual voir dire. The failure to present a particular character witness would have been more damaging than helpful. The trial court properly inspected the State's records for Brady materials. The admission of out-of-court statements of the accomplice, who was thereafter murdered, through other witnesses was proper. Further, the statements were admissible under the excited utterances exception. The heinous, atrocious, or cruel nature of the crime had been decided on appeal and could not be relitigated in a habeas petition. The heinous, atrocious, or cruel jury instruction was not unconstitutionally vague, and appellate counsel was not ineffective for failure to object to it. Any issue of the failure to object when the jury was informed that its role was merely advisory was not preserved for appeal, and did not constitute fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The not-for-profit groups contended the constitutional powers of the FWCC encompassed all marine life without exception, and thus the legislature could not lawfully restrict the FWCC's management or regulatory actions regarding any subclass of marine life.

Stat. ch. 120, when adopting rules or regulations in respect to those species of marine life that were defined as endangered, threatened, or species of special concern. The supreme court agreed with the lower appellate court that the trial court had applied Davis too broadly. When Fla. Const. art. IV, &sect; 9 and art. XII, &sect; 23(b) were read together, the provisions gave to the FWCC regulatory and executive powers with respect to marine life, including the regulatory and executive powers of the Marine Commission in effect on March 1, 1998.

The prosecutor told the trial judge that the witness had become uncooperative and it was unlikely that the witness would return to Florida for the retrial. The State did not attempt to have the witness declared unavailable for purposes of the retrial, and the record did not contain any supporting documentation that the State attempted to secure the witness's attendance for the retrial. There was no express finding by the trial court that the witness was unavailable. Defendant objected on the ground that his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated. The supreme court found that defendant's right to confrontation was violated and that he was entitled to a new trial. Furthermore, the supreme court held that ch. 90.803(22) violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment in criminal proceedings to the extent that it allowed the prosecutor to use at trial a witness's testimony from a previous judicial proceeding without a showing by the prosecutor that the witness was unavailable.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that (1) the trial court applied the correct rule of law and his findings were supported by competent, substantial evidence; (2) the evidence, along with the natural and proper common-sense inferences, established that the daughter suffered fear, emotional strain, and terror during the events leading up to her murder, and thus the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance was appropriately found; (3) the trial court properly applied the aggravating factor of cold, calculated, and premeditated to the murder of the woman and the daughter; (4) the evidence was sufficient to support that the guilty plea underlying the convictions was given knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily; and (5) the death sentences for the murders were proportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed with the Florida Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contended that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise improper prosecutorial antics and arguments which constituted fundamental error. In addition to events occurring prior to his pleading guilty, petitioner alleged an off-the-record discussion, a prosecutorial comment concerning an attorney lying on the floor, and a commotion occurring during the penalty phase closing. Petitioner's trial counsel, however, did not object to any of those items. Thus, the items were not preserved and appellate counsel could not be ineffective for not raising those contentions on appeal unless those contentions constituted fundamental error. There was no basis to reasonably conclude the jury's unanimously recommended death sentence was tainted. None of petitioner's contentions, singularly or collectively, constituted fundamental error. Nor was he prejudiced during the sentencing order, as the trial court only considered in aggravation the statutory aggravating circumstances. Because it did not consider nonstatutory aggravating circumstances, petitioner's appellate counsel was not ineffective for not arguing that claim on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder and other crimes involving two attacks on his wife and stepson. The trial court imposed a death sentence, which was affirmed on direct appeal. The Circuit Court in and for Orange County, Florida, denied his motion for postconviction relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The postconviction petition alleged prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The supreme court held that all petitioner's postconviction claims were either procedurally barred, as they were not raised on direct appeal, or were without merit. The lower court's finding, that petitioner received competent, effective assistance of trial counsel, and, to the extent that counsel's performance was less than perfect, petitioner was not prejudiced, was supported by the record. Counsel's decision not to call experts as guilt phase witnesses on the issue of petitioner's alleged dissociative state during the murder (which was supported only by his self-report) was a matter of trial strategy; these experts did testify on this issue during the penalty phase. There were no Giglio violations, as the prosecutor did not intentionally misrepresent the evidence. As to the habeas petition, (1) Apprendi had previously been held not to apply to the Florida death penalty statute; and (2) the claim, that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct (which had not been objected to) on direct appeal, was meritless.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held counsel's failure to obtain a transcript of pre-trial testimony used to impeach petitioner was not prejudicial as petitioner insisted on testifying. Deciding not to use information from a co-defendant's sentencing was trial strategy. Failing to object to the admission of a pistol was not ineffective, as there was no credible argument to suppress it. When a search of the home where petitioner lived was consented to, and he did not forbid a search of an area where he hid evidence, seizing the evidence was proper, and counsel's failure to argue the consent did not cover this seizure was not ineffective. When the co-defendant, sentenced to death, was re-sentenced to life, this newly-discovered evidence did not require resentencing, as the defendants' roles justified different sentences. The habeas claims recharacterizing postconviction relief claims as ineffective appellate assistance were procedurally barred. Appellate counsel's failure to raise the admission of relevant evidence of petitioner's abuse of his co-defendant was not ineffective assistance, and any error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The highest appellate court found that there was a conflict between the lower courts of appeal regarding the issue of whether the cruelty to animals statute required the specific intent to cause a cruel death or excessive suffering. In rejecting defendant's challenge, the highest court found that the question of whether the crime of cruelty to animals required proof of a specific as opposed to a general criminal intent was a matter for the legislature to determine in defining the crime. In the instant case, the legislature required an intentional act that resulted in an animal's cruel death or excessive or repeated infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering. It did not require an intent to cause a cruel death or excessive suffering. The lack of a specific intent to inflict pain or otherwise cause a cruel death did not render the statute unconstitutional. The legislature had, by clear language, declared that one was guilty of the crime regardless of whether they acted with the specific intent to be cruel. It was a general intent crime, as the legislature intended. It was within the authority of the legislature to dispense with specific criminal intent when defining the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The First District Court of Appeal (Florida) certified its decision for review on the question of whether the trial court's use of a standard jury instruction for aggravated child abuse was fundamental or harmless error. Defendant was convicted of aggravated child abuse and raised an issue for the first time on appeal concerning the definition of malice in the Florida Standard Jury Instructions (Criminal).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question certified was whether giving the standard jury instruction for aggravated child abuse when the instruction inaccurately defined the disputed element of malice was fundamental error. The standard jury instruction contained an erroneous definition of malice. The appellate court held that the trial court erred when it gave the jury the definition of &quot;maliciously&quot; included in the standard jury instruction. The instruction permitted the jury to find defendant guilty based upon a finding of only legal, or technical, malice, rather than actual malice, or malice in fact. The error permitted the jury to find defendant guilty without finding that she harbored ill will, hatred, spite, or an evil intent when she punished her son, thereby reducing the State's burden of proof on an essential element of the offense charged. The failure to use the correct definition was fundamental error as the essential element of malice was disputed at trial, and was material to what the jury had to consider to convict defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was quashed and remanded for further proceedings in accord with the decision. The decision was to be retroactively applied to cases pending on direct review or not yet final. The decision was expressly limited in its retroactive application to nonfinal cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner killed a man and was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. In a postconviction proceeding, the trial court denied a motion to vacate the conviction but vacated the death sentence and ordered a resentencing. The court affirmed and denied a request for habeas corpus relief. The court held that petitioner's counsel provided ineffective assistance in spending a mere 18 hours in preparing for the penalty phase. Thus, petitioner's waiver of the introduction of mitigating evidence at sentencing was invalid. Petitioner was properly denied a new trial because he was not denied effective assistance during the guilt phase. There was no violation in failing to disclose pending charges against a State witness because there was no showing of exculpatory value or prejudice. There was no error in denying petitioner's request for the prosecutor's notes because the request was general and the prosecutor's decision on disclosure was final. As to the habeas petition, although it was error to elicit evidence of petitioner's mother's bribery of a witness, the trial court's instructions rendered the error harmless.</SPAN></P>

He was charged with, and convicted of, armed burglary, possession of burglary tools, and resisting arrest without violence. In light of his 15 prior convictions, he was sentenced to life imprisonment on the armed burglary count. The supreme court held jurisprudential upheaval was a major constitutional change of law. The L.B. case clearly was not a decision of that order. It was a routine statutory construction case wherein the court construed the phrase &quot;common pocketknife,&quot; and thus, was an &quot;evolutionary refinement&quot; in the law, i.e., it was a conventional change that afforded new or different guidelines for the courts in applying the law. The supreme court construed and refined the phrase &quot;common pocketknife&quot; in the face of evolving circumstances in the field. The decision thus afforded new or different guidelines for Florida courts to use in applying the statute and was an evolutionary refinement in the law. Thus, defendant was not entitled to retroactive application of the decision in regard to the definition of &quot;weapon&quot; under Fla. Stat. ch. 790.001(13) (1995).</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted his death sentence should be vacated, based on the fact that his friend's sentence was reduced to life and his friend's admission to cutting the victim's neck while she was still alive. The postconviction court found defendant was not entitled to relief, because he was more culpable, as he was the dominant person. The appellate court found the trial court's decision was proper. His friend's sentence did not mandate a resentencing. The trial court found the friend's most recent testimony did not constitute newly discovered evidence, but was simply the latest version of the events surrounding the homicide that was in direct conflict with his prior testimony and other evidence. The appellate court agreed. Defense counsel's strategic decisions were not so unreasonable as to constitute ineffectiveness. Defendant did not make any specific objections to the mistaken jury instruction, but stated merely he renewed every objection previously made. Such a generic objection did not properly preserve the issue, as the trial court could have corrected its error at the time.</SPAN></P>

It was not error to summarily deny the ineffective assistance claim as to the guilt phase counsel, since petitioner did not satisfy either Strickland standard. Petitioner's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a Frye hearing was procedurally barred, as it had not been raised in the Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion. Habeas relief was denied as to the claim that appellate counsel was ineffective for the failure to argue that the trial court erred in failing to hold a Frye hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 17 years old. His 16 year-old girlfriend rented a room from the adult victim. The girlfriend told defendant that the victim was making sexual advances upon her. One night while a teenage friend was staying with the girlfriend, the girlfriend called defendant and told him that the victim had asked the two girls to sleep with him. Defendant went to the victim's home and with the assistance of his girlfriend and her friend beat the victim with a baseball bat, tied the victim up, and transported the victim to a wooded area where they tied the victim to a tree, set him on fire, and slit his throat with a meat cleaver. The supreme court found that (1) the prosecutor's closing argument was not an improper personal attack on defense counsel but a response to defense counsel's own argument to the jury; (2) the trial court abused its discretion in assigning little weight to the mitigator of defendant's age; (3) the trial court's finding of the avoid arrest aggravator was in error; and (4) the statutory mitigator that defendant was 17 years of age was an extremely significant factor that, together with the other mitigation, rendered the death penalty disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's original sentence was corrected and reduced. The State subsequently petitioned for defendant's commitment under the Ryce Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 394.910 et seq. (2000). Defendant petitioned for a writ of prohibition to prevent the trial court from hearing the State's petition. The Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) ordered the trial court to discharge defendant, and then certified a question of great public importance for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified question was whether the Jimmy Ryce Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 394.910 et seq. (2000), applied to persons convicted of sexually violent offenses, before the effective date of the Act, who were not in lawful custody on the effective date of the Act, January 1, 1999. The highest appellate court found that the Act provided, in pertinent part, that it applied to all persons currently in custody who had been convicted of a sexually violent offense, as set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 394.925 (2001). The lower appellate court determined that the custody requirement had to be read to require lawful custody. The highest appellate court agreed. Requiring only actual custody, even if unlawful, could produce unreasonable, harsh, or absurd consequences that would be contrary to public policy. In the instant case, defendant's sentence should have expired before the effective date of the Act. Therefore, the highest appellate court found that it would be fundamentally unfair not to give defendant the benefit of his operative release date. Accordingly, the Ryce Act was found to be limited to persons who were in lawful custody on its effective date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified question was answered in the negative, and the decision below was approved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a prisoner under sentence of death and an active death warrant, petitioned the Florida Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus. He sought relief pursuant to Ring, wherein the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional the Arizona capital sentencing statute to the extent that it allowed a sentencing judge, sitting without a jury, to find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Supreme Court stayed defendant's execution and placed his case in abeyance while it decided Ring. It then issued its decision in Ring, summarily denied defendant's petition for certiorari, and lifted the stay without mentioning Ring in defendant's order. The United States Supreme Court did not direct the Florida Supreme Court to reconsider defendant's case in light of Ring. Significantly, the United States Supreme Court repeatedly reviewed and upheld Florida's capital sentencing statute over the past quarter of a century and, although defendant contended that there were areas of irreconcilable conflict in that precedent, the United States Supreme Court in Ring did not address that issue. As the United States Supreme Court stated that, if its precedent had direct application in a case, yet appeared to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the other courts should follow the case that directly controlled, leaving to the United States Supreme Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions, defendant's petition had to be denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's petition for habeas relief was denied. The stay of execution was to terminate at 5 p.m. on the 30th day following the filing of the opinion. No motion for rehearing was to be allowed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old. Two experts testified that defendant was a sexual sadist and had an antisocial personality disorder. The trial court found defendant to be a sexually violent predator and ordered him to be confined in a secure facility for control, care, and treatment until his mental abnormality or personality disorder changed so that it was safe for him to be at large. Defendant's expert testified that supervision through probation was sufficient treatment. The supreme court agreed that the Act was not unconstitutional under the Ex Post Facto, Double Jeopardy, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses. The Kansas statute that was upheld by the United States Supreme Court's Hendricks decision was compared and found similar to the Act. The Act was not so punitive as to be considered a criminal rather than civil statute, even though detention and medical treatment under the Act started after incarceration for the underlying crime was complete and even though there was evidence that treatment might not ever be effective. The Constitution did not prevent a State from detaining those who posed a high likelihood of danger to others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a 78-year-old female victim's home by climbing through the bathroom window, sexually assaulted the victim in her bed, took her car keys from her purse, placed her in her car trunk, drove around for a period of hours, drove to an orange grove (where he apparently intended to leave her), got stuck in sand, and was pulled out with a witness's assistance, sped off, drove to another location, let the victim out of the trunk, dragged her 175 feet, attempted to strangle her with his bare hands, emptied the contents of a fire extinguisher into her mouth, forced a tire iron into her mouth and through the back of her head, and killed her. The Supreme Court, in affirming, found that defendant's statements to police were properly not suppressed, as they were voluntary. Police use of a &quot;proper burial&quot; technique did not make the otherwise voluntary statement coerced and inadmissible. The statutory aggravators discussed and found were: (1) avoiding arrest (defendant could have escaped, so the reason to kill was to eliminate a witness); (2) cold, calculated premeditation (based on the time-consuming manner of killing); and (3) especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.</SPAN></P>

The trial court followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed an order of the circuit court denying his motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. Defendant also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was found bound and stabbed to death in her apartment. Defendant lived near the victim and admitted that he knew the victim. Defendant's fingerprints were found on an opened jar of cold cream beside the victim's body, on a VCR that was stolen from the victim, and on a pawn ticket defendant received for the VCR. Defendant said that he was home sick when the victim was killed and that he found the VCR by a trash dumpster. Defendant alleged that his various counsel in the proceeding failed to provide him with the proper assistance and that further mitigating evidence should have been submitted. The supreme court concluded that the circuit court properly applied the law and did not err in denying defendant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion after defendant declined to proceed with an evidentiary hearing on his ineffectiveness of counsel claim vis-a-vis hair and semen specimens found at the crime scene. Further, in light of the mitigating testimony that was presented at trial, and the aggravated nature of the murder in the case, defendant's newly proffered mitigation evidence was not sufficiently compelling to have changed the outcome of the penalty phase proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of defendant's motion for postconviction relief was affirmed. The petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were convicted of a number of offenses and sentenced to prison. They were released and placed on conditional release. They both violated the terms of their release, and their supervision was revoked. Their sentences were audited and they were given overcrowding credits for their previous confinement. Those credits were then forfeited due to the conditional release revocations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners claimed that at the time of their pleas they were not informed that they were eligible for placement in the conditional release program. Under that program, any gain time they received was converted into conditional release supervision upon their release from prison. Petitioners' gain time was forfeited when the conditional release was revoked. Petitioners argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 947.1405 (2001) was a recidivist statute, which required notice and an opportunity to be heard at sentencing. The court found that it was not a recidivist statute. Because the conditional release did not impose an enhanced criminal penalty or sentence, no actual notice of an offender's eligibility for the program was required. In addition, everyone, including petitioners, was considered to have constructive knowledge of the applicable law. The program did not violate separation of powers, as the power to place inmates on supervision flowed from the Florida Constitution. It was not a bill of attainder because it did not punish individuals for acts already committed. The forfeiture of overcrowding credits was proper as the accrual date, and not the posting date, was the relevant date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature had proposed a constitutional amendment which would require a fiscal impact statement to be placed on the ballot for all future proposed constitutional amendments by initiative. The issue was whether 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 390 was necessary to ensure ballot integrity. The supreme court held it was not. The requirements for exercising the power to amend the constitution by initiative were set forth in Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3. If those requirements were met, then the sponsor of an initiative had the right to place the initiative on the ballot. However, with the passage of 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 390, an initiative's appearance on the ballot would have been substantially altered, due to the addition of the fiscal impact statement. The effect would have been to weaken the power of the initiative process. Hence, the appellate court was unable to conclude that 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 390 was necessary to ensure ballot integrity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rate of pay for conflict attorneys appointed in capital cases was at issue. Petitioner attorney was awarded $ 50/hour, which was affirmed by the First District Court of Appeal (Florida), which certified a question of great public importance. A second attorney was awarded $ 100/hour, which was reversed and lowered to $ 50/hour, by the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida), which also certified a question. The cases were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The higher appellate court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 925.036(1) (1997) clearly contemplated that reasonable fees would be paid for competent counsel. The chief or senior judge of each circuit had to determine the prevailing hourly rate for similar representation before an hourly rate could properly be established for capital counsel. The first attorney argued that he could not even pay his overhead on the $ 40/hour originally awarded, which was subsequently raised to $ 50/hour. He argued that it was a confiscatory taking of his time, energy, and talents. He asserted that there was no evidence that the chief judge of the district considered the prevailing hourly rate for similar representation rendered in his circuit. The higher appellate court declined to hold that the chief judge did not fulfill his statutory duty to determine the prevailing rate in the total absence of proof that he failed to do so. Inability to cover overhead alone was not sufficient justification to conclude that the right to counsel was negatively impacted. In the instant cases, there was substantial evidence in the record to support the original trial courts' rulings regarding the fees of both attorneys.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision to award the first attorney $ 50/hour was approved. The decision by the lower appellate court to reduce the second attorney's rate of pay from $ 100/hour to $ 50/hour was quashed, and the matter was remanded so that the second attorney would receive compensation at the rate of $ 100/hour, according to the original determination of the trial court. The certified questions, one of which was rephrased, were answered in the negative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with five counts of child abuse involving different children, contrary to Fla. Stat. ch. 827.03(1) (Supp. 1996). The trial court dismissed, finding the statute to be unconstitutional. The District Court of Appeal (Florida) reversed, but certified the question of whether the term &quot;mental injury&quot; in Fla. Stat. ch. 827.03(1)(b) (1996) was unconstitutional because it was vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the term &quot;mental injury&quot; was unconstitutionally vague since it was not defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 827.03. The supreme court disagreed. To withstand a vagueness challenge, a statute had to provide persons of common intelligence and understanding adequate notice of the proscribed conduct. However, the legislature's failure to define a statutory term did not in and of itself render a penal provision unconstitutionally vague. While the legislature could direct that statutes be read in pari materia, the absence of such a directive did not bar construing two statutes in that manner. Fla. Stat. ch. 39, which dealt with protective services for abused and neglected children, defined &quot;mental injury&quot; at Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(44) (Supp. 1998) as an injury to the intellectual or psychological capacity of a child as evidenced by a discernible and substantial impairment in the ability to function within the normal range of performance and behavior. Fla. Stat. ch. 39 was sufficiently related to child abuse to put a citizen on notice that its provisions might be related to the child abuse provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 827.03.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Resentencing under Heggs was a de novo sentencing proceeding. The state's highest appellate court agreed with the Fifth District's decision that if the trial court lawfully could have imposed a multiplier at the time of the original sentencing, then double jeopardy principles were not violated when the trial court on resentencing after a Heggs remand imposed a drug trafficking multiplier, even though the trial court declined to impose the multiplier at the original sentencing. Defendant was not deprived of any reasonable expectation of finality in his original sentence because he challenged his sentence on appeal on a legal basis. On remand, the trial court determined that the maximum sentence under the 1994 guidelines without the multiplier was insufficient, and used its discretion to apply the multiplier. A sentence of 72 months' incarceration resulted. Because the sentence imposed on remand was less than the original sentence imposed, the presumption of vindictiveness did not arise, and defendant failed to establish a due process violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner automobile owners appealed the decision of the District Court of Appeal - Direct Conflict First District (Florida) which, after an appeal by respondent department of highway safety &amp; motor vehicles, held the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the automobile owner's claim for a refund because they had failed to seek relief from the comptroller pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 215.26 (1995).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department had argued the trial court had improperly exercised jurisdiction because the automobile owners had failed to comply with the requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 215.26 (1995) which required the filing of an administrative claim before bringing an action in circuit court. The lower appellate court held the direct file exception in Nemeth applied to facial, rather than as-applied, challenges to the constitutionality of a statute. Since the automobile owners challenged only the agency's interpretation of the statute, the direct file exception did not apply. The supreme court held that since the automobile owners were challenging an agency rule, the administrative process had to be adhered to since adequate remedies may have existed within the administrative realm. Chapter 215.26 permitted the comptroller to give a refund of inspection fees made into the state treasury by error. The automobile owners failed to show that recourse to the administrative process would have been futile since they could have instituted a rule challenge. Thus, their argument that the statute could not provide relief was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a former prisoner, was convicted of armed robbery and second-degree murder for offenses that occurred on May 18, 1990. She filed for a writ of mandamus, contesting the number of days she received for overcrowding credits. Respondent Florida Department of Corrections moved to dismiss as moot, on the basis that the prisoner was released from prison, shortly before oral argument, having completed her sentence without the credits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the issue was of great public importance and likely to recur, the supreme court found that mootness did not destroy its jurisdiction. Petitioner argued that the amended provisional credits statute, which had purportedly gone into effect a few months before her crimes were committed, was unconstitutional because it violated Florida's single subject rule, and because its title was misleading, under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The court agreed. A reading of the title of the Law Enforcement Protection Act, 1989 Fla. Laws ch. 100, required the conclusion that it provided for increased criminal penalties for persons who committed criminal offenses against law enforcement personnel only. The provisional credits general murder exclusion therein was not reasonably connected with the expressed subject, and the statute failed. Removal of the offending provision would not, in any way, hinder the accomplishment of the valid provisions. Since a relevant reenactment had occurred and became effective May 2, 1991, only those persons who were excluded from receiving provisional credits who committed their offenses on or after January 1, 1990, and before May 2, 1991, were entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss was denied. Petitioner was entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city contended that the court of appeals erred in finding that that Fla. Stat. ch. 218.503(5)(a) (1999), was a special law which authorized imposition of non-ad valorem taxes in violation of the Florida Constitution. The supreme court disagreed. First, the population classification was nothing more than a descriptive technique used to identify three particular municipalities to which the statute applied. Limiting the statute as such was tantamount to restricting it to those particular municipalities that met the population threshold on the effective date. Second, the statute did not operate uniformly among similarly situated municipalities because it did not apply to all municipalities. As a result of the combination of the population threshold and the limiting date, the statute by its express terms forever excluded any other municipalities that increased in size to meet the population threshold after said date. Third, the statute employed an arbitrary classification scheme because it contained a classification incapable of generic application, and fixed so as to preclude additional entities from satisfying the requirements for inclusion at some future point in time.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court held that the inmate's appeal was not taken in good faith. After the department received the order, it conducted disciplinary procedures, gave the inmate prior notice, and a hearing. The inmate was not restrained from speaking or filing a lawsuit. Sections 944.279, .28 in no way prohibited him from exercising his First Amendment rights or gaining access to the courts; they simply provided for discipline when the inmate engaged in misconduct by filing a frivolous lawsuit.

Because defendant failed to adduce any evidence of vindictiveness or to even argue vindictiveness, he did not demonstrate that the code violated his right to appeal or unconstitutionally limited his access to the courts. Separation of powers was not violated since the imposition of concurrent and consecutive sentences was one of substantive law.

He filed for postconviction relief, under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised 14 claims on appeal, which included a claim that the lower court failed to properly consider several items of evidence withheld by the State. In rejecting this argument, the appellate court found that no material evidence was withheld and there was no prejudice. There were no inconsistencies between the items withheld and the trial testimony, and defendant did not show how the items could have been used to impeach the witnesses. Defendant also argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, as counsel failed to properly object to the lower court's conducting an independent investigation prior to sentencing. Although strongly disapproving of the lower court's actions, the appellate court found that the information relied upon at sentencing, to support the aggravating factors, was otherwise proven at trial. In addition, the lower court informed the parties of what it did. Given the overwhelming evidence supporting the aggravating factors, the error, if any, was harmless. Some of defendant's other arguments were procedurally barred, and defendant's absence from certain trial court proceedings was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer sought to transfer package liquor licenses to two new store locations that were within 5000 feet of existing package stores. Orange County, Fla., Code of Ordinances &sect; 38-1414(b) (1993) prohibited such action. The trial court affirmed the ordinance, reasoning that the county's regulation was substantially related to a legitimate government goal. The appellate court found that the government failed to carry its burden of demonstrating a reasonable relationship of the ordinance to public health, morals, and welfare. On appeal, the court found that the trial court correctly determined that the subject ordinance was within constitutional parameters, as nothing demonstrated that the 5000 foot restriction was arbitrary and capricious or unrelated to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Orange County. The challenged ordinance was a valid exercise of police power, bearing a substantial relationship to the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his habitual felony offender sentence violated double jeopardy, as he also received an enhanced sentence for committing battery on a law enforcement officer. Although Fla. Stat. ch. 784.07 (Supp. 1998) was characterized as an enhancement statute in a previous case, the highest appellate court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 784.07 (Supp. 1998) actually reclassified enumerated offenses. There was a qualitative difference between a statute that reclassified enumerated offenses committed against law enforcement officers and enhancement statutes such as the habitual offender statute, which cut across some or all criminal statutes. The application of both statutes was not an improper double enhancement, as the determination of punishment for crimes was a legislative matter. The Double Jeopardy Clause did no more than prevent a sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended. The statutes involved in the instant case were read in pari materia. There was no error in defendant's being sentenced for being a habitual felony offender, as a result of his battery on a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The court held that although such claims were recognizable in a habeas petition, claims raised in a habeas petition which were raised in prior proceedings and which had been previously decided on the merits in those proceedings were procedurally barred in the habeas petition. It was improper to argue in a habeas petition a variant to a claim previously decided. Three of defendant's claims were procedurally barred because the court previously addressed those claims or a variant to those claims. Trial counsel did not preserve three other claims of error, so appellate counsel could not have been ineffective for raising those claims unless they constituted fundamental error. Defendant failed to demonstrate how an off the record discussion between the trial judge and the prosecutor prejudiced him. A remark made by the prosecutor and certain courtroom commotion did not amount to fundamental error. Because the trial court did not consider nonstatutory aggravating circumstances, defendant failed to show that his appellate counsel was ineffective for not arguing the claim on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's initial conviction for first-degree murder was reversed on appeal. Upon retrial, a jury again convicted him of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed. He filed a motion and then amended his motion for postconviction relief, under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, which was summarily denied, after a Huff hearing, by the Circuit Court in and for Indian River County (Florida). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing regarding whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to present a voluntary intoxication defense. In agreeing, the appellate court found that the record showed that the evidence could have supported such a defense. Defense counsel, however, never argued voluntary intoxication. Defense counsel never presented any evidence that supported it. Defense counsel also never mentioned voluntary intoxication during closing arguments, and never discussed how the evidence could have supported this theory or how cocaine affected the user. Moreover, numerous witnesses testified that defendant had a history of serious drug abuse. Since voluntary intoxication was an available defense, and the record was inconclusive as to why counsel did not advance the defense, it was error not to afford defendant an evidentiary hearing on the failure to present it. Defendant also argued that counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce various mitigating circumstances. The appellate court found that there was no reasonable probability that the additional factors would have affected the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the claims relating to whether counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a voluntary intoxication defense and the related subclaims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death for murder. The conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the rule prohibiting his lawyers from interviewing the jurors, Fla. R. Bar 4-3.5(d)(4), was unconstitutional. In addition, he claimed counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue on direct appeal. The supreme court found that because no objection was raised at trial, appellate counsel could only be deemed ineffective if the failure to raise the constitutionality of the rule rose to the level of fundamental error. The court concluded that defendant failed to demonstrate any error, let alone fundamental error, as there was no indication of juror misconduct. The court previously rejected similar constitutional challenges. Defendant's claim had no merit, and counsel could not be ineffective for failing to raise a meritless claim. Defendant also argued that the jury should have been told it was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravators outweighed the mitigators before recommending a sentence of death, and that the failure to give this instruction was erroneous in light of Apprendi. The court found that it had repeatedly rejected the argument that Apprendi applied to capital sentencing schemes. Therefore, the argument was without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 1995 sentencing guidelines sheet was prepared for defendant's sentencing. The trial court sentenced defendant to an upward departure outside the guidelines to 96 months' imprisonment, with a 3-year minimum mandatory sentence due to the use of a firearm. Defendant argued that the sentence was improper because 1994 sentencing guidelines sheet, which mandated a lower sentencing range, should have been used in her case. On appeal, the court found that defendant was not adversely affected by application of the 1995 guidelines because her sentence of 96 months was an upward departure sentence that could have been imposed under either the 1994 or the 1995 guidelines. The statutory aggravating circumstances cited by the trial court were valid under both the 1994 and the 1995 sentencing guidelines scoresheet. Accordingly, because defendant was not adversely affected by the amendments made in 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 184, she was not entitled to Heggs relief.

The employer notified the police. Defendant voluntarily went with the police. Evidence was found in the trailer. After more than 50 hours of interrogation through an interpreter, with breaks for refreshments, sleep, and two trips to the crime scene, defendant gave the police a written statement. On appeal, the court found that (1) probable cause existed for defendant's arrest; (2) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress his confession; (3) it was not reversible error for the jurors to be photographed; (4) a mattress from the trailer was admissible, even though blood stains on the mattress did not belong to defendant or the victim; (5) the State was able to prove the corpus delicti without the confession; and (6) the aggravating instructors were properly applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner moved for a writ of habeas corpus, while serving a prison sentence for a first-degree scheme to defraud in violation of the Florida Communications Fraud Act, specifically Fla. Stat. ch. 817.034(4)(a)1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contended that the Florida Department of Corrections (department) was precluded from imposing a gain time calculation based on a gain time statute from a year different than that used for sentencing. The court of appeals disagreed. The statute governing a gain time calculation specifically directed the department to calculate the same as of the date the crime was committed. Moreover, because a scheme to defraud was a true continuing offense, Fla. Stat. ch. 944.275(4)(b)3 was applicable. Petitioner's claim that the department's application of the reduced gain time statute was violative of the ex post facto clause was also without merit. Because the gain time statute was in effect when petitioner consummated his offense, there was no unconstitutional retroactive application. Finally, the department's action did not frustrate the legislature's intent to maintain continuity between the sentencing guidelines and gain time statutes. There was no retroactive cancellation of gain time credits, nor did petitioner have any expectation of higher gain time when he consummated his crime nearly 10 months after the reduced gain time statute had taken effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, plaintiff officeholders appealed from judgments, respectively, of the Florida Courts of Appeals for the First and Second District, upholding charter provisions of defendants, city and county, imposing term limits on their offices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A home rule city and a home rule county in Florida each enacted term limitation provisions relating to certain constitutionally authorized officials of local government. The affected officials challenged the provisions as their limitation deadlines approached (in fact, the high court considered one official's appeal despite the expiration of his term while the matter was pending). The high court held that Fla. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4, explicitly set forth the qualifications and disqualifications for certain positions authorized by the Florida Constitution. That section had been amended to permit imposition of term limits on certain officials, but there was no mention of the particular offices involved in the instant appeals. Therefore, since the constitutional provision set forth the only qualifications and disqualifications permitted in the case of constitutionally authorized offices, the local governments exceeded their powers when they attempted to place term limits on them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed both appellate decisions. In the case in which the trial court decision had not been in the officeholders' favor, so that it could not simply be reinstated, the court remanded the matter to the appellate court for further consistent proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Circuit Court in and for Lake County (Florida) of first-degree murder and a sentence of death. The charges resulted from a chain of events within the correctional institute that culminated in a victim's death and an assault upon another victim. The trial court found four aggravating circumstances. While it found no statutory mitigating factors, it found numerous nonstatutory mitigators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant discovered that someone had broken into his personal footlocker and stolen approximately $ 500. Upon making this discovery, he indicated that when he discovered who had stolen from him, he would stab and kill that person, and that he did not care about the consequences. A discovery violation occurred due to an investigator's nondisclosure. However, the State's discovery violation was inadvertent and the defense was not procedurally prejudiced by the violation. Where during cross-examination by the defense, a witness informed the jury that defendant was serving two life sentences, the information did not vitiate the entire trial. The trial court properly gave the jury a proper curative instruction and proceeded with the trial. The State was entitled to decline an offer to stipulate and present evidence concerning the prior felonies. The prosecutorial misrepresentation of the law was harmless error. The trial court received sufficient evidence to conclude that the instant murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated. In comparison with other decisions upholding the imposition of the death penalty, the sentence given defendant was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;House Joint Resolution 1987 is valid and approved as the 2002 reapportionment for the Florida Legislature.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A house joint resolution apportioned the Florida Legislature. Pursuant to Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16(c), the state attorney general (designated as an opponent) filed an original proceeding in the state's highest court, in which it petitioned for a declaratory judgment determining the validity of the apportionment. The proponents at oral argument, supporting the joint resolution, were the state speaker of the house and senate president.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court noted that legislative reapportionment was primarily a matter for legislative consideration and determination. Unless it could be shown that the joint resolution violated a provision of the United States Constitution or the Florida Constitution, the court found that it could not declare the resolution invalid. The maximum deviation from the largest and smallest house districts was 2.79 percent, and the maximum for the senate districts was 0.03 percent. Both were well within the general 10 percent limit. The districts also conformed with the state constitutional contiguity requirements. Claims of racial and language discrimination, as well as claims of political gerrymandering, were fact intensive and required fact development, which the court found were better suited for a trial court. In making its determination in the instant matter, the court found that, to the extent it could do so under the state constitution, it was obligated to consider the Voting Rights Act of 1965, specifically 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1973 (1994). It did so, within the time constraints of Fla. Const. art. III. The supreme court found that no constitutional violation had been shown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the house joint resolution was valid and it was approved as the 2002 apportionment of the state legislature. The holding was without prejudice to the right of any protestor to file an as-applied challenge to the validity of the plan for specified reasons. For such a case, standing was not conferred upon any party involved in the instant case, and issues of standing were to be resolved by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The non-profit electric generation and transmission cooperative provided electricity to its owner-members, one of which was the non-profit electric distribution cooperative.

The non-profit electric generation and transmission cooperative approved a new rate schedule applicable to all of its members. The Rural Utilities Services approved the new schedule. The non-profit electric distribution cooperative alleged that the commission had jurisdiction to hear the complaint pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 366.04(2)(b) (1997). The commission concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to prescribe a wholesale rate structure for a rural electric cooperative. On appeal, the supreme court concluded that the commission did not err in granting the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held, inter alia, that the trial court erred by failing to allow defendant to impeach a witness with the witness's prior inconsistent statements. In light of the impeachment value of the videotaped statements, the exclusion of the statements impermissibly limited defendant's right to cross-examine the key witness against him. The error was compounded when, during closing argument, the State told the jury why they should believe the witness. The trial court also erred in refusing to admit the prior sworn testimony of a former codefendant in both the guilt and the penalty phases of the trial under the prior testimony exception to the hearsay rule. The State had a similar motive in cross-examining the former codefendant, and had cross-examined the former codefendant on his reliability and credibility. Additionally, the prior testimony would have been independently admissible during the penalty phase, as defendant could have used the testimony to show his minor participation, or that he was acting under substantial domination, or both. The trial court also erred by admitting hearsay statements as to the victim's state of mind during the guilt phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, and attempted second-degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge found three aggravating circumstances, no statutory mitigating circumstances, and one nonstatutory mitigating circumstance prior to imposing the death penalty. Defendant raised numerous issues including ineffective counsel. The supreme court concluded that defendant's substantive claims of prosecutorial misconduct could and should have been raised on direct appeal and thus were procedurally barred from consideration in a postconviction motion. It also concluded that defendant received competent, effective assistance of counsel in the presentation of his defense, and to the extent that counsel's performance was less than perfect, defendant was not prejudiced by it. It also determined no Brady violation occurred in defendant's case since the identity was not suppressed by the State, and the officer did not possess any evidence that was favorable to defendant. Any claims relating to pretrial publicity or juror bias were procedurally barred because they were not raised on direct appeal. Defendant's other claims were without merit or were unpreserved. Finally, there was no basis to find his counsel was ineffective for purposes of his habeas petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was not entitled to relief and his petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied. The trial court's denial of postconviction relief was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered the victim and stole his car. The supreme court held defendant's postconviction relief motion showed no ineffective trial counsel assistance for (1) failing to investigate or present mitigating evidence; (2) not discovering an inmate State witness's letter seeking special treatment, which was not Brady material as no &quot;deal&quot; was made; (3) not challenging a State expert because she trained under someone who allegedly exaggerated her qualifications; (4) not raising that the medical examiner was a suspect in his wife's recent death; and (5) not raising the State's failure to give a State witness perjury immunity who allegedly testified falsely at trial. Defendant was not unable to present his case due to underfunding of counsel's office, and he had a mental health expert's competent assistance, who did not have to testify at the penalty phase. None of the issues raised in defendant's habeas petition, including the trial court's instructions on aggravating circumstances, showed his appellate counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, taxpayers, appealed from a decision by the Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) declaring a Florida statute valid and construing a provision of the Florida Constitution, after the taxpayers brought a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit in and for Orange County, which entered judgment on the pleadings for respondent, a water management district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers claimed that non-polluters were constitutionally prohibited from paying for pollution abatement in the Everglades Protection Area (EPA) or the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) because under the Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7(b), polluters were to pay for pollution abatement for the pollution they caused. The taxpayers also sought a declaration that Fla. Stat. ch. 373.4592(8)(a) (Supp. 1994) violated Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7(b), because Fla. Stat. ch. 373.4592(8)(a) (Supp. 1994) prohibited the water management district from raising additional revenues from EAA polluters who were not paying for 100 percent of the costs of abating the pollution they caused. The appellate court held that there was no express language in Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7(b) prohibiting the taxpayers from being required to contribute for pollution abatement in the EPA or EAA. The words &quot;primarily responsible&quot; were given their ordinary meaning, which included a recognition that polluters would not bear the total burden. Other persons or entities also continued to have responsibility. The water management district's levy of taxes was not unconstitutional as applied to the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found by the jury to have taken the victim, whom he and two other co-participants had beaten up, to a remote spot, stabbed her 14 times, and slit her throat. Defendant then gave the knife to one of the other co-participants who also cut her throat. The supreme court had remanded the case to the circuit court for resentencing after the United States Supreme Court in Hichcock v. Dugger held that Florida jury instructions had to permit a jury to consider nonstatutory mitigators. The supreme court affirmed that the trial court, in the resentencing, did not commit error in (1) limiting direct and cross examination of a co-participant with respect to his 25 other felonies, which included a stabbing death in which he blamed another as a perpetrator, by which defendant attempted to show the co-participant either killed the woman or coerced defendant to kill her, (2) disregarding the 22 year gap between killing and resentencing, (3) not finding evidence and instructing on the extreme duress and substantial domination mitigator, (4) considering hindering of law enforcement by killing her to keep her quiet after her beating, and (5) finding the death proportional.</SPAN></P>

In the second case, the intermediate appellate court held that the tax appraiser did have standing to challenge the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 192.042. The appellate court held that although state officers were allowed defensively to raise the question of a law's constitutionality, they were required to presume that legislation affecting their duties was valid, and did not have standing to initiate litigation for the purpose of determining otherwise. An appraiser was not allowed, in an action filed by a property appraiser seeking review of an adverse decision of the VAB which had overturned the appraiser's ad valorem tax assessment on a subject property, within an appeal pursuant to Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was in a single-car crash in which her passenger died. She was hospitalized with injuries and in the course of treatment her blood was drawn. In seeking to prosecute her, the State tried to notify her, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 395.3025(4)(d) (1997), that her hospital records were being subpoenaed. After the failed attempts to serve notice, which failed to include checking driver license records or post office forwarding addresses, both of which would have yielded the correct address, the State used the Fla. Stat. ch. 27.04 (1997) investigative subpoena power. The supreme court found that the State attorney's ch. 27.04 subpoena power could not override Fla. Stat. ch. 395.3025(4)(d)'s notice requirement. However the exclusionary rule did not, because of the State's past transgression, foreclose the State from subpoenaing defendant's records prospectively in a constitutional and statutorily permissible manner. The State had made a good faith effort to comply with ch. 395.3025's procedural requirements. The State could not use information it gathered from improperly obtained patient records when seeking a second subpoena under ch. 395.3025(4)(d).</SPAN></P>

In other words, the statute mandated that he actually serve a minimum of 85 percent of his sentence incarcerated. Defendant challenged this requirement as invalid. However, the general provision that created the requirement for serving 85 percent of the sentence imposed was enacted by Fla. Stat. ch. 95-294, &sect; 2, otherwise known as the Stop Turning Out Prisoners Act. It amended Fla. Stat. ch. 944.275 to provide that all inmates, not just career criminals, with offense dates similar to defendant's, had to serve 85 percent of their sentences.</SPAN></P>

X, &sect; 19, to authorize county voters to approve or disapprove slot machines at existing pari-mutuel facilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the amendment proposal at issue failed to comport with the single subject requirement of Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3. This limitation existed because &sect; 3 did not afford the same opportunity for public hearing and debate that accompanied the proposal and drafting processes. The proposed amendment mandated imposition of a state tax on slot machines which would produce revenue subject to appropriation by the legislature. However, absent amendment to Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7, the proposed amendment would be subject to a two-thirds vote. The initiative purported to create a mechanism for authorizing and taxing slot machines for a particular purpose in the same proposal, which would effectively amend Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7, to remove the new state tax from the ambit of that provision. The ballot summary provided both that the amendment authorize county voters to approve or disapprove slot machines at existing pari-mutuel facilities only and that, by simple majority vote, rather than the two-thirds vote, for new state taxes, the legislature would be required to license, regulate and tax such slot machines, and to use the proceeds for a specified purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent parishioners sued petitioners, a priest and neighborhood and local religious organizations, alleging that the priest molested them on the neighborhood organization's premises; he unlawfully served alcohol; and the organizations were negligent in their hiring, retention, and supervision of him. Dismissal of the suit was reversed by the Third District Court of Appeal (Florida). The priest and organizations sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parishioners were a minor and an adult female who worked for the organizations. They alleged sexual assault and/or battery. The organizations' motion to dismiss argued that resolution of the issues involved internal ecclesiastical decisions of their world organization as required by its law, and therefore the First Amendment barred resolution by the civil court. The court of appeal framed the issue as whether the neighborhood and local organizations had reason to know of their priest's misconduct and did nothing to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm from being inflicted on the parishioners, which did not require inquiry into the religion's religious doctrines and practices. The supreme court addressed the negligence counts and joined the majority of jurisdictions in finding no First Amendment bar to &quot;third-party&quot; tort actions against religious institutions grounded on alleged torts by clergy. Laws establishing standards of conduct implicated neither the Free Exercise nor Establishment Clause unless adherence to those standards interfered more than incidentally with religious belief or activity. The foreseeability inquiry went to the specific danger at issue.</SPAN></P>

Even assuming trial counsel was deficient for not providing additional background information to doctors who examined defendant's competence to stand trial, neither doctor testified that, with the materials, they would have found defendant incompetent. Contrary to defendant's assertion that trial counsel did not present much of an insanity defense, counsel presented lay and expert witnesses. Even with additional information collected by collateral counsel, another doctor acknowledged that it was a close call whether two statutory mental mitigators existed. By not providing trial counsel with requested mitigation-witness names, defendant could not claim ineffective counsel in that regard.

He was provided multiple extensions for review. The supreme court found that his appellate brief only appeared to challenge lack of compliance by the sheriff and state attorney. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting defendant's requests for additional records, given defendant's own delays in reviewing available records and his failure to comply with Fla.

Two isolated State references to defendant as &quot;the devil&quot; did not constitute pervasive prosecutorial misconduct. Thus, defendant's counsel was not deficient for failing to object. To an extent, defendant attempted to use his habeas petition as a substitute or an additional appeal of his postconviction motion.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held the evidence showed the dominant motive for the murder was avoiding petitioner's arrest. Aggravating factors applied to his punishment were not duplicative as the avoiding lawful arrest aggravator focused on his motive; the cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravator focused on how the crime was executed; and the in the course of a robbery or for pecuniary gain aggravator focused on the crime's context. In spite of the trial court's failure to state the individual facets of its finding that the murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated, the evidence was sufficient, and, if it was not, sufficient evidence of four other aggravators existed. Petitioner's shackling before the jury was justified by his attempt to have a witness killed, and he was not prejudiced, as the shackling was concealed. Counsel was not ineffective by not raising these issues. His claim that the death penalty was cruel and unusual because he might be incompetent at the time of his execution was not ripe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lawyer sought a declaration as to his rights under the Registry Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 27.710 (Supp. 1998), and his proposed contract with appellee Executive Director of the Commission on the Administration of Justice in Capital Cases. The trial court permanently enjoined the director from excluding him from the registry. Both sides appealed. The First District Court of Appeal (Florida) certified the case to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lawyer routinely represented death row defendants in postconviction proceedings. A judge appointed him to represent a particular defendant, but the lawyer declined to sign the contract with appellee commission comptroller. Other counsel was appointed. The lawyer alleged (1) that strict application of act's fee limits unconstitutionally curtailed a trial court's power to ensure adequate representation, (2) limits in the act would compel him to violate the rules of professional conduct, and (3) that the director had excluded him from the registry list of available lawyers for such defendants. The supreme court found that the lawyer had standing to seek, and the trial court had jurisdiction to enter, declaratory relief as to the first counts. Although the lawyer never signed the contract, he had been on the list, initiated a meeting with the client, and never declined appointment. Trial courts were authorized to grant fees in excess of the statutory schedule where unusual circumstances existed in capital collateral cases. The professional conduct rules themselves prohibited frivolous claims. The director only excluded the lawyer from the list as to the present client.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the trial court to dissolve the permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, three counts of attempted first-degree murder, and burglary. Four aggravators, no statutory mitigators, and the nonstatutory mitigator that defendant &quot;lacked true parental guidance as a teenager,&quot; were found. He was sentenced to death, which was affirmed. The Circuit Court in and for Duval County (Florida) denied postconviction relief. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had felony convictions. He apparently was an unidentified perpetrator in the robbery of a woman. Later he ordered her to let him in her place. The four females present opened the door to leave and defendant forced his way in and shot them, killing a girl. His theory of defense was that someone else was the shooter, but no such evidence was presented. The supreme court found that there was no evidence that the woman's boyfriend, who had been violent toward her in the past, was the shooter, and defendant presented no such evidence postconviction. Presentation of another potential witness might have allowed that witness's out-of-court identification of defendant as the shooter to come into evidence. Other potential witnesses would have presented cumulative testimony and opened the door to testimony of defendant's juvenile record. His claim that counsel did not adequately prepare was belied by the fact that he pushed counsel to bring his case to trial. Thus his right to effective assistance was not violated. As to the mental health mitigation presented postconviction, its presence at penalty phase would not have led to imposition of a sentence other than death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant cashed a check on a woman's account. The next day she was found dead in her bedroom, killed the previous afternoon, according to the medical examiner. Defendant tried to cash another of her checks and was arrested trying to flee. Her blood was found in his clothing. Defendant claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective in the guilt phase and during voir dire for resentencing, and did not adequately investigate mitigating evidence during the penalty phase. The supreme court found that the trial court should have held an evidentiary hearing on these claims. Upon review of the summary denial of postconviction relief without an evidentiary hearing, the supreme court had to accept defendant's factual allegations as true to the extent they were not refuted by the record. Defendant pointed out that his original counsel called no defense witnesses and was later disbarred. He alleged that information relating to his severe substance abuse and organic brain damage was available to penalty phase counsel. The trial court should have held an evidentiary hearing on defendant's Brady claims. Photos of the victim were relevant to show the extent of her injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of postconviction relief without an evidentiary hearing was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The matter was remanded for the limited purpose of conducting an evidentiary hearing on defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and his Brady claim. The petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's murder conviction and death sentence were affirmed. Twenty years later, his third death warrant, the second after resentencing, was signed. His motion for DNA testing was dismissed. Defendant filed a successive Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 motion which the Circuit Court in and for Pinellas County (Florida) denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's counsel filed public record requests and sought DNA testing of vaginal washings and a rectal swab taken from the murder victim. He also requested testing of hairs. The postconviction court found the DNA request sufficient and ordered the State to respond. The State responded that the washings and swab no longer existed and therefore could not be tested. The trial court found that DNA testing was not known in when the crimes occurred, and the State could not have known that specimens destroyed after other analysis might someday have been scrutinizable for DNA. Defendant showed no bad faith on the State's part. Even in 2002, a medical examiner could destroy such specimens after a year. The supreme court agreed that defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims were procedurally barred. He showed no prejudice from a juror whose father was in law enforcement, which may or may not have been known by defendant's counsel at trial. Although he was convicted on circumstantial evidence, none of it had changed and defendant had no new evidence. There was no law providing repeat DNA testing. Aggravating circumstances did not have to be charged by indictment.</SPAN></P>

Four statutory aggravators, two statutory mitigators, and six nonstatutory mitigators were found. He was sentenced, among other things, to death. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived with his mother, nephews, and aunt next door to two elderly twin widows. A nephew saw defendant walk from his home with a duffel bag in the direction of the widows' home. That day, the two widows were found stabbed to death therein. Evidence revealed that on that day defendant called the nephew and asked him if he had seen the bag's contents, defendant visited his heroin-dealer in a car matching the victims', saw the news about them but did not react, tried to burn items including a lady's pocketbook, and returned home in different clothes without glancing at the taped-off crime scene. The supreme court held that there had been probable cause to arrest him. The record did not show that officers left him in an interrogation room for over three hours in an effort to elicit a statement. Defendant reinitiated statements to police after having requested a lawyer. The trial court properly accepted as race-neutral the State's challenge to a juror who seemingly responded light-heartedly when told of the murder charges. Robbery was not shown to have been an afterthought. The Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5)(m) aggravator was not shown.</SPAN></P>

A six-year preindictment delay did not prejudice defendant, absent record evidence supporting his claim of unavailable witnesses. His unpreserved claim of material differences between the complaint and trial evidence did not require reversal, as he was able to show the jury such differences. Defendant was properly precluded from asking about cannabanoids in the victim's blood, because he did not lay a proper foundation. A detective's direct examination did not elicit hearsay and did not &quot;open the door&quot; to let defendant elicit hearsay on cross-examination, nor did the &quot;rule of completeness&quot; require such cross-examination. Excluding defendant's parents from individual juror voir dire was not error. The State could ask prospective jurors' views on the testimony of an individual granted immunity. The State's guilt phase closing argument could state evidentiary inferences. Defendant did not show an immaturity mitigator. Failure to consider defendant's artistic ability mitigator was harmless. Defendant's relative culpability made his death sentence proportionate to a co-defendant's life sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed the victim in the victim's residence, taking a number of items, including the victim's car keys. Defendant then went outside the residence and took the victim's automobile. To determine whether defendant's prosecution and punishment for robbery and theft of the automobile were barred by double jeopardy, the trial court had to examine the location of the items taken, the lapse of time between the takings, the number of owners of the items taken, and the intervening events between the takings. After defendant took the items from the victim's residence, the robbery was complete. Defendant exited the residence to steal the victim's automobile. Only upon taking the car did the grand theft of the automobile occur. Thus, the taking of the items from inside the residence occurred at a different time and a different place than the taking of the motor vehicle. Although there was only a single victim and there were no acts intervening between the two crimes, the robbery was sufficiently separate in time, place, and circumstances from the theft of the motor vehicle parked outside the residence to constitute distinct and independent criminal acts.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that 1) the State's challenge for cause was proper because the venireperson was unwilling to consider the penalties provided by state law; 2) the nexus between the flight and the murders was strong, and defendants' actions were relevant to consciousness of guilt and did not become an impermissible facet; 3) it was error to admit irrelevant autopsy photographs, but it was harmless given the direct evidence; 4) Apprendi did not apply to capital sentencing schemes, victim impact evidence was properly admitted, and the sentence was proportional given the five aggravating circumstances found: previous violent felony, committed during robbery and arson, for pecuniary gain, commission to avoid arrest; cold, calculated, and premeditated; and heinous, atrocious, and cruel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two accomplices robbed the victims, shot them, and set fire to their home. They fled in the victims' vehicles. One of them testified against defendant and the other accomplice, and received a life sentence. The appellate court held that the State's challenge for cause of a juror who stated she could not impose the death penalty was properly upheld. The finding that defendant was competent to stand trial was supported by the evidence. Any error in admitting an autopsy photo was harmless. Evidence that defendant tried to run down an officer was properly admitted. The evidence, including the accomplice's testimony that defendant killed the victims in both a premeditated manner and during the course of a robbery, burglary, or arson, was sufficient to convict. Aggravating factors were properly applied: that defendant committed the murders to avoid arrest; that they were committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner; that the murders were heinous and cruel, and were committed for pecuniary gain. The death sentence was not disproportionate, and the trial court properly found that the testifying accomplice's conduct had been less culpable than defendant's.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, pleaded no contest in the trial court to felony charges and violation of community control. The Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal (Seminole County) reversed the trial court's adjudication of delinquency and disposition. The State sought review, and the supreme court accepted jurisdiction based on a conflict with other district courts of appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was without counsel at both the plea and the disposition hearings. At the plea hearing, the trial court asked defendant whether he wished to have appointed counsel but made no further inquiry after defendant answered in the negative. The trial court made no inquiry at the disposition hearing with respect to counsel. Defendant did not bring a motion in the trial court to withdraw the plea prior to appealing the judgment. The court of appeal disagreed with decisions from other districts and found that the requirement in criminal cases that appellate review of a plea was precluded absent a motion to withdraw the plea did not apply to juvenile cases. The supreme court held that a juvenile who was represented by counsel could not challenge the plea on appeal without having filed a motion to withdraw. However, the trial court's failure to follow Fla. R. Juv. P. 8.165 to determine whether defendant made a free and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel was fundamental error, and the resulting plea was involuntary as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal's opinion was disapproved to the extent that it held that juveniles were not required to file a motion to withdraw a plea before challenging the validity of the plea, but the result was approved and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court in and for Orange County (Florida) of first-degree murder and second-degree murder. The conviction was affirmed on appeal, as was the denial of his first post-conviction relief motion and petition for writ of habeas corpus. He filed a second post-conviction relief motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's claim for post-conviction relief based on newly discovered evidence had to show the evidence would probably produce an acquittal. A Miranda card defendant had refused to sign after his arrest did not satisfy this requirement due to his subsequent unrelated inculpatory statements. These statements also prevented proof of prejudice from an alleged Brady violation. Evidence that his second-degree murder victim was the type of person who would have resisted defendant's robbery attempt merely bolstered his second-degree murder conviction, instead of first-degree murder. Defendant's inability to obtain juror background information did not support post-conviction relief, in the absence of reasons why the records were not obtained when the first post-conviction relief motion was filed and allegations of specific juror misconduct revealed since that motion. Defendant was not allowed to interview the jurors in the absence of sworn allegations which, if true, would require the trial court to order a new trial. Electrocution and lethal injection were constitutional, as was the statute allowing an inmate to choose between them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court in and for Orange County (Florida) of murder and was sentenced to death after the trial court found him to be competent to stand trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the victim, and two others planned to commit a robbery. The victim drove off and abandoned the others before the robbery was completed. When the victim later entered defendant's apartment, he was immediately grabbed and beaten, bound and gagged, and then forced to wait in a back room when police officers came to the door. After the officers left, the victim was marched outside to a culvert where defendant chastised him for leaving them, told him they would be the last persons he would ever see, and then shot him six times. On appeal, the supreme court found the trial court did not err in (1) finding defendant competent to stand trial; (2) denying defendant's motion for a mistrial after a State's witness referred to defendant's prior criminal record; (3) finding shell casings to be relevant evidence; (4) finding the murder was committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner and was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel; and (5) balancing the aggravating factors against the mitigating factors. Further, admitting evidence of defendant's gang membership was harmless error and the death sentence was proportional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest in the trial court as a habitual offender and was sentenced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) alleged he was sentenced on the predicate offenses in the same proceeding. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(5) (1993), for an offense to count as a prior felony for habitual offender adjudication, defendant had to have been sentenced separately for it from any other prior felony used to establish the adjudication. The State conceded defendant's predicate felony sentences did not meet this requirement. The court of appeal affirmed denial of relief, finding a challenge to the habitual offender adjudication had to be brought under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, and was subject to that rule's two-year limitation period. Because the requisite predicate felonies essential to qualify defendant for habitualization did not exist, his erroneous habitual offender adjudication could be corrected under Rule 3.800(a), so long as the error was apparent from the face of the record. Because defendant did not originally object to his adjudication on the basis of a lack of requisite prior sequential convictions, the State could, on remand, present evidence of other convictions which would satisfy that requirement.</SPAN></P>

The mitigation instructions proposed by defendant and denied by the trial court were adequately covered by the trial court's &quot;catch-all&quot; mitigation instruction and defendant's argument, so the failure to raise the issue on appeal was not ineffective assistance. Defendant did not make the necessary showing in his motions to disqualify the prosecutor's office and the trial court, so failing to argue this on appeal was not ineffective assistance. An admitted driver's license with defendant's picture and another person's name was not used as an improper nonstatutory aggravator, nor was the issue preserved for appeal, so the failure to raise it was not ineffective assistance. Trial counsel also did not object to the prosecutor's argument asking the jury to impose a death sentence, so appellate counsel was not ineffective for not raising this unpreserved issue.</SPAN></P>

At trial, a witness testified, to defendant's surprise and in the jury's presence, concerning defendant being seen on the day of the crime with a gun. The prosecutor was aware of the information prior to trial. Counsel did not request a hearing on whether the prosecutor violated discovery rules by not revealing the information. An evidentiary hearing on the claims was required. Defendant's other ineffective assistance claims on appeal were rejected. Defendant's habeas petition argued appellate counsel should have asserted trial court error by not excusing the juror.

The district court found Fla. Stat.

When they stopped to drop him off, he shot them, and one eventually died. Defendant argued he received ineffective counsel assistance because counsel did not use a voluntary intoxication defense and did not present evidence in the penalty phase of his childhood abuse. Counsel's strategic decision not to use voluntary intoxication, due to defendant's detailed crime accounts, was not ineffective assistance. Neither defendant nor any family member interviewed mentioned childhood abuse. The record did not support defendant's allegations that counsel did not obtain jail records of his suicide attempts or inadequately prepared his mental health expert. The prosecution's failure to provide defendant's jail records was not a Brady violation because the information was equally available to defendant as to the prosecution. The trial court's decision not to remove defendant's shackles before the jury did not abuse discretion as the shackles were unobtrusive, given defendant's stationary position at counsel table during trial, and necessary, given defendant having removed manacles on previous occasions.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 550.615(9)&nbsp;unconstitutional. After the trial court declared the statute unconstitutional, the breeders and the division appealed to the Florida First District Court of Appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The breeders owned a permanent thoroughbred horse racing/sales facility and conducted horse sales. The breeders applied for and received a license to conduct intertrack wagering pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 550.61(8) (Supp. 1990), an earlier version of Fla. Stat. ch. 550.615(9), containing the same licensure criteria. The trial court found the statutory provisions created an impenetrable barrier to all intertrack wagering applicants except the breeders. The Florida Supreme Court agreed. The statute was unconstitutional as a special law enacted under the guise of a general law in violation of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10.  Fla. Stat. ch. 550.615 was enacted to increase revenues at pari-mutuel wagering facilities by providing protection to thoroughbred horse breeders from the state policy against off-track betting, but no rational relationship existed between this purpose and the detailed licensure criteria in the disputed statute. Curiously, the breeders were the only business entity that had ever obtained a nonwagering thoroughbred racing permit.  Fla. Stat. ch. 550.615 violated the equal protection rights of other potential licensees.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the supreme court found that the murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated without any pretense of moral or legal justification. Additionally, the facts supported the avoid arrest aggravator because defendant knew that he was likely to be recognized by some of the employees; defendant was armed with a gun, knife, and rope, and wore gloves during the crime; defendant and co-defendant discussed the need to eliminate witnesses; and then defendant consecutively shot the victims execution style.

Stat. ch. 775.082(1) (1979) made clear that the maximum penalty available for a person convicted of a capital felony was death. Appellate counsel was not ineffective for not raising on appeal an issue with little or no merit. The defendant's claim regarding the unobjected to prosecutorial comments was procedurally barred, because they were raised in his initial brief denying his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion. The defendant's argument over the prosecutorial comments were barred and did not demonstrate a deficiency in counsel's performance that prejudiced him. The defendant's arguments over the prosecutor's discussions of the defendant's sexual behavior were procedurally barred because they were a variant to arguments already made.

The motel and apartment sued the cities for compensation for losses caused by the closures, and both were granted summary judgment. The first intermediate appellate court reversed; the second affirmed. The motel and the second city appealed, and the cases were consolidated, The instant court held that, as the temporary closures rendered the properties economically idle, the cases were to be analyzed under Lucas. Lucas's &quot;nuisance exception&quot;, under which a regulation that eliminated the value of property was not a taking if the purpose of the regulation was to control a public nuisance, applied to the motel but not to the apartment. The motel was the scene of numerous drug- and prostitution-related arrests, and the first city acted reasonably in ordering its temporary closure. No compensation was due the motel. But there was no such record of illegal activity at the apartment, and so closing it for one year was not specifically tailored to abate the drug nuisance, making its closure a compensable taking.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, after a hearing, found defendant to be competent to waive collateral counsel and proceedings. The instant court remanded so that defendant could undergo a mental health evaluation. The trial court appointed three mental health professionals to evaluate him; in their reports, two opined that defendant was competent, the third opined that he was not. The trial court again found defendant to be competent, but again the instant court remanded, ordering a hearing in which the experts would testify in person. At this hearing, all three testified that defendant was competent, and the trial court so ruled. The instant court approved this ruling.

Photos of defendant were admitted because they showed him with guns similar to the murder weapons. Consideration of the denial of defendant's severance motions previously dealt with on appeal was barred. The denial of severance motions not considered on appeal did not abuse discretion. Appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise unpreserved claims objecting to the admission of autopsy photographs. Defendant showed no prejudice from appellate counsel's failure to raise the admission of autopsy photos objected to at trial. Defendant's unpreserved objections to prosecutorial comments did not raise fundamental error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised 20 issues on appeal. Because the record did not conclusively refute his allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase, the appellate court held that the trial court had to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine if counsel failed to investigate defendant's family history and possible mental health mitigators, and whether there was a reasonable possibility that such failure, if any, affected the outcome of the penalty proceeding. The appellate court also found that during the Huff hearing, defendant's counsel did not mention that requested public records had not yet been received. Further, the state attorney stated he had no indication that any public records requests were outstanding and defendant's counsel did not offer any evidence to refute this claim, nor did she explicitly explain which records were outstanding and the purpose for which they were sought. Therefore, the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to compel production of public records was proper. Defendant's other claims were either procedurally barred, insufficiently pled, or meritless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was sentenced under the Prison Releasee Reoffender Act for an offense he committed three months after being released from prison. He challenged the constitutionality of the Act on vagueness grounds, which was rejected by the supreme court. His arguments were the same as those raised in four prior cases before the court, which upheld the Act as constitutional. The publication of the laws and statutes gave all citizens constructive notice of the consequences of their actions. The district court was correct in strictly construing the statute against petitioner, as he was included in the Act's coverage. Moreover, petitioner's related argument, that the legislature simply did not intend for incarcerated persons to be subject to sentencing under the Act, was similarly unavailing. Finally, the argument that the 1999 amendment nullified the 1997 version had no merit. The modification simply added the definition of prison releasee offenders, of which petitioner qualified.</SPAN></P>

Faced with the prospect of a guilty verdict for first-degree murder and in light of the State's evidence, defense counsel's concession was reasonable and did not amount to a constitutional violation. The concession was made to a lesser crime than charged, during rebuttal closing argument, and after a meaningful adversarial testing of the State's case; even if defense counsel had denied prisoner's guilt to any crime, there was no reasonable possibility the jury would have reached a different conclusion. Also, prisoner did not establish any prejudice caused by defense counsel's failure to present the requested mitigating evidence as fact, as opposed to the presentation of that evidence through physician testimony; there was no reasonable probability that re-presenting virtually the same evidence through other witnesses would have altered the outcome in any manner.</SPAN></P>

Defense counsel fully utilized the trial court's considerable leeway in cross-examining state witnesses on sexual battery evidence. Admission of appellant's in-custody statements as to guilt were harmless in relation to the penalty phase. The prosecutor could properly argue that sympathy toward defendant was inappropriate. None of the lawyers who represented appellant throughout the years was ineffective in failing to seek the trial judge's recusal. The trial judge's comment to the parole commission did not constitute a prejudgment of any pending or future motions that appellant might have filed, and was not made outside the official post-sentence investigative process in a manner indicating predisposed bias against appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent had a business relationship with a company engaged in scheduling appointments with chiropractors for persons involved in motor vehicle crashes.

Respondent examined the solicited individuals, determined that treatment was necessary, and later billed their personal injury protection insurance carrier for services rendered. Petitioner acknowledged that respondent's conduct contained no element of fraud.

The statute was facially unambiguous and its legislative history showed fraud was not an element.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of the decision of the Fifth District Court of Appeal, Florida, which affirmed the trial court's denial of his motion for postconviction relief. The Fifth District reasoned that petitioner's improper habitualization was not illegal, and therefore, was not remediable under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) as long as the sentence was within the statutory maximum for the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner received a 40-year sentence as a habitual offender for second-degree murder with a weapon. At the time petitioner committed his offense, the habitual offender statute in existence did not provide an enhanced habitual offender penalty for a defendant who committed a life felony. On review, the supreme court held that a habitual offender sentence was illegal where the habitual offender statute in effect at the time of the offense prohibited the imposition of a habitual offender sentence. Because petitioner received a habitual offender sentence when the existing law did not authorize the imposition of a habitual offender sentence, the supreme court ruled that his sentence was illegal for purposes of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) as a matter of law. It also referred the question of whether Rule 3.800(a) should have been amended to identify specifically those matters that were sufficiently important to be raised at any time to the Criminal Appeals Reform Act Committee and the Florida Bar Criminal Procedure Rules Committee.</SPAN></P>

On the murder charge he was sentenced to death.

The court held to establish ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, petitioner was required to show specific errors indicating counsel's performance fell outside the range of professionally acceptable performance, and the deficient performance compromised the appellate process so as to undermine confidence in the fairness and correctness of the appellate result. The court denied the petition, holding petitioner failed to meet his burden of proof as his appellate counsel could not be deemed ineffective for failing to raise unpreserved or non-meritorious issues on appeal and because the petition was improperly utilized to reargue facts previously decided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was cited for violating a juvenile curfew ordinance. He moved to dismiss the case, arguing the ordinance was unconstitutional because it infringed upon certain fundamental rights, was vague and overly broad, and was inconsistent with state law. The trial court granted the motion, finding parents had a fundamental right to raise their children without governmental intrusion and the ordinance was not narrowly tailored in the least restrictive manner to achieve a compelling governmental interest. The court of appeals reversed, finding the ordinance did not infringe on any fundamental rights of juveniles or parents and found the various exceptions to the ordinance sufficiently narrowed its scope to withstand heightened scrutiny. The court of appeals certified two questions of great public importance asking whether the level of scrutiny it applied in reviewing the constitutionality of the ordinance was appropriate, and whether the ordinance was constitutional. The court quashed the court of appeals decision and remanded, holding the court of appeals erred by employing a heightened standard of scrutiny rather than strict scrutiny review to the ordinance in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged codefendant testified falsely and lacked credibility, rendering the trial judge's override of the jury's life recommendation error. A claim for relief based on newly discovered evidence had to show the evidence would probably result in a life sentence. This version of codefendant's story did not exonerate defendant and only put the codefendant's credibility into doubt, as had already been done at trial. Defendant claimed a person guilty of felony murder was more likely than a person guilty of premeditated murder to receive a death sentence because felony murder automatically established an aggravating factor of murder in the course of another dangerous felony. This claim had been repeatedly denied and was procedurally barred. Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.852(h)(3), as well as Fla. Stat. ch. 119.19 (2000), provided for production of public records after the governor signed a death warrant. The rule was intended to provide for an update of information previously received or requested and not an eleventh hour attempt to delay execution. Defendant's demands were overly broad, of questionable relevance, and unlikely to lead to discoverable evidence.</SPAN></P>

On review, the supreme court found that the record supported the presence of consent as a mitigating factor and further held that the legislature did not intend to preclude a trial court from utilizing Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0016(4)(f) as a basis for imposing a downward departure sentence. The supreme court affirmed the certified questions and concluded that trial judges were not prohibited as a matter of law from imposing a downward departure based on a finding that the victim was an initiator, willing participant, aggressor, or provoker of the incident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated case, appellants sought review of the decision of the District Court of Appeal, Second District, Florida, which declared unconstitutional a portion of Fla. Stat. ch. 196.012(6) (Supp. 1994). The invalidated provision would have created an ad valorem tax exemption for certain private enterprises by statutorily defining these types of activities as serving a governmental, municipal, or public purpose or function.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court found that the operation of the commercial enterprises were purely proprietary, for profit, and not governmental functions. The exemptions contemplated in the legislation at issue related to &quot;governmental-governmental&quot; functions as opposed to &quot;governmental-proprietary&quot; functions; legislatively deeming a governmental-proprietary purpose to be a &quot;governmental-governmental&quot; purpose did not change its true nature and did not result in the constitutional awarding of a tax exemption where, absent the legislation, there clearly could be no exemption. Neither the instant court, nor the legislature could grant ad valorem taxation exemptions not provided for in the constitution.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing and then denied appellant's motion for relief and this appeal followed. Appellant's Brady claims were not supported by exculpatory evidence. Moreover, the Strickland claims were likewise unavailing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed defendant broke into a house while a number of people were present. He robbed the people there and kidnapped a child. Later that day, the child was found dead inside an abandoned car the defendant had taken, with the windows rolled up and the doors closed. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for first-degree felony murder. Moreover, the evidence supported a finding that the murder was committed during the course of a felony. The trial court did not err in denying special jury instructions because defendant failed to prove the instructions given did not adequately cover his theory of defense or that the special instructions were a proper statement of the law that would not mislead and confuse the jury. After being arrested, defendant asked authorities if they could help him get the death penalty. The defendant's state of mind when he made the statement was relevant. The appellate court disagreed that defendant's sentence of death was disproportionate to the crime he committed. Finally, there was no merit to defendant's argument that death by electrocution was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The fundamental issue was whether companies that provided access to the Internet were subject to common-law civil tort causes of action based upon the laws of each of the 50 states, or whether Congress acted to make ISPs immune from such common-law civil actions. The supreme court specifically concurred that 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 230 expressly barred any actions and the supreme court was compelled to give the language of this preemptive law its plain meaning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal, having quashed a trial court order which found that the statutory requirement that courts be closed in termination of parental rights (TPR) proceedings was unconstitutional, certified the question whether Fla. Stat. 39.467(4) (1997) (now Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39.809(4) (2000)) which required mandatory closure of all hearings in TPR proceedings, was valid under the United States and Florida constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a dependency action alleging that petitioners' daughter was made ill and required numerous hospitalizations as a result of petitioner mother's Munchausen-by-Proxy syndrome. The court denied petitioners' motion to close the dependency hearing. The State later moved to terminate petitioners' parental rights (TPR). The trial court declared that the Fla. Stat. 39.467(4) (1997) (now Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39.809(4) (2000)) requirement that the TPR proceeding be closed to the public was unconstitutional. The district court quashed the trial court's order and certified the question of the constitutionality of the statutory closed-court requirement. The supreme court held the legislature had validly declared that public policy required the mandatory closure of TPR proceedings. Because no presumption of openness in juvenile proceedings was constitutionally required, there was no requirement that an order of closure be made only after a case-by-case determination. Petitioners failed to overcome the presumption in favor of the validity of the statute and failed to demonstrate that the statute unconstitutionally usurped the public's right of access to TPR proceedings.</SPAN></P>

However, it certified a question to the instant court to determine whether a previous decision of the court did indeed preclude appellant's &sect; 1983 action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' 23 year-old son was found dead. An officer, employed by appellee city, identified and located, but never communicated with, appellants. Two months after his death, decedent was buried by appellee county. When appellants later learned that their son had been buried, they filed an action against appellees, alleging that the failure to notify them of their son's death was a violation of their due process rights. The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings to appellees. The court of appeals affirmed, but certified the question whether a previous decision of the court had precluded all 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims grounded on interference with an interest in a dead body. The supreme court answered in the negative. The court first determined that appellants had a substantive right to possession of their son's remains for burial. It then held that its previous opinion about the constitutionality of a cornea removal statute, was not inconsistent with recognition of a limited substantive right to a loved one's remains. Finally it concluded that appellants' substantive right was legitimate claim of entitlement entitled to procedural due process under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court, Broward County (Florida), which, following a jury trial, convicted the appellant guilty of first-degree murder and imposed a death penalty sentence on the appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced to death for first-degree murder. Appellant requested a waiver of sentencing proceedings before a jury, which the trial court denied. At the sentencing proceeding, appellant did not present mitigating evidence. As a result, the jury heard only the appellee State's evidence and argument as to why the death penalty should have been imposed. On appeal, the appellant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to consider mitigating evidence present in the record and in denying appellant's request for a waiver of jury sentencing proceedings. The court upheld appellant's conviction, but vacated the death penalty and remanded for new sentencing. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to honor the appellant's waiver. However, the court held that reversible error occurred due to the trial court's decision to afford great weight to the advisory jury's recommendation in imposing the death penalty when that jury did not hear any evidence in mitigation. Notwithstanding the jury's recommendation, the trial court was required to make an independent determination, based on the aggravating and mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's sentence was vacated. Reversible error occurred due to the trial court's decision to afford great weight to the jury's recommendation when that jury did not hear any evidence in mitigation and the defendant had, in fact, requested waiver of the advisory jury. Accordingly, the court vacated the sentence of death and remanded for resentencing proceedings before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping, and robbery and was sentenced to death. He claimed newly discovered evidence had arisen, bearing directly on the denial of his motion to suppress, which arose from the circumstance of defendant being stopped on the New Jersey turnpike while driving the murder victim's stolen car. Defendant asserted that the stop was illegal because it was predicated on impermissible racial or drug profiling. The court held defendant offered nothing that would challenge the his validly stopped vehicle 17 years earlier. Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851(b)(4) was not intended for use by defendants as an 11th hour attempt to delay an execution rather than a focused investigation into some legitimate area of inquiry. Defendant did not show good cause as to why he did not make public records requests until after the death warrant was signed. His death sentence was not applied in an arbitrary and capricious manner, and he was executed on January 11, 2001.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court had ordered the trial court to conduct a manual recount of 9000 contested Miami-Dade County ballots, and also held that uncounted &quot;undervotes&quot; in all Florida counties were to be manually counted. The trial court was ordered to use the standard that a vote was &quot;legal&quot; if there was a clear indication of the intent of the voter, Fla. Stat. ch. 101.5614(5) (2000). The United States Supreme Court released an opinion on December 12, 2000, which held that such a standard violated equal protection rights because it lacked specific standards to ensure equal application, and also mandated that any manual recount would have to have been completed by December 12, 2000. On remand, the state supreme court found that it was impossible under that time frame to adopt adequate standards and make necessary evaluations of vote tabulation equipment. Also, development of a specific, uniform standard for manual recounts was best left to the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in an automobile accident which resulted in the death of a passenger of another vehicle. Without defendant's consent, the law enforcement officers required him to submit to a blood draw pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1933 (1995). He was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol/manslaughter (DUI/manslaughter) and other related charges. Defendant filed a motion to suppress or in the alternative a motion in limine to exclude the blood alcohol test results. The following question was presented: Where the State lays a three-pronged predicate for admissibility of blood-alcohol test results, establishing scientific reliability, was the State entitled to presumptions of impairment? Testing did not occur until some 14 days after the blood draw, which could have impacted the integrity of the blood sample. The absence of maintenance standards rendered Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 11D-8.012.11D-8.012(3) inadequate and inconsistent with the purpose of the implied consent law as it related to ensuring the reliability of test results.

The trial court then denied the State's motion for a rehearing, concluding that ch. 924.07(1)(l) was violative of the Florida Constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court alone had the power to define the scope of interlocutory appeals, such that ch. 924.07(1)(l) was unconstitutional to the extent that it provided the State with the right to an interlocutory appeal not provided by court rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his concurrent 15-year sentences received as a habitual felony offender pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 and a prison releasee reoffender pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(8) following his conviction of sexual battery in the Fourth District Court (Florida).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction pursuant to his guilty plea to a charge of sexual battery, defendant received concurrent 15 year sentences as a habitual felony offender pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1997) and a prison releasee reoffender (PRR) pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(8) (1997), the Prison Releasee Reoffenders Act. Defendant appealed his sentences, contending that the two sentences imposed upon him for a single offense violated double jeopardy and that the PRR classification in the Act violated equal protection. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The imposition of an applicable longer, concurrent term of imprisonment with a PRR mandatory minimum sentence did not violate double jeopardy. However, the imposition of two concurrent equal sentences was error because such sentencing was not authorized by the Act. The Act did not violate equal protection principles, was not an ex post facto law, and did not apply only to prisoners released after its effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentences were affirmed in part and reversed in part. The statutory provision providing for sentencing of prison releasee reoffenders (PRR) did not allow the trial court to sentence defendant to concurrent equal sentences as a PRR and habitual felony offender. The statute did not violate equal protection or double jeopardy prohibition and was not an ex post facto law. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On certification from the District Court of Appeal, First District (Florida), appellants challenged the ruling of the Leon County Circuit Court, which declared several anti-rebate statutes regarding the premiums to be negotiated between title insurance agents and consumers in violation of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a builder and developer, challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. chs. 626.611(11), 626.8437, 626.9541(1)(h)(3.a)., 627.780, 627.782, and 627.783 (1997), and Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 4-186.003(13)(a), which prohibited title insurance agents from negotiating or rebating to their clients any portion of the risk premium charged by title insurers for the issuance of title insurance. Appellee sought the right to negotiate the agent's share of the risk premium only. The trial court ruled that the statutes were unconstitutional. Accepting certification of the question, the court affirmed, holding that to the extent the provisions violated the due process requirements of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. While the legislature had an interest in protecting title insurers and agents against insolvency and insuring quality of services, it could not impose regulations in a manner that harmed the public and violated a citizen's property rights to freely negotiate the cost of services from a provider.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order declaring the statutes unconstitutional was affirmed. Appellants did not explain how a blanket prohibition against title insurance agents' negotiating their portion of the risk premium with their customers promoted a public interest. The statutes violated the right to freely negotiate the cost of services.</SPAN></P>

The testimony regarding the killing of victim's son, a collateral bad act, was relevant to explain appellant's motive for having victim killed and the total domination appellant exerted over his family; thus, it was admissible. Defense counsel did not object when the witnesses read their prepared statements providing victim impact testimony. The failure to contemporaneously object to a comment because it constituted improper victim testimony rendered the claim procedurally barred absent fundamental error. Because the jury was already aware of the child's death, the victim testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant's death sentence was proportionate to other cases where &quot;masterminds&quot; were sentenced to death, even though they did not actually commit the murder.

Petitioner claimed that he had received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when his counsel failed to raise on appeal the denial of numerous pretrial motions and the use of various jury instructions, failed to raise on appeal the improper admission of gruesome photographs, and failed to argue on appeal that error occurred when the trial court failed to file the written sentencing order until eight days after the sentence was imposed. The court denied habeas relief. The underlying issues raised by petitioner were without merit, such that appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise those issues on appeal. The admission of the photographs did not constitute an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court because the photographs were relevant to show the circumstances of the crime and the nature and extent of the victim's injuries.

Stat. ch. 794.011(1)(h) was deemed a general intent crime, and the voluntary intoxication instruction was only applicable to specific intent crimes. The trial court's error in admitting inaudible portions of a videotape was harmless. A detective properly testified regarding what appellant said during the interrogation. The trial court's sentencing order contained a thorough evaluation of the aggravating and mitigating factors; therefore, imposition of the death penalty was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) certified conflict with Williams, which held that certiorari review should be granted where a party's constitutional rights may be abridged by the continuance of the proceedings below and, therefore, such abridgement could not be remedied on final appeal, in action challenging constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 752.01(1)(b) (1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent paternal grandmother of minor child petitioned the trial court for visitation under Fla. Stat. ch. 752.01(1)(b) (1997). Petitioner sought a trial court ruling that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated her right to privacy. However, the trial court refused to rule on the constitutional challenge and granted respondent temporary visitation. Petitioner then petitioned the appellate court for writ of certiorari, which the appellate court denied on the ground that intrusion into the trial court process was not shown to be warranted. The court concluded the appellate court erred in denying certiorari review, reasoning that the trial court's ruling, on its face, directly contravened petitioner's right to privacy and decision-making in rearing her child. Additionally, while the trial court may later determine the forced visitation was unlawful, the harm petitioner sought to avoid would have already been done. Thus, the court agreed with Williams, and concluded the appellate court erred in not granting certiorari review to petitioner and addressing the challenged statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err by refusing to inform the jury regarding the consecutive sentences defendant received for his prior burglary, sexual battery, and aggravated assault convictions.

The trial court did not err in finding the State's reason to be genuine. Defendant was not entitled to a special instruction regarding mitigating circumstances, because the instruction given correctly tracked the standard jury instruction regarding mitigating circumstances, Fla. Std. Jury Instructions (Crim.) 112. The trial court's error in temporarily prohibiting a witness from being in court was harmless.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his first degree murder conviction and death sentence, upon his second retrial for the death of his wife, by the Circuit Court in and for Broward County (Florida) where the trial judge overrode the jury's advisory sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and his roommate told police that appellant's wife disappeared from his boat after the three's boat trip. Appellant's brother told the wife's life-insurers that that was false, the roommate admitted that he had helped appellant in the wife's drowning, and appellant was convicted of murder. The jury, on appellant's second retrial, recommended life in prison, but the trial judge gave the death sentence. The court reversed the conviction, acquitted as to the death sentence, and remanded. Instead of merely referring to a &quot;tip&quot; that changed the case from missing person to murder, a detective state witness had hearsay-testified that the insurers (who did not testify) had received information (inferably supplied by appellant's brother, who did not testify) that it was a murder. The State also improperly used that sequence of events substantively in its closing. The events leading to the investigation were not relevant. The trial judge improperly overrode based on his view of the aggravators and mitigators rather than via Tedder analysis. The life sentence was reasonably based on the roommate's disparate treatment. Appellant's other claims were meritless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction was reversed, death sentence was vacated and appellant was acquitted of it, and case was remanded. Detective's irrelevant, hearsay testimony as to source of tip that led to murder investigation was highly prejudicial. Death sentence override, based on trial judge's view of mitigators and aggravators, of jury life recommendation violated Tedder. Appellant was acquitted of death penalty for cruel and unusual/double jeopardy purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a prisoner under sentence of death, challenged the circuit court's denial of his motion for postconviction relief filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The court affirmed the circuit court's denial. Appellant was convicted in 1982 of kidnapping and first-degree murder in the death of a 10-year-old and was sentenced to death. After several remands and resentencings, appellant asserted in his motion for postconviction relief that counsel was ineffective. The record demonstrated that defense counsel considered other ways in which mental mitigation could have been presented and made a tactical decision to present evidence of appellant's pedophilia. Because appellant did not show any deficiency in counsel's performance, an evidentiary hearing was properly denied. Appellant's final subclaim, that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to a prior violent felony instruction, was procedurally barred because it was decided adversely to appellant on direct appeal and was now being recast as a claim of ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Counsel was not ineffective for strategically choosing to introduce certain evidence. Counsel's failure to object to the remaining comments that appellant claimed were improper did not demonstrate a deficiency that prejudiced appellant. Thus, the circuit court properly denied relief.</SPAN></P>

The court held 24 hours notice of the advisory hearing was insufficient to satisfy minimum due process requirements. The court found because petitioner's failure to appear at the hearing resulted in entrance of a consent by default pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39.462(1)(d), the hearing was in effect a de facto adjudicatory hearing. There was no evidence that such short notice was necessitated by any emergency or potential danger to the children. The opportunity to appeal did not cure the insufficient notice, as the only issue petitioner could argue was his failure to attend the hearing, and he never received a meaningful opportunity to contest the termination of parental rights. The court held petitioner was entitled to appointment of counsel, as he did not knowingly and intelligently waive that right.</SPAN></P>
