</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Marion Circuit Court, Indiana, found that appellant claimants were not entitled to payment from respondent insurer's liquidation estate and dismissed the claim. The claimants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the claimants could not recover twice on the same judgments, and therefore it would reduce the amount of any award on the claim by the amount the claimants recovered on their Alaska judgments from the tortfeasor's bankruptcy estate. The appellate court noted that the claimants' claim against the tortfeasor and the tortfeasor's claim against the insurer were not based on the same cause of action. Because the claimants' claim was completely distinct from the tortfeasor's claim, a distribution from the insurer's liquidation estate on the disputed claim to the tortfeasor's assignee did not implicate the prohibition against double recovery. Based on cases from other jurisdictions and a plain reading of Ind. Code &sect; 27-9-3-34(d), in the insurer's liquidation proceedings, the Alaska judgments were not conclusive evidence of liability or the measure of damages. The owner of the disputed claim had to prove both liability and the measure of damages in the insurer's liquidation proceedings. The Alaska judgments were not conclusive as to the value of the disputed claim in the insurer's liquidation proceedings and this did not render &sect; 27-9-3-34(d)&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded as to the finding that the claimants' claim and tortfeasor's claim were the same; the judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners sought review of a judgment of the Elkhart Circuit Court (Indiana) dismissing their three-count petition for writ of certiorari under Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-4-1003(a) and complaint for declaratory judgment against appellees, the Board of Commissioners of the County of Elkhart (Board) and the Plan Commission of Elkhart County (Commission). The owners took issue with a Board vote to approve a zoning map change (the ordinance).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not err in determining that, as a stand-alone allegation, Count I failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, Ind. R. Trial P. 12(B)(6). Count I only set forth general allegations which were expressly incorporated by reference into Counts II and III. Count II sought a writ of certiorari for the trial court to review the ordinance. Count II was properly dismissed pursuant to Ind. R. Trial P. 12(B)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The plain language of &sect; 36-7-4-1003(a) did not include either the Board or the Commission, the only two defendants named in the complaint. Thus, judicial review by writ of certiorari of a decision of the Board or a recommendation of the Commission was not cognizable. Count III sought a declaratory judgment on the question of whether the ordinance was illegal. The court agreed that the property owners lacked standing to seek declaratory relief. After appellees made a prima facie showing that no genuine issue of material fact existed on the question of the property owners' alleged pecuniary injuries, the owners did not meet their burden. They did not submit any evidence demonstrating a pecuniary loss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Marion Superior Court, Indiana, convicting him for failure to register as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1999, defendant agreed to plead guilty to sexual misconduct with a minor as a Class C felony. The plea agreement provided defendant would comply with the statutory requirements of registering with local law enforcement as a sex offender. However, at that time there was no statutory registration requirement for persons who committed defendant's offense of sexual misconduct with a minor as a Class C felony. In 2001, Ind. Code &sect; 11-8-8-4.5 added a registration requirement for persons convicted of defendant's underlying offense. After being discharged from probation, defendant was arrested for failure to register as a sex offender. That retroactive application of the sex offender registry requirement violated the Indiana constitutional prohibition of ex post facto laws. The Court of Appeals of Indiana declined the State's invitation to enlarge defendant's plea agreement by requiring him to predict changes in the law and to comply with such changes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed a motion for waiver of fees required under Ind. Code &sect; 34-10-1-3  to file a civil complaint against certain prison officials. The Henry Superior Court (Indiana) denied the motion and ordered the clerk not to process the inmate's cause until he paid the appropriate costs in full. The inmate's complaint was subsequently dismissed. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that Ind. Code &sect; 34-10-1-3, prohibiting an inmate who has filed three or more frivolous lawsuits from filing in forma pauperis, violated the Privileges and Immunities clause of Indiana's Constitution, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. He claimed the statute discriminated against incarcerated plaintiffs because it did not impose fees on non-incarcerated plaintiffs who have filed three or more frivolous complaints and that the disparate treatment was not reasonably related to inherent characteristics distinguishing the classes. The court of appeals disagreed. The court noted that incarcerated plaintiffs were inherently distinct because of the withdrawal or limitation of rights associated with incarceration. The court of appeals also noted the courts have been inundated with civil actions filed by incarcerated plaintiffs, many of which were frivolous and that the inmate had filed about 50 lawsuits, many of which were frivolous. The court of appeals found that the State had a legitimate interest in preserving judicial and administrative resources and that the filing fee statute did not deny the inmate access to court; it merely conditioned access on payment of a filing fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee paternal grandparents filed two petitions to adopt their grandchild. Their second adoption petition was granted. Appellants, the child's biological mother and the child's adoptive maternal grandmother, filed a motion to set aside the adoption decree pursuant to Ind. R. Trial P. 60(B)(4). The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) denied the motion. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother gave birth to the child while she was incarcerated. The mother's co-worker became the child's guardian and later adopted the mother as an adult, becoming the child's adoptive maternal grandparent. The paternal grandparents alleged that the mother's consent to the adoption was not necessary due to her abandonment of the child and averred that they could not locate her. Pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 31-19-4.5-2, they gave notice of the adoption petition to the mother by publication in a newspaper. No notice was given to the maternal grandmother. On appeal, the court held that it could not review the issue of the mother's consent because the propriety of the adoption decree was not before the court. Further, the mother failed to show that service of process by publication was inadequate. Finally, a grandparent did not have a liberty interest in visitation with her grandchild. Thus, the maternal grandmother did not show that her due process rights were violated by the adoption statute's failure to require that grandparents receive notice of the adoption proceeding. She also did not show that she was entitled to visitation after the adoption under the Grandparent Visitation Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the mother's appeal as to the issue of consent. The court affirmed the trial court's order denying the motion to set aside the adoption decree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a wrongful death action, plaintiffs, the children of a decedent, challenged summary judgment entered by the Montgomery Superior Court (Indiana) in favor of defendant nurse, arguing that the children of a parent who provided love, care, and affection but no financial or non-financial support should nevertheless be considered dependent children under the Wrongful Death Act, Ind. Code &sect; 34-23-1-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to his demise, the decedent was mentally ill to the extent that he could not support himself or anyone else. In the last six years of his life, he was homeless and had no contact with his children. While incarcerated in a county jail, he hanged himself and died of asphyxiation. His children filed suit against the nurse, alleging that his medical malpractice proximately resulted in the decedent's death by suicide. On review of summary judgment entered in favor of the nurse, the court held that, to prevail under the Wrongful Death Act, Ind. Code &sect; 34-23-1-1 et seq., decedent's children were required to prove that they needed his support and actually received it. They failed to do so because the evidence established that the decedent was never capable of providing financial support or nonpecuniary services to his children. While he may have provided emotional support--a difficult task, given that he was prohibited from having contact with them--emotional support alone was insufficient to establish dependency. The touchstone of the Wrongful Death Act was pecuniary loss, and the children failed to establish any.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-43-4-3 as a lesser included offense of theft. The Allen Superior Court (Indiana) denied the request. The jury found defendant guilty as charged. He appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A loss prevention supervisor at a department store saw defendant stuff numerous clothing items into a large black plastic trash bag on her surveillance video screen. Defendant had been apprehended for shoplifting from the same store 14 months earlier when he stuffed jeans into a trash bag and exited the store. This time, he dropped the bag when he saw the supervisor approaching him and exited without the clothing. On appeal, the court held that it was reversible error to refuse to give defendant's requested instruction describing criminal conversion as a lesser included offense of theft. If criminal conversion as a class A misdemeanor and theft as a class D felony were indeed two different crimes as outlined by Indiana's Legislature, then the trial court abused its discretion by failing to instruct the jury as to the lesser-included offense of conversion. If the elements of conversion and theft had no practical difference, then the rule of lenity and/or the Proportionality Clause contained in Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16 entitled defendant to have the jury instructed on both crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tenant appealed the judgment of the St. Joseph Superior Court (Indiana) that granted appellee, the Housing Authority of South Bend (HASB), prejudgment possession of the apartment unit the tenant had leased from HASB.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant argued, inter alia, that the trial court committed reversible error when it refused to order that the son be transported from prison to testify at the immediate possession hearing. The court of appeals disagreed. The trial court heard testimony &quot;that at the time of the robbery in July 2008, the son maintained a separate household with his pregnant girlfriend.&quot; However, even if the son had moved from the tenant's unit in late February of 2008, the terms of the lease clearly provided that until the tenant provided written notice to HASB of that fact, he was considered to be a resident of the unit. Hence, evidence at the hearing of the son's absence was not relevant to controverting the claim that the tenant had breached the terms of her lease. As to any involvement by the tenant and the son's siblings in his July 2008 crime, neither the lease nor any regulation to which the tenant pointed provide that their non-involvement was the dispositive issue as to whether she should remain a tenant. Moreover, the trial court had evidence of admissions by the son that directly connected his presence in the tenant's unit with the crime he committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Allen Superior Court (Indiana), which convicted him upon a jury verdict of strangulation in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-2-9(b), and battery in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-2-1(a)(2)(M), each as Class D felonies. The jury also found that defendant was an habitual offender. The trial court denied defendant's motion to correct error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived with the victim and her two children, and the couple engaged in sexual intercourse. The victim called 9-1-1 twice after defendant refused to leave her home and then angrily choked her and beat her at length. Her children observed part of the attack. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not deprive defendant of his right to counsel in determining that he knowingly, willingly, and voluntarily exercised his right to self-representation. Defendant was clearly warned of the dangers of representing himself and the advantages of having an attorney. Further, it was harmless error to deny defendant's motion for separation of witnesses under Ind. R. Evid. 615 because there was no prejudice. In addition, Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-2-1(a)(2)(M) was not void for vagueness as applied to defendant. The definition of a &quot;family or household member&quot; under Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-1-10.6(a) as one who &quot;is or was engaged in a sexual relationship with the other person&quot; was sufficiently definite to inform ordinary people of the prohibited conduct and to avoid arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement of the statute. Finally, there was sufficient evidence supporting the battery conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, 45 homeowners in a neighborhood, sued appellants, a city and its board of public works, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging in part that the board's resolution violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution as applied to the homeowners. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) granted the homeowners' request for summary judgment and denied the city's motion for summary judgment. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city assessed each property owner in the neighborhood for a sewer project under the Barrett Law. The 45 homeowners paid the full assessment, while 142 others paid in installments. The next year, the city passed an ordinance abandoning Barrett Law assessments, and the board passed a resolution forgiving future installment payments. The court held that the city's refusal to grant the homeowners' request for a partial refund of their assessments violated the Equal Protection Clause. It was the city's burden to demonstrate a plausible policy reason for its disparate treatment of the homeowners, but it failed to demonstrate a rational basis for the differential treatment. The city only offered attenuated justifications for its failure to treat the similarly situated homeowners with rough equality. It could not lawfully confer privileges upon property owners who paid in installments and, at the same time, impose liabilities upon those within the same class who paid in full. The resolution's only stated policy justification, which was to alleviate financial hardship on middle to lower-income property owners, bore no rational relation to the homeowners' equal protection claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment for the homeowners on their Equal Protection claim, and it affirmed the trial court's denial of the city's motion for summary judgment. The court also affirmed the money judgment entered by the trial court for the homeowners. The court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to determine the appropriate amount of prejudgment interest to which each homeowner was entitled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, two former registered sex offenders (registrants), filed a proposed class action lawsuit against defendants, state and local government officials and entities, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the sex offender registration policy of the Indiana Department of Correction (DOC). The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) dismissed the action, granted summary judgment to the DOC, and denied class action certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each registrant was required to register as a sex offender and received a letter informing him that the ten-year registration had expired. Based on the DOC's interpretation of Ind. Code &sect; 11-8-8-19(a) in effect prior to July 1, 2008, each registrant was required to register again as a sex offender for a second ten-year period for his subsequent DUI offense. The court overturned the summary judgment for defendants. First, the registrants could seek declaratory relief because the burdens imposed by the Indiana Sex Offender Registration Act were such that a possible defense in response to criminal prosecution was not a full and complete remedy. Second, the DOC's interpretation of the statute violated the prohibition on ex post facto laws contained in Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 24. It would impose burdens that had the effect of adding punishment beyond that which could have been imposed when their crimes were committed. Third, application of a residency restriction pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-11 likewise violated Indiana's constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied class action certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendants on the registrants' claims that they were not required to register as sex offenders for a second ten-year period and on one registrant's claim that the residency restriction statute as applied violated his ex post facto rights under the Indiana Constitution. The court affirmed, however, as to the trial court's denial of class action certification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an interlocutory order of the Morgan Superior Court (Indiana) that denied her motion to suppress evidence, arguing that the trial court abused its discretion in applying the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule and denying her motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested pursuant to a warrant on a charge of receiving stolen property.

On review, the court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's suppression motion because the warrant for defendant's arrest was based upon an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official believe in its existence entirely unreasonable. Therefore, the police conduct therefore fell outside of Indiana's good faith exception to the exclusionary rule under Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Hamilton Superior Court (Indiana) that convicted him of robbery, theft, criminal confinement, and resisting law enforcement, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant run into a store, brandish a weapon, and then run out of the store shortly thereafter. During pursuit, the officer assumed a position next to a vehicle; as defendant ran toward the vehicle, the officer emerged, identified himself, and ordered defendant to stop. Defendant turned ran. Because defendant had been running in the direction of the car, the driver's side door was open approximately six inches, and the windows were blacked out, the officer, concerned for his safety, opened the door wider to see if an accomplice was inside. On review, the court held that, under the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the officer to believe that the car was defendant's getaway car and that an accomplice, possibly also armed, might be inside. Further, the officer's search ceased as soon as the exigency concern had dissipated, and nothing in the car was seized until a search warrant was obtained. As such, the exigent circumstance of officer safety justified the warrantless search, and defendant's suppression motion was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff casino patron filed a breach of contract claim against defendant casino, and requested a declaratory judgment providing that he could not be excluded from blackjack for counting cards. The Marion Superior Court, Indiana, granted summary judgment to the casino on both counts. The patron appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The casino patron taught himself to count cards. He and the blackjack pit boss for a casino had ostensibly agreed that he could play blackjack at the casino if he wagered no more than $ 25 per hand. When the patron was barred from the blackjack tables, he filed a complaint for breach of contract and sought declaratory relief. The trial court granted summary judgment to the casino. The Court of Appeals of Indiana held that the casino could not take refuge in the common law right of exclusion, because gambling was subject to strict regulation under Ind. Code &sect; 4-33-1-2(2). The State Lottery Commission did not enact a prohibition against card counting, and the casino did not seek a prohibition by rule amendment. Therefore, the casino patron was entitled to summary judgment on his request for a declaratory judgment that the casino could not exclude him from blackjack because he counted cards. Summary judgment was properly granted for the casino on the patron's contract claim. The designated materials revealed a lack of mutuality of obligation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the trial court's order granting summary judgment to the casino on the patron's breach of contract claim was affirmed; the portion of the order denying the patron's motion for summary judgment on the claim for declaratory relief was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that it had consistently held that landowner associations lacked standing to challenge zoning decisions.

Thus, the association had waived the issue. The association had no legal right--personal or pecuniary--that had been put in jeopardy by the Commissioners' decision. The association has not alleged any direct harm and had not been denied any rights. As a result, the association's claims failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the League of Women Voters of Indiana and the League of Women Voters of Indianapolis, challenged the dismissal of their declaratory judgment action by the Marion Superior Court, Civil Division (Indiana), in which they sought a judicial declaration that the Indian Voter I.D. Law violated the Indiana Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indiana Legislature passed Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 3-10-1-7.2(e), 3-11-8-25.1, and 3-11-10-1.2, which required citizens voting in person to present government-issued photo identification but excepted from the identification requirement persons voting via absentee ballot or those residing at a state licensed care facility where a precinct polling place was located. On review of the superior court ruling, the court held that the Voter I.D. Law violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23, through its disparate treatment between mail-in absentee voters and in-person voters because it was irrational for the legislature to require identification of in-person voters but not to require an affidavit affirming the identity of mail-in voters. Further, the class created by Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 3-10-1-7.2 and 3-11-8-25.1 was based in part upon an arbitrary characteristic that granted an unequal privilege to residents of state licensed care facilities that also happened to be polling places. The privilege granted was unnecessary when those persons already had an opportunity to vote absentee without showing identification. Therefore, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 3-10-1-7.2 and 3-11-8-25.1 violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the superior court was reversed, and the case was remanded with instructions to the superior court to declare the Voter I.D. law void.</SPAN></P>

Further, the State did not enter into evidence either of the packages of drugs that defendant purchased, so the court was unable to review what information regarding the contents of those drugs was contained on the packaging. While the trial court took judicial notice of Food and Drug Administration regulations providing that active ingredients be listed per dosage units and gave examples in metric units, the State failed to prove establish that defendant was capable of converting the metric dosages into grams. As such, the State failed to meet its burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the statue was not void for vagueness. One &quot;beat&quot; an animal when he unnecessarily or cruelly struck an animal and caused the animal to suffer severe pain or injury. Unnecessarily meant needlessly, and cruelly meant to cause suffering. These straightforward definitions were sufficient to inform a person of ordinary intelligent of the proscribed conduct. As such, the statute was not vague on its face or applied to defendant, who kicked a cat. Further, the court rejected the argument that the evidence was insufficient because the cat was not examined by anyone qualified to determine if he was in pain or injured. The record reflected that defendant, while wearing steel-toed boots, drop kicked the cat with such force that the cat was sent flying, the cat made unhappy sounds, and the cat did not want to be picked up by the people who came to his rescue. The cat did not have to be examined by a veterinarian; the factfinder could infer from the evidence that the cat suffered severe pain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to raping a 17-year-old girl and was given terms of incarceration and probation. Shortly before his release from prison, the State moved to add sex offender conditions to defendant's probation. On review of the trial court order, the court held that, under Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-2-1, the trial court had discretion to alter the terms of defendant's probation at any time, even though defendant was not accused of violating the terms of his probation. However, certain conditions were impermissibly vague. The requirement that defendant notify his probation officer of any &quot;dating&quot; relationship was impermissibly vague because it failed to define the conduct that constituted dating. Likewise, the requirement that defendant refrain from engaging in activities that could be construed as enticing children was impermissibly vague because prohibited conduct could include innocuous activities. In addition, requiring defendant to report to his probation officer any incidental contact with persons under the age of 18 was impermissibly vague considering that any number of slight encounters in public could trigger the reporting requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Marion County, Class D felony cases involving persons who, like defendants, had mental health problems were often transferred to Court 8. The State's refusal to waive jury trials in defendants' cases precluded such transfers. The appellate court held the State's alleged policy did not violate defendants' right to effective assistance of counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The negative public perception of mental illness did not mean defendants could not receive a fair trial by jury. As there was no showing that the State's policy related to defendants' mental illness, and as this policy was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose--to seek their convictions--there was no violation of the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. As there was a reasonable relationship between their offense and court assignment and the State's policy (they were charged with serious crimes in a court where the State lacked success in obtaining convictions in bench trials), and as the policy applied to all defendants accused of Class D felonies in Court 8, their was no violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee inmate filed a motion for restoration of credit time classification and Department of Correction (DOC) privileges. Appellant DOC challenged a judgment of the Hamilton Circuit Court (Indiana), which granted the motion and ordered it to restore defendant's classification. The inmate challenged the trial court's decision to grant DOC's motion to correct error after the forty-five days required by Ind. R. Trial P. 53.3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DOC argued that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to review and rule on the inmate's motion because such review required it to pass judgment on the propriety of DOC's disciplinary actions. The court of appeals held that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to review the deprivation of the inmate's credit time after such deprivation occurred pursuant to his claim of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The gravamen of the inmate's claim was based on the constitutionality of certain requirements of DOC's Sex Offender Management and Monitory Treatment Plan program. DOC could violate a prisoner's constitutional right against self-incrimination. DOC could appeal from the trial court's belated grant of its motion to correct error. However, because the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction, it erroneously granted DOC's motion, which was premised on the trial court's alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Therefore, the trial court's original order granting the inmate's motion had to stand. DOC was not denied due process. It received notice in sufficient time to intervene and be heard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals remanded the case with directions that the trial court vacate its grant of the motion to correct error and reinstate its original order in favor of the inmate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a township assessor, individually and on behalf of a class of township assessors, appealed the judgment of the Huntington Circuit Court (Indiana), which dismissed her complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants, the Indiana Governor, the State Commissioner, the Indiana Department of Local Government and Finance, and a county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's suit sought a declaration that various public acts that directed county assessors to take over the duties of the township assessors were unconstitutional. Plaintiff also asserted a claim for contractual tortious interference and sought a preliminary injunction. The court held that since the office of a township assessor was provided for in Ind. Const. art. 6, &sect; 3, its existence necessarily entailed statutory action by the Indiana Legislature. Therefore, the Indiana General Assembly had the authority to curtail the duties, powers, and obligations of an elected township assessor, even during the middle of his or her elected term, and transfer those duties, powers, and obligations to the county assessor. The court likewise upheld the dismissal of plaintiff's tortious interference claims since with regard to a public office, there was no contractual relationship or obligation that could be interfered with since the duties of a public officer are statutorily prescribed. The court did find that standing on the part of defendants existed and that plaintiff had properly brought initiated the declaratory judgment action against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court with regard to its decision that plaintiff improperly brought a declaratory judgment action against defendants but, otherwise, affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prospective parents petitioned to adopt a child. Appellant guardian ad litem (GAL) reported that the adoption was in the child's best interests. The Lake Superior Court (Indiana) found, however, that one of the prospective parents had been convicted in Illinois of aggravated battery, and, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 31-19-11-1(c), denied the petition. The GAL appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The GAL argued that &sect; 31-19-11-1(c) was unconstitutional as applied to the child. The appellate court found, however, that the entries from the Illinois case at issue did not reflect that judgment of conviction was entered or sentence was imposed for the counts charging aggravated battery or armed violence. Although the jury found the prospective parent guilty to aggravated battery, the Illinois trial court &quot;merged&quot; that into attempted murder. Pursuant to Illinois law, because this offense was merged into a greater offense, the offense was vacated. Because the record showed that there were no judgments of conviction entered against the prospective parent except for attempted murder and he was only sentenced for that charge, he was only &quot;convicted&quot; of attempted murder. Attempted murder was not one of the offenses listed in &sect; 31-19-11-1(c). The crime of attempted murder did not appear to impede the adoption petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for the trial court to determine whether adoption was still in the best interests of the child and whether the prospective parents were of sufficient ability to rear the child and furnish suitable support and education.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) of murder, rape, burglary, and criminal confinement. The court imposed the death penalty for the murder conviction and, alternatively, imprisonment if the death penalty was set aside.  The court also imposed consecutive imprisonment terms for the other convictions. The postconviction court set aside the death sentence but upheld the remainder of the sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred upon remand when it adopted, without a sentencing hearing, the alternative sentence of imprisonment originally imposed by the trial court. He further alleged that his alternative sentence was an illegal sentence. On appeal, the court found that the postconviction court granted relief only as to the death penalty. To the extent that defendant's sentence of imprisonment reflected the aggregate sentence imposed for the separate convictions of burglary, criminal confinement, and rape, his claim was waived. In addition, res judicata did not bar his sentencing challenges on their merits. Thus, the original trial court exceeded its statutory authority in imposing defendant's alternative consecutive sentence for murder. The trial court upon remand was to conduct a full sentencing hearing for the murder conviction. Any term in excess of the presumptive sentence under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-3 was to be determined on the basis of aggravating circumstances pursuant to the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial. Finally, defendant waived his challenge to the denial of hiss motion to transfer based upon an allegedly improper change of judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part as to the sentences for the convictions of burglary, criminal confinement, and rape, and reversed in part as to the sentence for the conviction of murder. The cause was remanded for a new sentencing hearing on the murder conviction only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed suit against appellee father's attorney alleging 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and civil conspiracy claims and seeking treble damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court rejected the mother's claim that the attorney was engaged in a conspiracy with the trial court in obtaining an ex parte custody order as the attorney did not act under the color of state law, and was not engaged in a joint action, a concerted effort, or a conspiracy with the trial court. The &sect; 1983 and civil conspiracy claims were properly dismissed. The mother did not show that the alleged ex parte communication between the attorney and the custody court constituted a joint action, a concerted effort, or a conspiracy. Further, a conspiracy to violate &sect; 1983 was not a violation of a state statute independent of a &sect; 1983 violation. The trial court granted a hearing on the attorney's request for attorney's fees. The dismissal order did not implicitly deny the attorney's request. The request was not barred by collateral estoppel as a prior request for attorney's fees was related to a prior matter. Ind. Code &sect; 34-52-1-1(b) (2007) indicated that attorney's fees could be awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action if the trial court deemed them necessary or proper. There was no basis for barring the attorney from requesting attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged an order of the Henry Superior Court (Indiana), which dismissed his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against appellees, the superintendent of a correctional facility and the grievance executive assistant at the facility. The trial court dismissed the complaint as frivolous under the Indiana Frivolous Claim Law, Ind. Code &sect; 34-58-1-2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that defendant deprived him of his rights under the Eighth Amended to the United States Constitution. Because the Indiana Frivolous Claim Law tracked 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1915 and the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1915A, as well as the United States Supreme Court's interpretation of &quot;frivolous&quot; in those statutes, the court of appeals adopted that interpretation. It held that the trial court erred by dismissing the inmate's complaint as frivolous under &sect; 34-58-1-2. The inmate claimed that defendants had control over the temperature of the water in the prison showers and had made it scolding hot. He also alleged that he broke his ankle during recreation time and that the shackles that he was forced to wear when taken out of his cell caused him severe pain. The inmate contended that those actions violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. That was a valid legal theory and conclusion, even if it was eventually determined that the facts alleged were false. The inmate's claims did not meet the United States Supreme Court's standard for factual frivolousness. His complaint did not lack an arguable basis in law or in fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee grandparents filed a petition against appellant mother in the Hendricks Superior Court (Indiana), for visitation under the Indiana Grandparent's Visitation Act, Ind. Code &sect; 31-17-5. Following a hearing, the trial court awarded the grandparents extensive visitation with the mother's child. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents were primarily responsible for caring for the mother's child, who was born out of wedlock, until the child was five years old. When the mother entered into a relationship with another woman, a serious level of discord developed between the mother and the grandparents as the grandparents did not approve of the relationship or the other woman. On appeal, the court noted that the mother's parental rights were a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that the trial court's visitation order was not supported by the findings or the undisputed evidence. The evidence showed that the mother was a reasonable person and had a rational basis for the decision, which she did not come to easily. Further, the presumption was that the mother, who was an undisputed fit parent, had made a decision that was in her child's best interests, and that decision deserved special weight under the law. However, the trial court's findings did not support the conclusion that visitation was in the child's best interests. Accordingly, the grandparents failed to meet their burden and to rebut the presumption accorded to the mother.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order awarding visitation to the grandparents was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant filed a complaint against appellee city in the Clark Superior Court (Indiana), for injunctive and declaratory relief in a challenge to the constitutionality of a city ordinance. The trial court found that the ordinance, which prohibited all sex offenders from ever having unrestricted access to the city's parks and recreation areas, was constitutional and granted summary judgment in favor of the city. The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city ordinance prohibited convicted sex offenders from entering public parks in the city. Though offenders could seek very limited exemptions, the exemption procedure was extraordinarily burdensome and virtually illusory. The claimant was charged, convicted, served the sentence for his crime of sexual battery, and completed his registration requirement before the ordinance was enacted. He argued that the trial court erred by concluding that the city's ordinance prohibiting all sex offenders from ever having unrestricted access to the city's parks and recreation areas was constitutional. Specifically, he argued that the ordinance was facially unconstitutional pursuant to Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 12, and 24 and that it was unconstitutional as applied to him pursuant to the same constitutional provisions because he was no longer required to register as a sex offender. On appeal, the court found that, as applied to the claimant, the ordinance violated the prohibition on ex post facto laws contained in the Indiana Constitution because it imposed burdens that had the effect of adding punishment beyond that which could have been imposed when the crime was committed.</SPAN></P>

The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) granted defendant's motion to suppress and denied the State's motion to correct error. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to suppress, because it claimed that defendant was properly searched incident to his lawful arrest for carrying a handgun and resisting law enforcement. As admitted by defendant, he was initially stopped for a seatbelt violation. The issue before the appellate court was whether the officer permissibly questioned defendant about an unusual bulge in his pants pocket. The appellate court concluded that such a question was not unreasonable. While defendant admitted it was a handgun and produced a permit, the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant after checking with headquarters three separate times and being told that defendant had a felony record, which would invalidate the permit. While the information the officer received was, in fact, incorrect, that did not justify exclusion of the evidence obtained during a search incident to defendant's arrest. Without any indication that the police were reckless in maintaining their records or knowingly made false entries in order to justify false arrests, the appellate court concluded that exclusion was not justified.</SPAN></P>

The cases from other jurisdictions were not uniform in their analysis or in their results. Nevertheless, the court found persuasive guidance from several representative cases which held that the principal character and use of a structure was not changed by some ancillary or accessory use. The court held that the community church was and remained a church and was not converted into a youth program center by reason of its faith-based activities for young people. Bi-weekly Girl Scout troop meetings and mentoring of children by adult members of the congregation were accessory or incidental to the existence and identity as a church. The church was not a youth program center. It remained a church notwithstanding the incidental activities not solely religious in nature.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found him guilty after a bench trial on 40 counts of child exploitation and five counts of dissemination. The appellate court found that the child exploitation convictions could not stand because Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-4 was concerned with creation of the material, and not the downloading of images from a computer and saving copies of them to a CD. It also found that the dissemination convictions had to be reversed because he did not have fair notice that pictures of his genitals were patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole, especially since minors in Indiana could consent to sex at the age of 16.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owner appealed a judgment by the Warrick Superior Court (Indiana) that dismissed its complaint for inverse condemnation against defendants, county board and area planning commission (APC), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; the owner claimed that it was not required to seek and complete the certiorari review process before initiating its inverse condemnation action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's first application for approval of a two-lot subdivision was denied by the APC because it failed to comply with an ordinance's dedication provision. The owner sought certiorari relief. However, it dismissed the action and filed a second application with the APC for approval of a plat that included a dedicated right-of-way in lieu of a setback. Thereafter, the owner sued the county and the APC alleging that the ordinance's dedication requirement constituted a taking without just compensation. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the owner was seeking to avoid the dedication provision, not to be compensated for an actual taking. Therefore, certiorari review would not have been futile. The certiorari court could have taken evidence to supplement the record submitted and entered a declaratory judgment affirming, reversing, or modifying the APC's decision. Therefore, by failing to fully pursue the judicial review remedy available in the certiorari court, the owner failed to exhaust its available administrative remedies. As a result, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the owner's substantive exaction claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions for murder and auto theft, and the finding that he was armed with a deadly weapon when he committed rape and criminal confinement. The appellate court found the evidence sufficient. As for the murder, defendant admitted he had something to do with it and the victim's murder was found to be a probable and natural consequence of defendant's action in taking the victim to the woods and raping her. The fact that defendant was in the car when it left the murder scene supported a finding that he was at least an accomplice to auto theft. The determination that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon was supported by evidence that the gun was pulled when the victim opened the door and the fact that she was killed with a gun at the end of the ordeal, allowing the jury to concluded that defendant and the others had at least constructive possession of the gun at all times. While use of defendant's juvenile adjudications as an aggravator was error, his sentence was upheld based on the fact that the offenses occurred while defendant was on suspended committed and based on the nature and circumstances of the crimes.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 4-33-6-7. Appellee State eventually intervened to defend the statute's validity. Following a bench trial, the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) issued an order entering final judgment in favor of the city, denying the not-for-profit entities' requested relief of a permanent injunction. The non-for-profit entities appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, the city and entered into letter agreements with a gaming license applicant which provided that the applicant would pay a percentage of its gross receipts to the not-for-profit entities as local economic development funds. Later, after an amendment to &sect; 4-33-6-7, and pursuant to the authority granted by that section, the city passed an ordinance to redirect to itself all of the money that the casino had been paying to the not-for-profit entities and its predecessors. The not-for-profit entities argued that &sect; 4-33-6-7 was invalid. However, the appellate court held that, even if that were true, the not-for-profit entities were not entitled to the requested relief. The city always retained the authority to change the recipient of the licensee's local economic development funds and to modify the arrangement encapsulated in the letter agreements, regardless of the constitutionality of &sect; 4-33-6-7. In other words, the licensee was obligated to support the community at a certain level, but it was left to the city to determine the identity of the payees, and the city had the authority to pass a new ordinance changing the identity of the payees at any time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The St. Joseph Superior Court (Indiana) convicted defendant of violating Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-10-16, operating a motor vehicle while privileges were suspended. On appeal, he claimed that &sect; 9-30-10-16(b)'s rebuttable presumption that defendant knew his license was suspended unconstitutionally removed the burden of proof from the State. He also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although defendant waived his constitutional challenge, the court considered it and found that Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-10-16(b) had to be read to declare that, upon proof of one fact, service of a suspension by first class mail at a defendant's last known address, defendant's knowledge of the suspension was presumed or inferred, but this presumption was rebuttable. There was a rational connection between service to a defendant and his knowledge. There was no abuse of discretion in admitting defendant's incomplete driving record into evidence. Defendant's offer of his Notice of Reinstatement did not rebut the presumption of knowledge. Sufficient evidence supported the conviction. The State proved that the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) sent a notice of suspension for being a habitual traffic violator to defendant's address last shown in the BMV records.  Defendant tried to rebut the presumption of knowledge with evidence that other notices from the BMV may have caused him to be confused; but, that evidence did not rebut the presumption because defendant presented no evidence that he had attempted to contact the BMV to determine the status of his driving privileges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional on its face. The court stated that a court should focus on the actual operation of the statute at issue and refrain from speculating upon hypothetical applications; thus, it would focus on whether the statute's application in defendant's case was unconstitutional. It stated that Ind. Code &sect; 35-47-5-2 was rationally calculated to advance the public good and thus was a valid exercise of the State's police power. Furthermore, switchblades, the type of knife that defendant possessed, were not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for self-defense purposes. Moreover, &sect; 35-47-5-2 was limited because it did not prohibit the possession of all knives, but only knives that opened automatically or could be propelled by hand pressure applied to a button, device containing gas, spring, or other device in the handle of the knife. Based upon these conclusions, &sect; 35-47-5-2 did not place a material burden upon the core value of defendant's right to defend herself. Thus, &sect; 35-47-5-2 was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LaPorte Circuit Court (Indiana) denied appellant land owner's motion for summary judgment to quiet title to a railroad-right of-way and for trespass. The owner claimed error in finding that a railroad conveyed a right-of-way easement rather than a fee interest in the property. Appellee grantee under a quitclaim deed from the railroad cross-appealed the finding that he held an easement rather than a fee interest in the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad had filed its intent of abandonment with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). Three 19th century handwritten deeds to the railroad contained, along with the term &quot;a strip of land for a right of way,&quot; language indicating the purpose for which the land was to be used. The court interpreted the deeds as conveying a right of way that was an easement, not a fee. Although the use of the temporal descriptor &quot;forever&quot; favored construction of the deed as conveying a fee simple absolute to the railroad, such language was merely a factor in determining whether the parties intended to grant a fee or an easement. Absent some record of the value of the land in 1881, the consideration paid was not conclusive as to the parties' intent. The ICC had not issued a certificate authorizing abandonment, and the railroad did not remove the tracks until July of 1991; thus, at the time the railroad quitclaimed the property to the grantee, the railroad had not yet statutorily abandoned the property and could convey its interest in the property to the grantee. As such, the trial court properly determined that the grantee held an easement for a railroad right-of-way over the property.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court also denied the campground owner's counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners argued that Steuben Lakes Regional Waste District, Ind., Ordinance No. 2002-03, 2003-06, and 2005-06 were unconstitutionally vague for not defining &quot;mobile home park&quot; or &quot;trailer park.&quot; The court found that: 1) the users of the system were split into classes based on location of the properties; 2) each class was broken into five categories-- residential, commercial, governmental, institutional, and industrial; 3) the terms &quot;mobile home park&quot; and &quot;trailer park&quot; were used interchangeably--the terms were always found in the residential category of each class, but if one of the two terms existed, the other did not; 4) the ordinance's goals and policies were to recoup the costs of installing the new system while charging users for the waste they generated. The court found that the ordinances were sufficiently specific to provide fair warning to users. However, the District'cs claim that the campground owner was properly billed for debt services remained at issue. That owner discharged waste into the sewers although not connected; therefore, the liens levied for unpaid sewer bills were at least bloated, and it was error to grant summary judgment to the District on that claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as to constitutionality of the ordinance, reversed the judgment as to the billing status of the campground owner and  remanded the cause to the trial court to determine what portion of the monthly bills that were not paid were for debt services, and therefore properly billed to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient filed with the Indiana Department of Insurance a medical malpractice complaint against defendant doctor. The doctor filed a motion for a preliminary determination of law on the question of the timeliness of the complaint. The Hamilton Superior Court (Indiana) denied the motion. The doctor filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient complained to the doctor, an internal medicine speciality, about bubbles or crackling in her ears, dizziness, and/or a lack of coordination. The doctor attributed the symptoms to sinusitis or stress. The patient informed her psychiatrist of the assessments made by the doctor and the psychiatrist ordered an MRI, which revealed a tumor growing out of the balance and hearing nerves. The patient underwent surgery and ultimately could not close her left eye, had left facial nerve palsy, and permanently lost hearing in her left ear. The patient filed her complaint exactly two years after her surgery. The issue on appeal was whether the patient filed her complaint within the two-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions in Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1(b) (2004). The appellate court concluded that the trial court erred when it denied the doctor's request for summary judgment based upon the statute of limitations. The last possible date on which the doctor could have rendered a diagnosis supporting the patient's claim was the last time the patient complained to the doctor, a date that was more than two years before the patient filed her claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, individually and as guardian of his daughter, who was injured in a car accident, challenged a decision of the Marion County Superior Court (Indiana) that denied his motion for partial summary judgment and granted summary judgment and final judgment in favor of appellee-intervenor State on the guardian's action to declare the punitive damages statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 34-51-3-6, unconstitutional. The State cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint sought treble damages, attorney's fees and costs under Ind. Code &sect; 35-24-3 et seq. The State argued that the trial court should not have ruled on the merits of the guardian's claim because punitive damages had not been awarded, and the guardian lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The court agreed. The guardian suffered no injury as to the allocation of a punitive damage award because he had not obtained a determination on liability, let alone a determination that he was entitled to punitive damages. The existence of such an award was purely speculative at this point in the proceedings. Until a jury announced a punitive damages award, neither party had a right to any portion of such an award. A record containing the facts essential to establish actual harm was ascertainable only if a trial was held, instructions were given, a jury found for the guardian and awarded punitive damages, the punitive damages were paid to the Court Clerk, and 75% of the award was then paid into the State's Violent Crimes Victims Compensation Fund. Because these events had not occurred, there was no justiciable controversy. Thus, summary judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant neighbors challenged an order of the Huntington Superior Court (Indiana) that granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, a farming operation and its owner, claiming error in interpreting and applying the Indiana Right to Farm Act and claiming that issues of material fact remained as to the neighbors' nuisance, criminal trespass, criminal mischief, and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims against appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The farm was an agricultural operation for the purposes of the Indiana Right to Farm Act, Ind. Code &sect; 32-30-6-1 (2003). The court rejected the claim that the Act was unconstitutional because it granted an easement to the farm over the neighbors' land. The land at issue was owned by the farm, and the neighbors did not designate any evidence to rebut the surveyor's affidavit. The claim that the farm's operation was a nuisance that interfered with the neighbors' use and enjoyment of their land was rejected because the Act barred the suit. There was no allegation that the alleged nuisance resulted from negligent operation. Assuming that the farm committed statutory violations alleged in a preliminary injunction and that the farm owed a statutory duty to the neighbors, the statutory violations could have been considered evidence of negligence, but the neighbors did not show that the violations proximately caused their injuries or that injuries were foreseeable. The neighbors designated no evidence establishing reckless, knowing, or intentional behavior by the farm, and the farm's actions were not &quot;outrageous&quot; behavior.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a certified class of violent offenders, sued appellees, a certified class of state agencies, claiming that inclusion on the Ind. Code &sect; 36-2-13-5.5 registry violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 12, 23. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) entered a preliminary injunction as to the enforcement of lifetime registration. The offenders challenged a 10-year registration requirement. The agencies challenged the bar against lifetime registration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that those who committed lesser crimes that resulted in death did not demonstrate intentional violent deadly behavior toward another person that required compliance with the Registry. There were sufficient inherent differences between murder, voluntary manslaughter, and attempts to commit those crimes, as compared with the other listed offenses resulting in death, to permit the General Assembly to specify different treatment. As such, &sect; 36-2-13-5.5 was constitutional and did not violate &sect; 23. Therefore, the offenders' preliminary injunction argument failed on the first prong, likelihood of success on the merits. Because there was some recidivism among violent offenders after release and community notification about violent offenders was an opportunity for enhancing public safety, the registration requirement for violent offenders met the low threshold of rational relation and did not violate &sect; 12. Ind. Code &sect; 11-8-8-19(d) applied only to sex offenders; accordingly, a violent offender had to comply with the Registry for ten years, unless the offender also fell within Ind. Code &sect; 11-8-8-19(b), (c), or (e), in which case lifetime registration was warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To the extent that the trial court's order granted a preliminary injunction against lifetime registration for all violent offenders, the court reversed and remanded the case with instructions to clarify the preliminary injunction consistent with this opinion. In all other respects, the court affirmed the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the Shelby Superior Court (Indiana) that convicted him of operating a motor vehicle while privileges were forfeited for life, a Class C felony, Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the challenged evidence was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure because the police improperly stopped his car for a dangling license plate, a violation of Ind. Code &sect; 9-18-2-26. He claimed that his license plate was secured by two bolts and was not &quot;swinging,&quot; as contemplated by &sect; 9-18-2-26(b)(1). The court found that the movement of the plate, as described by the deputy, fell within the common definition of &quot;swinging.&quot; Even though the deputy discerned the plate information and called it in to dispatch, a safety issue was raised by a non-secure license plate. The deputy was concerned about the plate becoming completely detached and injuring a person or damaging property. Protecting citizens from possible injury was a legitimate public policy objective. The court held that &sect; 9-18-2-26 was not unconstitutionally vague because the ordinary meaning of the word &quot;swinging&quot; was understood by ordinary people and the term did not encourage arbitrary enforcement. The court concluded that the traffic stop was proper and that there was no error in admitting the evidence obtained as a result of the stop.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver challenged an order of the Marion Superior Court, which denied his motion for summary judgment and granted appellee Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) summary judgment in his action seeking to a declaration that Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 9-18-24.5-4 and 9-29-5-34.5 was unconstitutional as violating Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver purchased an &quot;Environment&quot; license plate. He paid an administrative fee and a group fee in addition to regular registration fees. In order to continue displaying the license plate on his vehicle, the driver had to continue to pay his regular registration fees plus the additional fees when he renewed his vehicle registration. The court of appeals held that &sect;&sect; 9-18-24.5-4 and 9-29-5-34.5, which offered the &quot;In God We Trust&quot; license plate without the requirement of paying the administrative fee, were constitutional. The General Assembly's classification system was not arbitrary but was reasonably related to the inherent characteristics of the license plates. Ind. Code chapter 25 license plates imposed additional burdens on the BMV justifying payment of the administrative fee. Based on those additional ministerial tasks, the legislative classification of license plates requiring payment of the administrative fee was reasonably related to the inherent characteristics of the license plates in the class. The requirement of paying the administrative fee was equally applicable to all chapter 25 license plates and did not apply to any non-chapter 25 license plates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought rehearing of a published opinion in which the court affirmed a decision of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) that granted appellee racing commission's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court had held that appellant did not exhaust administrative remedies by raising the constitutionality and legality of 71 Ind. Admin. Code &sect; 11-1-13(d) (Emergency Rule) before the commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties had entered into a settlement resolving an initial dispute without confronting the broader legal issues. Having accepted the benefits of the arrangement, appellant could not argue on appeal that the Emergency Rule was invalid and unconstitutional and that appellant was entitled to a refund of a $ 9 million transfer fee. Appellant could have notified the commission of its reservation of rights to challenge the Rule, filed a declaratory judgment suit and sought expedited handling (due to an impending deadline for a $ 250 million license fee), or sought emergency injunctive relief. Appellant did none of those, instead electing to mislead the commission about its agreement with the transfer fee so appellant could benefit from the commission's favorable decision by reaping a $ 40 million profit. Even if appellant had prevailed, remand would have been necessary because the settlement included specific provisions purporting to prevent appellant from bringing this action and purporting to release claims against the commission and release claims for a refund from the commission. The trial court would have had to consider the settlement's language before ordering a refund money.</SPAN></P>

The Marion Superior Court, Juvenile Division (Indiana) granted the newspaper access to redacted copies of records. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that Ind. Code &sect; 31-39-2-10 applied to both closed and pending cases and to both CHINS and juvenile delinquency cases. It held that the trial court properly granted access to court records in both a closed CHINS case and one that was pending at the time of the child's death. Furthermore, the death of a child was a matter of public interest. The trial court erred in releasing a transcript of a review hearing in the pending CHINS case. A &quot;proceeding&quot; in Ind. Code &sect; 31-32-6-2 was an actual hearing or trial. Moreover, the statute did not say that a trial court could release a transcript of a proceeding from which the public was excluded. The trial court erred under Ind. Code &sect; 31-39-2-8 in granting access to records of the mother's juvenile delinquency proceedings. Her alleged neglect and murder of the child were not the bases for the delinquency allegations. Finally, under Ind. Code &sect; 31-33-18-1.5 the trial court properly granted the newspaper access to Department of Child Services records involving the child. The mother did not argue that the child's death was not the result of abuse, abandonment, or neglect or that the records were otherwise confidential.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the Commission's denial to reopen the record since appellants failed to demonstrate a material change of fact or law as to any issue. The court also held that the Commission did not err by allowing the energy corporation to recover its costs while the facility was under construction as Ind. Code &sect; 8-1-8.8 permitted the same. The court further refused to finding that any of the applicable code sections violated the dormant Commerce Clause since, even if certain portions did, the court would sever those portions and appellants would still be entitled to no relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Commission's grant of the energy corporation's petition.</SPAN></P>

The illegal aliens' had filed a class action against defendant motor vehicle bureau commissioner to challenge recently implemented identification requirements needed to obtain other identification documents. It court then awarded attorney fees and costs to them as &quot;prevailing parties&quot; under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The illegal aliens sued the commissioner claiming they were unable to obtain driver's licenses and/or identification cards because of identification requirements implemented by the bureau. In a prior appeal, the appellate court held that the identification requirements were an administrative rule not promulgated pursuant to required state statutory law regarding administrative rules. The trial court, as  the appellate court directed, entered summary judgment for the illegal aliens and granted their motion for attorney fees and costs as &quot;prevailing parties&quot; pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.  The appellate court found that the illegal aliens were &quot;prevailing parties&quot; under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, and, thus, entitled to such an award. It so concluded because it found that (1) they succeeded on their claim pursuant to the Indiana Administrative Rules and Procedures Act, Ind. Code &sect; 4-22-2-13 et seq., (2) the claim was pendent to substantial federal constitutional claims they raised, (3) their successful claim was derived from operative facts sharing a common nucleus with their federal constitutional claims, and (4) they succeeded in having the identification requirements declared void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant alleged she sustained an injury while working for appellee employer. The Indiana Worker's Compensation Board denied her request for benefits, finding she failed to prove her injury arose out of her employment. The claimant appealed, contending that Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-2-2(a), which placed the burden of proof on employees, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was found unconscious on the floor. She did not remember the events leading up to her fall, but testified the floor was sometimes slick due to oil and water. Her treating physician opined that she fell backwards, causing a concussion with retrograde amnesia. He diagnosed a syncopal episode, but could not rule out the claimant's slipping on the floor. A single hearing member found she experienced a personal event on the job which, while unexplained, was not covered by the Indiana Worker's Compensation Act. The Board affirmed. The claimant argued that &sect; 22-3-2-2(a) was unconstitutional as applied to her because gave her the burden of proving a negative, i.e., that her injury was not the result of a personal health condition. The appellate court held that as the positional risk doctrine announced in Milledge v. The Oaks was not constitutionally mandated, &sect; 22-3-2-2(a), which abrogated that doctrine, was constitutional. As the claimant presented two possibilities for her fall--a syncopal episode (a personal risk not covered by worker's compensation) and a slippery floor (a neutral risk which was covered)--and she bore the burden of proof, her claim was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the Jay Circuit Court (Indiana) that convicted him of drug charges, violations of Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-48-4-1.1; 35-48-4-6.1; 35-48-4-14.5 (2006) and Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-48-4-11; 35-47-5-4.1; 35-41-5-1 (2004). Defendant challenged the admission of  evidence obtained in a search, the constitutionality of &sect; 35-48-4-1.1(a)(2) and violations of double jeopardy and Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-6; and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was on parole in Indiana for a Texas marijuana conviction. He claimed that the search was an investigatory search that was under the guise of a probationary search. The court disagreed, finding that the initial search of the residence was a true parole search and that the search was reasonable. The court found that Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-1.1(a)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague because it adequately advised the public of the proscribed conduct, namely possessing methamphetamine with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine. Convictions for &sect; 35-48-4-1.1, &sect; 35-48-4-14.5 and &sect; 35-41-5-1 did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy and Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-6 because the evidence permitted a reasonable conclusion that two independent offenses were committed for which defendant could be separately punished; the attempt charge, was not a lesser included offense of dealing in methamphetamine. Convictions for &sect; 35-48-4-1.1; &sect; 35-48-4-14.5 and &sect; 35-41-5-1 did not violate the proportionality clause because they were not the same crime; therefore different penalties were appropriate. Section 35-48-4-6.1 was a lesser included offense of &sect; 35-48-4-1.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions for dealing in methamphetamine; dealing in a sawed off shotgun; possession of marijuana; and attempted dealing in methamphetamine. The court vacated the convictions and sentences entered for possession of methamphetamine and possession of chemical reagents or precursors with intent to manufacture a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the Elkhart Superior Court (Indiana), which convicted him on a jury's verdict of guilty on a charge of theft, a violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-43-4-2(a) (2003). The superior court also found that defendant was a habitual offender. Defendant challenged the denial of his mistrial motion,  sufficiency of evidence, habitual offender enhancement, sentence,  admission of evidence, and denial of a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no error in denying a mistrial on a fair cross-section challenge; defendant  presented no evidence as to the representation of African-Americans on jury panels for other trials in the county, and census data alone was insufficient to prove systematic exclusion. There was no error in using an Ohio conviction for receiving stolen property as a requisite felony for purposes of the habitual felony enhancement. Pursuant to Ind. R. Evid. 201(b),(f), the court took judicial notice of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2913.51 and 2929.11 (1987) and found that, because the conviction subjected defendant to possible incarceration of more than one year, it constituted a felony under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-8(g) (2003), Indiana's habitual offender statute. There was no error in applying the 2007 revised version of Ind. Code &sect; 35-34-1-5(b) to allow amendment of the habitual offender information 12 days before trial; defendant's rights were not affected. There was no error in imposing consecutive sentences; defendant had not been discharged from his incarceration when he committed the theft. A pat-down search incident to arrest was proper because there was probable cause for the arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Monroe Circuit Court of Class D felony performing sexual conduct in the presence of a minor under Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-5(c) (2004) and his sentence, following the denial of his motion for dismissal pursuant to Ind. R. Crim. P. 4(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that defendant was not without fault in his counsel's withdrawal; that delay was charged to defendant. Defendant did not object to the State's request for a continuance, even though the trial date was then beyond the Rule 4(C) limit. Defendant waived his right to a speedy trial. Section 35-42-4-5(c) was not void for vagueness. Defendant's hypothetical claims could not demonstrate vagueness. A person of ordinary intelligence would not doubt that the conduct of defendant, who while standing in a doorway masturbated while looking at the children in a room across the hall, was prohibited. Defendant's claim that he did not touch or fondle himself &quot;in the presence&quot; of a child because there was no evidence that the children were aware of defendant's conduct had been rejected. Finally, the evidence supported the conviction. A witness's testimony was not inherently contradictory or coerced, and the &quot;incredible dubiosity&quot; rule did not apply. The witness testified that she saw defendant standing in a doorway across the hall from the bedroom where her two children were in bed, and that defendant was masturbating while looking at the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an interest holder in a race track, challenged a decision of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) that granted the appellees', the state horse racing commission, the race track, and other interest holders, motion to dismiss appellant's complaint regarding a transfer fee assessed in connection with an agreement to redeem appellant's interest in the track pursuant to 71 Ind. Admin. Code &sect; 11-1-13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed error in finding that it had not exhausted administrative remedies. The court disagreed, finding that the timely filing of a petition for judicial review under Ind. Code &sect; 4-21.5-5-2(a) was only one of the requirements for seeking judicial review. Exhaustion was required under Ind. Code &sect; 4-21.5-5-4(a). To the extent that appellant raised the constitutionality of the Emergency Rule (71 Ind. Admin. Code &sect; 11-1-13(d)) in a letter to the commission's counsel, that action was insufficient to exhaust administrative remedies; the issue was not raised before the commission at a hearing. Appellant also failed to show that presentation of the issue to the commission was futile. Appellant filed its petition and negotiated an agreement allowing for a quick resolution. Appellant did not raise the constitutionality issue and accepted the benefits of its agreement and the commission's order allowing the transfer of ownership of its shares in the track. Even if the Rule's unconstitutionality was beyond the agency's power to resolve, exhaustion of remedies could have been required; administrative action may have resolved the case on other grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the statutes criminalizing failure to properly dispose of a dead animal were unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court disagreed, finding that former Ind. Code &sect; 15-2.1-16-20 (2006) (now Ind. Code &sect; 15-17-11-20 (2008)) and former Ind. Code &sect; 15-2.1-21-19 (now Ind. Code &sect; 15-17-18-9 (2008)) could easily be read together as making the knowing or intentional failure to properly dispose of a dead animal a Class D felony and thus the statutes were not unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court also concluded that it was wholly appropriate for animal control to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing defendant's request to sell the animals, in clear contravention of Ind. Code &sect; 35-46-3-6. As for the entry onto the defendant's property, the appellate court found no violation of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, noting that, inter alia, the live malnourished horses were in plain view as officers approached defendant's house while following up on a tip. The appellate court did find, however, that the State failed to present evidence as to the cause of death of the four dead horses to support the charges involving those animals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle was stopped based on a police officer's belief that the tinted windows on the vehicle violated Ind. Code &sect; 9-19-19-4(c). During the stop, the officer asked defendant if he had any illegal narcotics or contraband. After being told a narcotics detection canine had been called, defendant admitted to having marijuana under the driver's seat. The canine confirmed the presence of contraband, defendant was arrested, and during a search at the county jail he was found to also be in possession of cocaine. Defendant argued that the evidence should have been suppressed. The appellate court disagreed, retreating from its decision in Washington and instead following the approach set out by the dissent to that opinion. The questions asked by the officer regarding defendant's possession of narcotics or contraband did not violate Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11 so long as the questions did not materially extend the traffic stop. Defendant did not raise such a contention. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to admit defendant's evidence regarding the tint on his windows. Defendant was never charged with a violation of &sect; 9-19-19-4(c) so the evidence was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

Although the appellate court did not find the term ambiguous, the appellate court agreed with defendant that he was not standing in a public place. However, the appellate court concluded that defendant was visibly nude to persons in a public place, defendant's front yard, in violation of the statute. Defendant also contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because no witness testified they saw his genitalia, pubic area, or buttocks, and he had no specific intent to be seen. The appellate court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support public nudity, as a Class B misdemeanor, but supported public nudity, as a Class C misdemeanor. The evidence included the testimony of an officer that defendant dropped and rolled when lights were turned on him and defendant's testimony he did not want to be seen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for domestic battery as a class D felony by the Huntington Superior Court (Indiana). Defendant argued that the domestic battery statute,&nbsp;Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victim, who had a four-year relationship, had an argument. They continued the argument in their bedroom, which they shared with their child. Defendant &quot;smacked&quot; the victim two times on the face while the victim was on the bed. The child was sleeping in her bed that was about six feet away from defendant and the victim's bed. While the victim was still on the bed, defendant put his arm around the victim's face, and the victim bit defendant. The appellate court held that &sect; 35-42-2-1.3(b)(2) was constitutional and was not vague in defendant's case. Individuals of ordinary intelligence would comprehend &sect; 35-42-2-1.3(b)(2) adequately to inform them of the proscribed conduct and that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. The child did not have to sense the battery under &sect; 35-42-2-1.3(b)(2). Evidence of probative value existed from which the trial court could have found that the child might have been able to see or hear the offense and that defendant was guilty of domestic battery as a class D felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the inmate had waived his claim that the Indiana Penal Code of 1977, Ind.

The issue was available to him at those times, and the inmate did not allege that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. The inmate's claim that he was permitted to raise the issue for the first time in his petition for post-conviction relief because it was fundamental error under Ind. R.P. Post-Conviction Remedies 1 was rejected as it relied on Propes, which had been clearly--if not expressly--overruled. A petitioner in a post-conviction proceeding could allege a claim of fundamental error only when asserting either: (1) deprivation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, or (2) an issue demonstrably unavailable to the petitioner at the time of his or her trial and direct appeal. Neither of those circumstances was present here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant biological mother sought review of an order by the Floyd Circuit Court (Indiana) which denied her motion to set aside an adoption decree in favor of appellee adoptive mother on the basis that Ind. Code &sect; 31-19-14-4 barred her challenge as untimely. The biological mother claimed that the adoption decree, which was entered without notice to her, was void for lack of personal jurisdiction and violated her due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The biological mother lost her place of residence. The trial court subsequently awarded custody of the child to the father. The biological mother paid child support. The father then married the adoptive mother. The adoptive mother petitioned the court to adopt the child. At the time of the adoption petition, the biological mother was over $ 14,000 in arrears on her support obligation and had not contacted the child in over a year. The biological mother did not receive notice of the adoption proceedings. The adoptive mother and father continued to receive child support payments from the biological mother. After the biological mother discovered that the child had been adopted, she filed her motion for relief from judgment alleging, inter alia, that the judgment was void for lack of personal service. The appellate court noted that the trial court determined that a diligent search would have uncovered the biological mother's actual address. Accordingly, the trial court did not have personal jurisdiction over the biological mother, and the adoption proceedings terminating her parental rights were therefore void. Ind. Code &sect; 31-19-14-4 created an unconstitutional due process violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was previously convicted of committing a sex-related offense against a child, defendant owned and resided in a house that was within 1000 feet of a school property, a youth program center, or a public park.

The trial court ruled that Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-11 violated the ex post facto prohibition contained in Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 24 as applied to defendant because defendant had an ownership interest in his residence for years before Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-11 came into effect.

On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err when it found that Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-11 violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 24, as applied to defendant, because Ind.

The court agreed with the county that &sect;&sect; 36-2-13-2.5 and 36-2-13-2.8 were not the exclusive methods of determining a sheriff's salary, and that it could pay its sheriff under &sect; 36-2-5-3. Both &sect;&sect; 36-2-13-2.5 and 36-2-13-2.8 used the term &quot;may,&quot; and the phrase in &sect; 36-2-13-2.8, &quot;any other form of compensation, including a salary contract,&quot; indicated that the third method under &sect; 36-2-5-3 of compensating the sheriff was authorized. The court concluded that the trial court properly granted the county's motion to dismiss. The county was entitled to pay the sheriff under Ind. Code &sect; 36-2-5-3, and that procedure was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) convicted defendant of criminal deviate conduct and attempted rape, violations of Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-42-4-2 and 35-41-5-1. Defendant appealed the convictions and the sentences, arguing that his motion to dismiss the attempted rape charge should have been granted on the ground that Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-1(a)(2) was unconstitutionally vague under U.S. Const. amend. V and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 12, 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case of first impression, the court considered the constitutionality of Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-1(a)(2) and held that, because the statute required that a victim be unaware that a sexual act was occurring, and Rohypnol could result in a victim's outwardly-apparent state of unawareness, the statute adequately informed an individual of ordinary intelligence that sexual intercourse with an individual in a Rohypnol-induced state of unawareness was proscribed. An exhibit that was the test results of the victim's urine sample was properly admitted because it was relevant to show her state of awareness. Because the State did not speculate that defendant administered the drug to her, the exhibit's probative value was not substantially outweighed by a danger of prejudice. There was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the victim was unaware that the sexual act was occurring and that defendant used force to compel her to engage in deviate sexual conduct. While the offenses showed a dark side of defendant's personality, his 34 years as a law-abiding citizen and his position as a contributing member of society were compelling. A downward departure was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as to the convictions, reversed as to the sentences imposed, and remanded the case with instructions to vacate the sentence and impose a term of eight years imprisonment for each conviction, with the sentences to run concurrently, for an aggregate term of eight years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant students, by their parents, filed a class action suit against appellees, the state officials and the Indiana State Board of Education, in the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), for a declaration under Ind. Code &sect; 34-14-1-1 et seq. that Indiana's system of financing schools violated the Education Clause of Ind. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The trial court granted the state officials' and the Board's motion to dismiss. The students appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students contended that the State of Indiana's financing of school corporations was insufficient to provide the students, and the members of the class, with a quality public education that would prepare them to function in a complex society, and to compete successfully with their peers for productive employment and opportunities for higher education. On appeal, the court found that the students properly brought the declaratory judgment action because, accepting all the allegations in the complaint as true, the students presented the court with a question to define the students' legal rights under the Education Clause. Moreover, in line with a declaratory action's purpose, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 34-14-1-1 and 34-14-1-2, the court's response would afford relief from uncertainty and would serve a useful purpose. In addition, the court found that the Education Clause, encapsulated in Ind. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, provided Indiana's children with the right to a public education, as envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. Thus, the students could bring their claim because the Education Clause was subject to judicial enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee filed an action against defendants, two detectives, a police department, and a sheriff's department, in which he alleged civil rights violations, false imprisonment/false arrest, wrongful infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of privacy by intrusion. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) granted defendants' motion to dismiss on the ground that the suit was time-barred under Ind. Code &sect; 34-11-2-4. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that all of plaintiff's claims were based upon the search of plaintiff's home and his arrest, both of which occurred on February 27, 2003. Under a U.S. Supreme Court holding, a limitations period began to run when a false imprisonment ended. Because false imprisonment consisted of detention without legal process, a false imprisonment ended once the victim became held pursuant to legal process. Thus, plaintiff's cause of action for false imprisonment/arrest accrued when he was bound over for trial in March 2003. His other causes of action accrued when his house was searched and he was arrested. Thus, because plaintiff did not file his complaint until 2006, it was barred by the two-year statute of limitations. The continuing wrong doctrine did not toll the limitations period, because plaintiff, who filed a motion to suppress less than a month after his arrest, was immediately aware of the facts concerning the search and the arrest. Fraudulent concealment under Ind. Code &sect; 34-11-5-1 did not apply either. Plaintiff was present during the entire encounter on February 27. He thus had actual knowledge of the facts and was equipped to challenge his unlawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee stepfather filed a petition in the Floyd Circuit Court (Indiana), to modify child visitation. Appellant mother filed a response in which she requested that the court terminate the stepfather's visitation rights because he was not the child's biological father. The trial court entered an order reducing the stepfather's visitation and denying the mother's request for termination of the stepfather's visitation rights. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stepfather and the mother had a child while they were married. They both knew that the stepfather was not the biological father of the child. When the parties divorced, the mother was awarded sole custody of the child and the stepfather was awarded visitation because of his custodial relationship with the child and because visitation was in the child's best interests. The mother argued that the trial court violated the mother's fundamental right under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her child. She maintained that she should have been afforded a parental presumption that her decisions concerning third party visitation with her child were in her child's best interests and should have been accorded special weight. On appeal, the court found that the parental presumption applied to initial visitation proceedings, but not to the modification of visitation. Thus, the trial court's decision that it was not in the child's best interests to terminate the stepfather's visitation was not clearly erroneous as the mother failed to prove that it was in the best interests of her child to terminate visitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) defaulted defendants, a company and president, as a penalty for discovery violations after plaintiff shareholder sued them for breach of fiduciary duty, statutory unpaid wages, and forgery. It then awarded her treble damages under the Crime Victims Statute, as well as attorney fees. In a supplemental proceeding, it ordered garnishment on the president's life insurance policy. The company and president appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The president and the shareholder formed the company, and later each controlled 100 shares of company stock. When the business relationship between them deteriorated, the shareholder sought to sell her 50 percent interest. In a subsequent lawsuit, the president produced a forged document that claimed the shareholder had authorized issuance of stock to two other people, and, thus, she did not have a 50 percent interest. The president and the company produced little in the way of discovery responses. As a discovery sanction, the trial court entered default judgments against them. It then awarded a sum to the shareholder for her 50 percent ownership, which it trebled under the Crime Victim's Statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 34-24-3-1, due to the forgery, unpaid wages, which were also trebled, and attorney fees. The appellate court found that (1) the company could not be held liable for breach of fiduciary duty because that claim was against the president, (2) further proceedings were required to determine whether any exemption from garnishment on the president's life insurance policy was permitted, (3) the president and the company's extreme misconduct warranted the default judgment sanction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment against the company on the shareholder's breach of fiduciary duty claim against the company. It also remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether any of the president's life insurance policy was exempt from execution. Otherwise, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foreign corporation was an Ohio corporation offering and selling waterproofing franchises. It had several Indiana franchisees. It admittedly operated in Indiana in violation of Indiana law because it had not filed a Uniform Franchise Registration Application. The state attorney general then received consumer complaints about the foreign corporation. Pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 4-6-3-3, the state attorney general issued a civil investigative demand (CID) upon the foreign corporation at its Ohio office. The state attorney general then petitioned to enforce the CID; a few days later, the foreign corporation filed the required registration. Three weeks later, the foreign corporation moved to dismiss the petition to enforce and claimed the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over it. The trial court later summarily granted the petition to enforce. The appellate court found that (1) the foreign corporation could not cite its violation of the law, the lack of registration, as a jurisdictional escape hatch and, (2) in any event, the foreign corporation had significant contacts with Indiana such that it was not constitutionally impermissible to exercise personal jurisdiction over it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two women were accused of attempted theft from the electronics department of a store. Defendant argued that the trial court committed fundamental error by failing to instruct the jury regarding accomplice liability under Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-2-4 for the attempted theft charge. He also contended that the court committed fundamental error by admitting copies of certified court documents in the habitual offender proceedings. On appeal, the court found that the State of Indiana appeared not to have argued that defendant aided, induced, or caused the two women to commit the offense of attempted theft, but rather to have argued that he was a principal in the offense. Moreover, defendant could not establish substantial harm or substantial potential for harm due to the lack of accomplice liability instructions because the evidence was sufficient to convict him as a principal. Finally, although the certifications of defendant's prior offenses were copies rather than originals, in violation of Ind. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner sought pro se review of a grant of summary judgment by the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) in favor of defendants, the Indiana Department of Corrections (DOC) and a control unit, in the prisoner's action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief regarding his treatment in segregated confinement in the unit and alleging violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that it lacked jurisdiction over his claim for violation of the UDHR, that his claim for injunctive relief was moot based on his transfer from the unit, and that the DOC was not subject to declaratory judgment. On review, the court dismissed the prisoner's complaint. It was unclear whether the trial court conducted the review under Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 34-58-1-1 and 34-58-1-2, but the court found no impediment to its ability to apply those laws to the prisoner's current action. The DOC was required to adopt rules for the maintenance of order and discipline under Ind. Code &sect; 11-11-5-2, and the prisoner was segregated based upon his own unacceptable conduct. The court thus summarily found that the prisoner's complaint should be dismissed as frivolous and because it failed to state a claim upon which relief might be granted. Further, the court found that the complaint was due to be dismissed under Ind. Code &sect; 34-58-2-1 because the prisoner had filed at least three civil actions, which were dismissed, and the present claim did not reflect that the prisoner was in immediate danger of serious bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with possessing cocaine within one thousand feet of a family housing complex, a class B felony, Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-6. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) conducted a bench trial; denied his motion to dismiss, which challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 35-48-4-6; and convicted him of possession of cocaine, a class B felony. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trooper observed defendant outside of a hotel, loitering near a car belonging to an individual with an outstanding arrest warrant. The hotel was a family housing complex under Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-1-10.5. Defendant lied about his identity and tried to evade the trooper by walking into the lobby. Upon confirmation that the identity information was false, defendant was arrested and transported to a processing center where cocaine base was found in his pocket during an inventory search. The appellate court found that there was no abuse of discretion in admitting the cocaine because there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment or Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11. The trooper's approach and initial contact with defendant near the car did not amount to a seizure, as defendant was free to leave. The encounter evolved into a detention for investigatory purposes. Defendant's false identity information and other facts created a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The detention was reasonable given the totality of the circumstances. Denial of defendant's motion to dismiss was not error because the language of Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-6 was clear and unambiguous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with performance harmful to minors as a class D felony in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-49-3-3(a)(5) (2004), public indecency, and public nudity. The Hamilton Superior Court (Indiana) denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charge for performance harmful to minors. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The probable cause affidavit alleged that while in a public park, defendant exposed his penis and fondled it front of an undercover officer to attempt to get the officer to engage in oral sex. The court held that &sect; 35-49-3-3(a)(5), which forbade certain conduct in an area to which minors had access, did not require that a minor actually be present. Furthermore, unaccompanied minors were usually allowed in a public park. Thus, it was unnecessary for the State to name specific minor victims or to include the phrase &quot;unless each minor is accompanied by the minor's parent or guardian&quot; in the information. Next, as &sect; 35-49-3-3(a)(5) and Ind. Code &sect; 35-49-2-2(2) and (3) did not require minors' actual presence, there was no merit to the argument that there was no performance harmful to minors under &sect; 35-49-2-2. Finally, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-49-3-3 and 35-49-2-2 were not unconstitutionally vague. Individuals of ordinary intelligence would comprehend the statutes adequately enough to inform them of the proscribed conduct. Further, defendant's alleged conduct of exposing himself in a public park for the purpose of engaging in oral sex clearly fell within the conduct proscribed by the statutes.</SPAN></P>

She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's argument that the presumption created by Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-6-15(b) violated the United States Constitution. Under Indiana law, there was no fundamental right to drive a motor vehicle. By enjoying the privilege of driving on Indiana's roadways, defendant had consented to be subject to the legislation that governed their use. Furthermore, the presumption was a legislative creation, and it was within the legislature's prerogative to determine its applicability. Finally, defendant had not rebutted the presumption; reasonably, 45 minutes elapsed between the time defendant consumed her last alcoholic beverage at a restaurant and her undertaking the chemical breath test. Next, it was not error to admit under Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-6-5(b) the certificate of compliance for the breath test machine issued by the Indiana Department of Toxicology. The court had previously held that admission of such certifications did not violate the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Furthermore, the statement in the certification indicating that the machine was in good working order was not bolstering language that exceeded the scope of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected plaintiff's argument that under Ind. Code &sect; 36-1-3-8, the fee was greater than that reasonably related to the cost of exercising a regulatory power. The fact that the city did not have documentary evidence of specific calculations one year after the enactment of the ordinance did not itself establish that the cost did not exist or that the fee was not reasonably related to the regulatory purpose. Furthermore, the fact that before the ordinance was enacted, the city had no visible regulatory presence at plaintiff's office except for occasional fire inspections did not establish a lack of regulatory costs. The fact that the fees were deposited into the city's general fund and then distributed to municipal departments did not show that the fee was imposed with any other purpose than to defray the administrative costs of regulating business operations. The ordinance was not an unconstitutional attempt to license attorneys under Ind. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4 or an attempt under Ind. Code &sect; 36-1-3-8 to regulate conduct that was regulated by a state agency. It did not regulate who was licensed as an attorney or place any professional requirements on attorneys.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of carrying a handgun without a license as a Class C felony, resisting law enforcement as a Class A misdemeanor (by resisting), and resisting law enforcement as a Class A misdemeanor (by fleeing).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to stop him and therefore the handgun later found on his person should have been suppressed pursuant to the exclusionary rule. Even assuming the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to order defendant back into the car, by fleeing from and forcibly resisting the officer, defendant committed two new criminal offenses. These actions purged the taint from the unconstitutional investigatory stop, making the exclusionary rule inapplicable. The appellate court noted that defendant had no right to flee from and forcibly resist the officer. Even though the officer may not have had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant, the officer did have probable cause to believe that defendant violated the resisting law enforcement statute by fleeing after being ordered to stop and by forcibly resisting the officer. Because the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for those crimes, it followed that the handgun was seized incident to a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty but mentally ill to Class B felony criminal confinement. The Delaware Circuit Court (Indiana) imposed a 20-year sentence. It found that defendant was a sexually violent predator and required that he register as a sexual or violent offender. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reviewing the sentence under Ind. R. App. P. 7(B), the court stated that although defendant had Asperger's syndrome, there was conflicting evidence as to the extent it limited his overall functioning and no clear evidence of a direct nexus between it and the crime. Although defendant's attack on a classmate was egregious, the period of confinement was brief; thus, the offense could not be said to be in the worst class. Defendant's mental health, guilty plea, and lack of an official criminal history weighed in his favor. Thus, his sentence would be reduced to 15 years executed, plus two years suspended and served on probation. Next, including criminal confinement of a minor as a crime requiring defendant to register with the Sex and Violent Offender Registry under Ind. Code &sect; 11-8-8-5 did not violate substantive due process. Other courts had held that such inclusion bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. Finally, the trial court was to determine sexually violent predator status under the new procedures prescribed by Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-7.5(e), which addressed defendant's concerns regarding the conclusory nature of reports and experts' failure to testify.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's sentence and directed that it be revised to a term of 17 years, with two years suspended to supervised probation. It affirmed the requirement that defendant be placed on the Registry after his release from prison. It remanded for the trial court to reconsider defendant's sexually violent predator status after conducting a hearing on the matter that complied with the current version of &sect; 35-38-1-7.5(e).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was released from prison after serving his sentence for three counts of sexual misconduct with a minor. Pursuant to the then-existing version of the sex offender statute, he was required to register as a sex offender for the following 10 years. Defendant moved and failed to register. The appellate court noted a plea agreement was not used. Additionally, conducting a trial would have been fruitless. Thus, defendant did not waive the ex post facto issue. The overall legislative intent  in enacting the sex offender registry was civil and regulatory in nature. The registration did not restrain the offender's movement, and the information required to register was not burdensome. The consequence of violating the registration requirement was not retrospective because the amended version of the statute was in effect when defendant failed to register. However, the appellate court agreed that his criminal history's lack of gravity, dissimilarity, and proximity to the current offense did not warrant an enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed as to the conviction. The sentence imposed was inappropriate and it was remanded for the trial court to impose the presumptive sentence of eighteen months.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner challenged the judgment of the Spencer Circuit Court (Indiana), which granted partial summary judgment to appellees, a county plan commission and its board of commissioners (the county). The county filed a complaint for an injunction against the landowner, alleging that the landowner violated its building and zoning ordinances. The landowner counterclaimed alleging that the ordinances at issue were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner had purchased a truck stop, which consisted of a main building, a motel, and a convenience store. After the landowner commenced renovations without a permit, the county issued a stop-work order and filed suit seeking to prevent the landowner from operating a sexually oriented business on the property. The trial court subsequently issued a permanent injunction in favor of the county enjoining the landowner from operating such a business. The court held that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the landowner made more than $ 5,000 of renovations to the property without receiving a building permit and, therefore, it was not entitled to lawful nonconforming use status on the property. The court further held that the portions of the sexually oriented business ordinances at issue did not unconstitutionally burden protected speech and, therefore, the court rejected the landowner's argument that the challenged ordinances were unconstitutional. The court also determined that the permanent injunction was properly narrowed to enjoining the operation of a sexually oriented business only and did not prevent the operation of any compliant commercial business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court granting partial summary judgment in favor of the county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of operating a vehicle with an alcohol concentration equivalent of .15 or more, a misdemeanor, and was found to be a Habitual Substance Offender (HSO) under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-50-2-10. The Orange Circuit Court (Indiana) enhanced defendant's one-year sentence by seven years for the HSO determination, resulting in an eight-year sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first rejected defendant's argument that he was denied due process because the State had not disclosed evidence relating to the HSO allegation in a timely manner. The failure appeared to be inadvertent; thus, exclusion was not an appropriate remedy. Furthermore, the evidence produced by the State as part of discovery at least put defendant on notice of the prior convictions on which the State intended to rely. Next, the seven-year enhancement was not disproportionate under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, given the fact that the current offense was defendant's fifth OWI violation. Next, other than defendant's bare assertions, nothing substantiated his claim that his incarceration in the county jail instead of a state facility was cruel and unusual punishment under &sect; 16. The trial court did not err in not treating defendant's guilty plea to the HSO allegation as a significant mitigating circumstance. Defendant's guilty plea was a pragmatic decision that had not saved the State time or money. Finally, the eight-year sentence was not inappropriate under Ind. R. App. P. 7(B), given defendant's significant history of OWI convictions and an additional conviction involving alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant board of zoning appeals (BZA) sought review of the Hamilton Superior Court (Indiana) which reversed the determination by the BZA that a building maintained on property owned by appellee property owners constituted a violation of the Hamilton County, Ind., Zoning Ordinance art. 2, &sect;&nbsp;1, as it was not a principal building for residential purposes. The issue was whether the existence of a building used as a guesthouse was prohibited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners moved into a newly constructed home. They built a support building which included a small kitchen, a toilet and shower. The property owners informed the plan commission that they would not use the building for residential purposes, and that it would only be infrequently used as a guesthouse for occasional visitors. The plan commission alleged that the property owners violated Hamilton County, Ind. Zoning Ordinance art. 18C, &sect; 1(a). The property owners filed an application for a variance from the ordinance to &quot;allow&quot; their &quot;outbuilding&quot; to be used as a guest house. The application specified that the guest house would only be for occasional visitor use, not as a residence. Their request for a variance was denied. The property owners alleged that the ordinance did not forbid their use of an accessory building to temporarily house a visiting guest. The appellate court found that no application to vary the zoning ordinance was necessary as the accessory building was one to provide housing for less than 30 days and it was both incident to and related to their use of their main building. Thus, the guesthouse did not violate the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant gun manufacturers brought an interlocutory appeal from denial of their motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, judgment on the pleadings by the Lake Superior Court (Indiana) in an action brought by plaintiff city. The manufacturers argued, inter alia, that the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 7901-7903, barred the city's nuisance claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after the enactment of the PLCAA, the manufacturers moved to dismiss the city's nuisance complaint. The appellate court held that the case turned on the interpretation of the word &quot;applicable&quot; in the predicate exception, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7903(5)(A)(iii). Even assuming that the PLCAA required an underlying violation of a statute directly applicable to the sale or marketing of a firearm, the city alleged such violations in their complaint. The specific context did not create an ambiguous meaning of the predicate exception with regard to the particular dispute at issue. Indiana's public nuisance statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 32-30-6-6, was a legislative enactment, which the Indiana Supreme Court interpreted as applying to the city's claim. Thus, the city's claim was not an attempt to expand the common law and it was not an attempt to circumvent the legislative branch of government. Because the city's complaint and the Indiana Supreme Court's opinion indicated that the city alleged that the manufacturers violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, the city's action fell under the predicate exception and was not barred by the PLCAA.</SPAN></P>

The police discovered a digital camera which contained nude pictures of the mother, some of which included the children, and pictures of the parents engaged in sex acts. The appellate court, which assumed, without deciding, that evidence was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect;&nbsp;11, determined that the exclusionary rule did not apply to CHINS proceedings and thus, the trial court did not err in denying the parents' motion to suppress. The appellate court further concluded that the best evidence rule did not preclude the admission of evidence relating to pictures the officers had seen on the camera as police made a diligent search for the photos and memory card. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's findings of fact, as, inter alia, the children could have seen the parents engaging in sexual relations and there were pictures of the mother naked while a child touched her vaginal area.</SPAN></P>

The detective made some inquiries and confirmed defendant's identity. The detective then obtained a search warrant for the addresses. The search warrant was executed, marijuana was located, and defendant was arrested. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress and defendant was convicted based on the evidence found. After the search was conducted, but before defendant's convictions became final, the state supreme court announced in Litchfield a new constitutional rule that trash searches required Terry-like &quot;articulable individualized suspicion.&quot; The appellate court found that the new rule applied retroactively to defendant's case, that the source's tip lacked any indicia of reliability, and that the lack of reliability could not be excused by the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule recognized in Leon or in Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant daughter sought review of a decision of the Porter Superior Court (Indiana), which required her to file a bond, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 29-1-7-19, after she filed a complaint challenging the validity of her deceased mother's last will and testament. When the daughter failed to file the bond, the trial court had dismissed the complaint, entering judgment in favor of appellees, the estate, its personal representative, and others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no dispute that the daughter was required to file a bond. The contested issue was whether the $ 75,000 bond ordered by the trial court was unreasonable and an abuse of discretion. The appellate court reversed. The only evidence before the trial court when it set the bond was appellees' demonstrative exhibit that listed estimated costs to be incurred by the estate as a result of and during the will contest totaling $ 279,850. However, the estimated costs included, inter alia, costs for depositions, the production of medical records, and attorney fees. Those were litigation expenses that were not recoverable under &sect;&nbsp;29-1-7-19 and they should not have been considered when the bond was set. The bond was to be set at an amount to compensate for due prosecution of the will contest proceedings and the payment of all costs should the daughter not prevail in the will contest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for a cost determination consistent with the appellate court's opinion for purposes of setting the bond at an amount to compensate for due prosecution of the will contest proceedings and for payment of all costs if the daughter did not prevail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped after an officer observed defendant riding a moped without goggles and a helmet, as required for riders under 18 years of age, and swerving and crossing what the officer perceived to be the center point of the road. The issue on appeal was whether the officer violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect;&nbsp;11 against unreasonable searches and seizures when the officer asked defendant if he was in possession of drugs. The appellate court noted that the officer was entitled to detain defendant for a time sufficient to complete the purpose of the traffic stop. However, the appellate concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, the officer's inquiry that asked whether defendant had any drugs on him or with him was unreasonable under &sect;&nbsp;11. In the context of the afternoon traffic stop of defendant's moped for a traffic infraction, which presented no indications of drugs or other criminal activity, the officer's inquiry that asked defendant whether he possessed drugs was not related either to the purpose of the stop or to officer safety. While the officer's inquiry was minimal in terms of duration, it nevertheless extended the duration of the stop.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held a hearing to determine the validity of the signatures on both petitions and thereafter issued an order creating the conservancy district and dividing it into seven districts. The court held that the trial court erred as a matter of law by striking 10 signatures from the remonstrators' petition after they filed an untimely request to withdraw their signatures. However, the trial court properly struck four signatures from the remonstrators' petition because those individuals were not freeholders when the remonstrators filed their petition. As a result, the remonstrators' petition contained 50.9 percent of the freeholders' signatures, which was less than the 51 percent that was required to dismiss the petition, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 14-33-2-15. The court also agreed with the trial court's finding that the conservancy district was contiguous within the meaning of Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee tobacco company filed a complaint against appellant, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Indiana (OAG), in the Marion Circuit Court (Indiana), for injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment. The court found that the tobacco company was entitled to an injunction prohibiting the OAG from excluding the tobacco company from a directory, and to a declaration that it was a manufacturer of tobacco products. The OAG appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The OAG contended that the tobacco company's brand of cigarettes was not to be listed in the OAG's Directory of Cigarettes Approved for Stamping and Sale in Indiana because the tobacco company was not a tobacco product manufacturer under Ind. Code &sect; 24-3-3-10. In essence, if the tobacco company was not the manufacturer of cigarettes, the tobacco company could not sell its brand of cigarettes in Indiana. While the tobacco company did not physically produce its brand of cigarettes, it controlled the manufacturing process for its cigarettes. On appeal, the court found that the OAG's decision to equate &quot;manufacture&quot; with &quot;fabricate&quot; for purposes of considering the tobacco company's request for inclusion in the Directory was arbitrary and, therefore, unreasonable. Therefore, the trial court's determination that the tobacco company was the manufacturer of its brand of cigarettes was proper. Moreover, the injunction prohibiting the OAG from basing its decision to exclude the tobacco company from the Directory upon the OAG's determination that the tobacco company was not the manufacturer of its brand of cigarettes was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that it had previously held that the compulsory collection of DNA samples under the DNA Database, Ind.

It served a special need, assisting in future criminal investigations and for use in research and other administrative purposes, beyond the normal need for law enforcement and crime detection. Although the United States Supreme Court had recently used a general balancing test to determine whether a suspicionless search of a parolee was permissible, the special needs test was a more stringent analysis. Defendant presented no cogent reasoning to explain why the court, having upheld the statutes under the special needs analysis, should find the statutes unconstitutional under the less stringent general balancing test. Thus, his argument was waived under Ind. R. App. P. 46(A)(8)(a). Moreover, defendant had presented no argument as to why the court's balancing of the salient interests in the previous case was either in error or otherwise inapplicable; thus, that error was waived too. Next, the court admonished defense counsel, whose brief contained uncited material in violation of Rule 46(A)(8)(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decedent brought an action against defendant manufacturer based on exposure to asbestos fibers. Later, plaintiff executor was substituted for the decedent. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) denied defendant's motion for summary judgment. It held that the 10-year statute of repose of Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1 did not apply to plaintiff's cause of action. Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Through 1977, defendant manufactured an asphalt sealant that contained asbestos fibers. At some point from around 1980 to 1982, the decedent used a sealant made by defendant. He first developed symptoms consistent with asbestos exposure in June 2004. The next month, he was diagnosed with mesothelioma resulting from asbestos exposure. He filed his complaint in 2005. The court noted that the Indiana Supreme Court had held that Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-2 did not apply to non-miner defendants. Accordingly, as defendant was not a miner, plaintiff's action was barred by Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1. Although the supreme court had held that &sect; 34-20-3-1 could be unconstitutional if a plaintiff could have been diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease during the 10-year repose period, it was undisputed that the decedent had not developed symptoms until about 22 years after his last possible exposure to asbestos. Finally, the court would not reach the issue of whether Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-2 violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. Plaintiff lacked a cognizable harm from which to challenge any constitutional defect, and defendant as a non-miner lacked standing to challenge the statute.</SPAN></P>

The Marion Superior Court denied defendant's motion for summary judgment. It held that the 10-year statute of repose of Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1 did not apply to the action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and its predecessor in interest distributed asbestos fibers on behalf of a mining company that later went bankrupt. Sometime between 1976 and 1982, the decedent was exposed to raw asbestos fibers. In 2004, he was diagnosed with mesothelioma resulting from asbestos exposure. The court stated that because defendant was not a miner, Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-2 did not apply to it; therefore, the statute of repose of Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1 applied. It rejected plaintiff's argument that Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 34-20-2-4 (2004), providing for jurisdiction over a principal distributor when a court could not hold jurisdiction over a manufacturer, required treating defendant as if it were a miner. Section 34-20-2-4 applied only to Ind. Code ch. 34-20-2. Furthermore, the Indiana Supreme Court had read Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-2 to apply only to actual miners of asbestos. Thus, plaintiff's suit was barred by the statute of repose. As for the argument that the supreme court's analysis of Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-2 violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, plaintiff lacked a cognizable harm from which to challenge any constitutional defect, and defendant, as a non-miner, lacked standing to challenge the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer did not record his deed to the parcel. After the taxpayer filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, the county auditor sent notice of a tax sale and redemption rights to the former owner, but not to the taxpayer. No one bought the parcel; the county then received a tax certificate for the parcel. After the redemption period expired, it successfully petitioned the trial court for the issuance of a tax deed for the parcel; it then sold the parcel to a third party. Later, the bankruptcy court dismissed the taxpayer's bankruptcy case. The taxpayer argued that the county's petition for a tax deed was void because it was filed while the bankruptcy was pending, which violated the automatic stay imposed by 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 362. The appellate court agreed. Petitioning for the issuance of a tax deed was an affirmative act to obtain possession of property of the estate, in violation of &sect; 362(a)(3). That the county was ignorant of the bankruptcy filing was irrelevant when considering whether it violated the stay, and the dismissal of the bankruptcy case did not retroactively lift the stay. As the tax deed was void, the sale to the third party was also void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the denial of the taxpayer's motion to set aside the issuance of the tax deed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fireworks wholesalers filed an action against defendant Indiana State Fire Marshall in which plaintiffs challenged a requirement that wholesalers with multiple sales locations obtain separate certificates of compliance for each location in which they operated. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) denied defendant's motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Ind. Code &sect; 22-11-14-5, wholesalers of restricted fireworks had to pay a $1,000 annual fee to operate in Indiana. Defendant interpreted this provision to mean that wholesalers had to pay the fee for each wholesale location that they operated. Defendant argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies before filing the complaint. Defendant argued that there was no opportunity for administrative review. The court stated that the Indiana Supreme Court had categorically held that the question of whether &sect; 22-11-14-5 required fireworks wholesalers to obtain separate certificates of compliance for each of their locations was a question of fact that could be resolved through the administrative process. The supreme court had rejected the assertion that review would be futile because there was no formal mechanism in place for the review of defendant's policies of general applicability. The mere fact that an administrative agency might refuse to provide the relief requested did not amount to futility. Accordingly, plaintiffs were required to pursue administrative review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's ruling with instructions that the complaint be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dental office treated an employee of defendant hospital for work-related injuries. A single member of the Indiana Worker's Compensation Board awarded plaintiff prejudgment interest after plaintiff was belatedly paid the amount owed on its claim. Defendant appealed to the full Board, which reversed the single member's decision and denied plaintiff prejudgment interest. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that a contract was created when it was requested by defendant's insurer to provide medical care to the employee. Therefore, it argued, the case should be treated as any other civil contract action addressing prejudgment interest. The court stated that a proceeding for worker's compensation was purely statutory in origin and procedure. Therefore, the rights and obligations of the parties had to be determined by reference to the Worker's Compensation Act. The legislature had amended the Act numerous times, but had never seen fit to add a provision for prejudgment interest for balances owed to health care providers for services rendered to employees in worker's compensation cases. Plaintiff was seeking prejudgment interest pursuant to a worker's compensation claim, and the court had no authority to read into a statute a provision the legislature had purposely omitted. As the court had determined that plaintiff was not entitled to prejudgment interest in that there was no provision for such within the Act, it would not address plaintiff's argument under the Indiana Constitution's Equal Privileges Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A worker who had been exposed to asbestos-containing insulation products sought worker's compensation benefits under the Occupational Diseases Act (ODA) from appellee employer. After the worker died, appellant estate was substituted as plaintiff. The full Worker's Compensation Board of Indiana dismissed the claim under Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-7-36(b). The estate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board held that because the worker had recovered against third parties, the employer had no further liability to compensate him for his occupational disease. The court rejected the estate's argument that dismissal of the application was premature. The third-party lawsuit was final, the verdict defendant had paid its portion of the judgment in full, and the estate had received in excess of $4 million, well in excess of the potential amount recoverable under the ODA. The dismissal would not impair the estate's pursuit of claims against bankrupt defendants. Next, &sect; 22-3-7-36(b) as applied to the estate did not violate Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, by denying the estate a complete remedy. The sum of the estate's recovery exceeded the total damages found by the jury. Furthermore, the humanitarian purpose of the ODA was to provide workers with an expeditious and adequate remedy, not a complete remedy. Finally, the statute as applied here did not violate Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, the Open Courts Clause. The estate had not been denied access to the courts, but had chosen to pursue third parties, forgoing the statutory remedy against the employer.</SPAN></P>

The Elkhart Superior Court (Indiana) sentenced defendant to jail time, with most suspended to probation, suspended defendant's driver's license for 90 days, and required defendant to pay fines and make a written apology to the arresting officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence obtained during a warrantless entry of defendant's home in violation of the Fourth Amendment and deprived defendant of the opportunity to present his defense when it, inter alia, refused to exclude the evidence or give instructions on reasonable resistance. The appellate court agreed, finding that exigent circumstances sufficient to overcome the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment did not exist. The officer did not order defendant to stop and was not in &quot;hot pursuit&quot; at the time defendant entered his garage. The officer could have obtained a telephonic warrant pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-33-5-8(a)(2), prior to entry into defendant's home. The appellate court went on to conclude that, even without the improperly obtained evidence, there was sufficient evidence to permit a factfinder to conclude defendant committed the offense of driving while intoxicated and thus, retrial on that charge would be permitted. However, because there was not sufficient evidence to establish that defendant forcibly resisted the officer by strong, violent, or powerful means, defendant could not be retried on the resisting charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Remonstrators, a town and a limited liability company, brought an action against defendants, a county redevelopment commission and a county board of commissioners, after defendants created an economic development area (EDA). The Boone Superior Court (Indiana) upheld the creation of the EDA. Remonstrators appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that remonstrators were &quot;aggrieved&quot; under Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-14-18(a). Whenever an action caused someone to lose control over the development of his own property, he was sufficiently aggrieved to challenge that action. Thus, any person who owned property in a proposed EDA was &quot;aggrieved&quot; for purposes of &sect; 36-7-14-18. Next, 1425 acres of the area in question had previously been annexed by the town. Under case law, the authority that first undertook to exercise jurisdiction acquired exclusive jurisdiction. Here, the town had exercised jurisdiction when it adopted the annexation ordinance. Thus, the county was prohibited from establishing an EDA over those 1425 acres. With regard to the additional 2500 acres at issue, the procedure followed in creating the EDA, being legislative in nature, did not violate remonstrators' federal due process rights or Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-14-17. Finally, in asking the court to find that the county had established the EDA as a power grab rather than in an effort to promote the best interests of the county, remonstrators were simply requesting that the court judge the credibility of witnesses and reweigh the evidence, which it would not do.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's conclusion that remonstrators were not aggrieved. It also reversed the trial court's approval of the EDA as to 1425 acres in an annexation ordinance. It affirmed the trial court's approval of the EDA area as to an additional 2500 acres.</SPAN></P>

The Indiana Supreme Court held that the fee violated the Indiana Constitution, but did not rule on the parents' federal due process claim. On remand to the Vanderburgh Superior Court (Indiana), the parents filed a motion for attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The trial court denied the motion. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first stated that a plaintiff could be considered to be a prevailing party even when the merits of a federal constitutional claim had not been addressed, as long as the plaintiff's claims arose out of a common nucleus of operative fact and the federal claim was substantial.

The supreme court had explicitly held that the fee violated Ind. Const. art. 8, &sect; 1. Thus, the parents had succeeded on a significant issue in the litigation that achieved some of the benefit they sought. The state and federal claims arose out of the same facts, the practice of charging an activity fee. Furthermore, the federal claim was substantial. It had been accepted by the trial court in an initial summary judgment ruling and by at least one judge on the present court. Next, it was not until the second set of parents were added to the suit that a federal claim was brought.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the denial of his petition for modification of sentence by the Monroe Circuit Court (Indiana). Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court should have conducted a hearing and the trial court had authority to modify his sentence when the request was submitted more than one year after defendant began serving his sentence and the request for modification was not approved by the prosecuting attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of child molesting, received a 55-year executed sentence. Defendant's motion to modify his sentence by reducing the term of years was denied. Defendant offered no support for his contention that Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-17(b) ran afoul of the Indiana Constitution because it permitted a court to deny a petition for modification without first conducting a hearing. The appellate court held there was nothing vindictive about requiring defendant to serve his entire sentence. The appellate court declined his invitation to create a requirement that a hearing must be held before a trial court could rule upon a request for sentence modification under &sect; 35-38-1-17(b) where a prosecutor refused to approve the request. There was nothing sinister or vindictive about the Department of Correction's allocation of resources. As defendant submitted his request for modification long after the statutory 365-day period had lapsed, and there was no evidence that the prosecutor approved his petition for modification, the trial court had no authority to grant his request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the noise generated by her outbursts was not unreasonable under the circumstances, and therefore the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of disorderly conduct. The sheer volume of defendant's outbursts disrupted the officers' investigation and attracted unwanted attention. The officers repeatedly asked defendant to lower her voice and to leave the scene of their investigation. Defendant defiantly ignored their requests and shouted even louder. The instant court found that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for disorderly conduct because she produced decibels of sound that were too loud for the circumstances. Defendant's speech was ultimately ambiguous as to whether she was commenting on her own conduct or that of the officers. Accordingly, defendant's expression was not political. The State could have rationally concluded that where defendant obstructed and interfered with the officers' attempts to function as law enforcement officers, her conduct constituted an abuse of the right to speak and fell within the State's police power. Thus, defendant's arrest for disorderly conduct did not violate Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

Appellant rejected the administrator's qualified settlement offer (QSO). A jury returned a verdict in favor of the administrator. The administrator moved for attorney's fees, costs, and expenses pursuant to the QSO statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 34-50-1-6.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court determined that the trial court properly awarded the administrator $ 1,000 in attorney's fees, costs, and expenses. Regarding appellant's argument that the QSO statute chilled tort litigants' rights to access Indiana courts in violation of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12, the court determined that the QSO statute did not violate &sect; 12 because the possibility of paying up to $ 1,000 in attorney's fees after rejecting a more favorable offer than what was awarded at trial was not an impediment to a party's access to courts. The QSO statute also did not violate Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23 based upon the argument that tort litigants were treated differently from other civil litigants, because the preferential treatment, i.e. receipt of attorney's fees, was equally available to any offeror when a QSO was rejected and the offeree received a less favorable final judgment. The QSO statute permitted the award of fees to an attorney hired by the administrator's insurance company because the administrator incurred an obligation to pay her attorney's fees even if her insurance company ultimately paid them on her behalf, and payment to a nonparty was permitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mortgagee brought suit against defendants, a county treasurer and a county auditor, in which plaintiff argued that defendants were negligent in not notifying it of tax sale surplus funds before disbursing them and that plaintiff's due process rights had been violated. The Howard Circuit Court (Indiana) granted defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-24-7(b) was unconstitutional because it did not designate mortgagees as claimants. The court stated that as it had held in a related case, plaintiff had received the notices provided for in Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 6-1.1-25-4.5 and 6-1.1-25-4.6, but had taken no action to protect its interest in the property after it received the notices. Plaintiff could have learned additional information about the property by contacting the county, but had failed to do so. The tax sale statutes were not designed to protect those who received actual notice of a tax sale, but then did nothing else to protect their interest in the property. Thus, the court rejected the argument that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-24-7(b) was unconstitutional. Furthermore, defendants had followed the relevant statutory procedures in distributing the surplus funds. Thus, they were not negligent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a quiet title action filed by the predecessor of appellee limited liability company (LLC), appellant mortgagee filed a counterclaim and third-party complaint against appellees, a county auditor and a treasurer. The Delaware Circuit Court (Indiana) granted summary judgment to the LLC with regard to possession of a mobile home. It granted summary judgment to the auditor and the treasurer with regard to tax sale proceeds. The mortgagee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagee lent the mortgagors funds to purchase a mobile home and a lot. The lot was later sold to the LLC's predecessor at a tax sale. The sale produced a surplus, of which the mortgagee was not notified. The surplus was paid to the mortgagors. The court first held that the mobile home was personal property under Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-1-11(a)(4). Furthermore, because the mobile home could be removed from the real estate without material damage to the real estate, it was not a &quot;building or fixture situated on the land&quot; under Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-1-15. Thus, it had not passed to the LLC through the tax deed, and the mortgagee was entitled to possession of the mobile home through its recorded lien on the certificate of title. Next, the court rejected the mortgagee's argument that it had been denied due process because it had not been given notice of the surplus. The mortgagee had been given the notices required by Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 6-1.1-25-4.5 and 6-1.1-25-4.6 and had done nothing to protect its interest in the land after receiving the notices. As the auditor and the treasurer had followed the required statutory procedures in distributing the surplus, they were not negligent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the owner of an apartment complex, brought an action for injunctive relief against defendant conservancy district. Defendant filed an answer and counterclaim for unpaid sewer fees and attorney's fees. The Hendricks Circuit Court (Indiana) entered summary judgment in favor of defendant. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time defendant adopted a resolution establishing higher rates for its sewer customers, plaintiff had been classified as a commercial customer. It continued to be billed as such until six months later, when it began to be billed as a residential customer. Defendant first argued that plaintiff had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The court stated that a user who objected to ratemaking normally had to follow the procedures set out in Ind. Code &sect; 36-9-23-26.1. The statute, however, did not provide a means to challenge a classification that occurred well after a rate ordinance had been adopted. Thus, judicial review was not precluded here. Next, the classification of plaintiff as a residential user was not arbitrary or capricious. The resolution defined a residential user as including &quot;all dwelling units.&quot; This term could only pertain to an apartment building. Furthermore, defendant had classified all apartment buildings as residential users. Finally, Ind. Code &sect; 36-9-23-31 was clear and unambiguous. It did not provide for compounding penalties, but for a single penalty of 10 percent. As such, defendant was not authorized to compound the statutory penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment on the issue of the amount of fees and the total penalty plaintiff owed to defendant.

It affirmed the remainder of the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential informant told an officer that he bought cocaine from defendant. Police never made a controlled buy from defendant. An officer conducted surveillance of defendant's residence but did not note any evidence consistent with drug dealing. Eight months after receiving the tip, the officer collected trash that had been set out for delivery outside defendant's home. The trash contained marijuana seeds and stems and about 25 plastic bags with cocaine residue. The officer then obtained a search warrant for the home, which contained drugs and over $3,000 in cash. The court stated that the tip had not been corroborated and was stale, and there was no previous history of tips from the informant. Under these circumstances, any weight given to the tip as a declaration against penal interest was insufficient to provide the reasonable suspicion required for the &quot;trash pull.&quot; The good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, however, applied. There was no evidence that the officer had acted with intentional, reckless, or even negligent disregard of defendant's rights under the United States or Indiana constitutions when he searched the garbage, then obtained a search warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient filed a medical malpractice action against defendant doctor.

The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient, a quadriplegic, contended that summary judgment was inappropriate because Indiana's medical malpractice &quot;occurrence-based&quot; statute was unconstitutional as applied to the patient. The appellate court concluded that it was unconstitutional to apply the &quot;occurrence-based&quot; nature of Indiana's medical malpractice statute of limitations to the patient. It was not until another doctor informed the patient of the doctor's possible malpractice that the patient had sufficient knowledge to discover the malpractice. A previous diagnosis which included a complicated postsurgical list of problem was not sufficient to put the patient on notice that the patient had been the victim of medical malpractice. The appellate court further noted that the patient did not have a meaningful opportunity to bring his action between the discovery date and the running of the statute of limitations because of the extensive corrective procedures required and the fact that the patient was on oxygen and unable to be transported by car for a period of time following the procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the case was remanded to proceed with the patient's action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 4-30-14-4 (2002), which made disclosure of confidential information relating to the lottery a class A felony. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) denied defendant's motion to dismiss. Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal in which he argued that the penalty violated the proportionality clause, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who worked for the lottery, was accused of disclosing confidential information to two lottery customers, who subsequently brought a winning ticket. At the time of the alleged acts, Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-50-2-4 (2004) provided that the penalty for a Class A felony was a presumptive sentence of 30 years, with a minimum of 20 years and a maximum of 50 years. The court held that Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 4-30-14-4 was not disproportionate. The crime was not merely an economic one, but involved the disclosure of confidential information, most likely by an employee of the lottery commission, which was statutorily charged with maintaining the integrity and dignity of the lottery and of the State. It had the potential to affect many citizens of Indiana. The state lottery served an important revenue-generating function that, in turn, benefitted the public welfare. Finally, because of the difficulty in detecting the crime of disclosing confidential information relating to the lottery, the crime justified a stricter penalty for the sake of deterrence. Moreover, a court was not allowed to set aside a legislative determination as to an appropriate penalty merely because it seemed too severe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the State of Indiana and the City of Union City, brought a forfeiture action against defendant mother under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 34-24-1-4(a) (2003). Methamphetamine had been found in defendant's truck after her son was arrested in October 2003 for driving it on a suspended license. The Randolph Superior Court (Indiana) ordered the forfeiture of the truck. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first rejected defendant's argument the search of the truck was illegal. It was a search incident to a lawful custodial arrest and did not violate the Fourth Amendment. As for Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, the interior search of the truck was reasonable under the circumstances. Before searching the truck, an officer had found a hollowed-out pen that contained a powdery looking residue; the degree of intrusion upon defendant was minimal, as she was not present and the search took place in the evening; and the needs of law enforcement were a factor, as there was a possible concern with preserving any potential evidence relating to the discovery of the pen and the crime of possession of paraphernalia. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to support the forfeiture order. The son had a reputation for being involved with drugs; the son had been arrested three times for drug offenses in 2003 before his October 2003 arrest; the son lived with or on the same lot as defendant at the time of his arrests: defendant had posted bond for him once and said that she &quot;might have known&quot; of the other arrests; and the son was driving the car with defendant's permission in October 2003.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In essence, the complaint asserted that alleged actions by certain of the department's officials, including the use of physical force, were in retaliation for the inmate's prolific amount of litigation. The inmate argued that the trial court erred in dismissing his complaint pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 34-58-2-1 because that code section was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed. Ind. Code &sect; 34-58-2-1 did not infringe upon a fundamental right to seek redress in court, but instead placed conditions on a prisoner's ability to file a claim. Ind. Code &sect; 34-58-2-1 did not unreasonably deny offenders the right of access to the courts, but offered a balance between an offender's right to bring a civil action and the heavy burden that those claims placed on the judicial system. The State had an interest in preserving valuable judicial and administrative resources. The inmate had filed more than 100 complaints in his 30-plus years of incarceration. Nothing in the record substantiated the inmate's claim that he was in immediate danger of serious bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) mailed a notice of its determination that defendant was a habitual traffic violator, under Ind.

Defendant admitted that he knew his license was suspended, but argued that he did not know it was suspended under Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-10-5 for his status as a habitual traffic violator (HTV). He stated that he never received the notice from the BMV, and introduced evidence that when the BMV mailed the notice, he was living at a different location. Additionally, he never informed the BMV that his address had changed as required by Ind. Code &sect; 9-24-13-4. On appeal, the court found that the OWHTV statute required that defendant have actual knowledge that his license was suspended because he was determined to be a HTV. The trial court also did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendant rebutted the presumption under Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-10-16(b)(1) that he had knowledge of his HTV status, notwithstanding the fact that he failed to comply with the requirement that he notify the BMV of a change in address.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Undercover police officers visited the club and stated that they were interested in joining it. After completing a membership application and being given membership cards, the officers were given a tour of the club. During the tour, the officers saw various adults performing sex acts. Plaintiffs then brought the present action. Defendants argued that the club was a private club and therefore not subject to the city's nuisance ordinance. The court held that there was an issue of material fact as to whether the club was private. The club had no signage on its building or grounds to indicate to the public the nature of the activities that took place inside; it did not advertise in local newspapers or other local media; and it did not in any manner direct the general public to the club or invite the public inside. Its membership agreement was explicit in stating that the general public could not use the premises. There was no evidence that persons were able to enter the club without obtaining membership or that the club accepted every applicant. It was not necessary for a club to be owned by members who were directly involved in its operation for it to be private as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for battery resulting in bodily injury by the Hamilton Superior Court (Indiana). Specifically, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction as the trial court did not believe the victim's account of events, and the trial court's domestic violence determination constituted judicial factfinding in violation of Blakely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim told defendant, her husband of 23 years, that she wanted a divorce. A confrontation ensued at their home. During the argument, The victim stated that defendant forcibly poked her with his finger, climbed on top of her, placed his knee against her chest, and covered her mouth with his hand. The victim freed herself and fled. She suffered bruising on her body and a scratch on her face. While the trial court opined that the confrontation might have been mutual, it clearly stated that the victim's guilt was not for it to determine. The appellate court held the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of class A misdemeanor battery. Even though defendant was not convicted of domestic battery, the trial court still made a domestic violence determination because Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-7.7 required it to do so if defendant committed a crime of domestic violence based upon the evidence introduced at trial. As defendant testified that the victim was his wife, for Blakely purposes, that testimony constituted an admission. Thus, the domestic violence determination did not implicate Blakely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bail bondsman brought an action against appellees, a county and a court clerk, in which appellant challenged the constitutionality of Indiana's bail scheme. Appellee county bar association was allowed to intervene as a defendant. The Lake Superior Court (Indiana) entered summary judgment in favor of the county and the clerk on the basis of res judicata. Appellant challenged the trial court's decision. Appellees sought sanctions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had brought a previous action challenging the constitutionality of the bail scheme in 1999. He argued that his claim involving Ind. Code &sect; 35-33-8.5-4 had not been litigated in the prior action. The court stated that it was clear that appellant had alleged at some point in the former proceedings that appellees were not enforcing the statute and that he had litigated that matter in the context of his constitutional claims. The fact that the matter was not actually determined by the Indiana Supreme Court was inconsequential for res judicata purposes. Next, appellant argued that res judicata was inapplicable because the bar association had not been an intervenor in the prior case. The trial court, however, had entered summary judgment only as to the county and the clerk, both of whom were parties in the previous case. Thus, res judicata applied to them. Next, appellant had a well documented history of piecemeal attacks on Indiana's bail scheme. Viewed in that context, the appeal here could be characterized as harassing and vexatious under Ind. R. App. P. 66(E). Thus, the court would remand the case for a calculation of damages under Rule 66(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the entry of summary judgment. It remanded the case for a calculation of damages to which appellees might be entitled under Ind. R. App. P. 66(E).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of child molesting as a Class B felony, child molesting as a Class A felony, child molesting as a Class C felony, and incest. The trial court merged the incest count with the Class C molestation count and imposed concurrent sentences, and imposed twenty separate special probation conditions for adult sex offenders. The Shelby Circuit Court (Indiana) denied defendant's motion for a new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting statements made during a polygraph examination. The appellate court disagreed, holding that statements made during a polygraph test were not excludable per se as evidence. The appellate court also concluded that defendant voluntarily made the subject statements, noting that defendant was not in custody, signed a polygraph waiver, and was not coerced into making the statements. Defendant also asserted that the trial court improperly prohibited the introduction of the victim's prior sexual history. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the evidence defendant sought to introduce related to an incident that occurred after the alleged sexual abuse by defendant and thus occurred after the victim's medical examination in which a doctor found evidence consistent with sexual assault. The appellate court also found that the special probation conditions prohibiting defendant from possessing or viewing pornographic or sexually explicit materials, requiring defendant to report dating activity, and requiring defendant to report incidental contacts with persons under 18 were not stated with sufficient specificity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded for the trial court to clarify certain conditions of probation with greater specificity, specifically the conditions prohibiting defendant from possession or viewing pornographic or sexually explicit materials, requiring defendant to report dating activity, and requiring defendant to report incidental contacts with persons under the age of 18. The judgment of the trial court was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Randolph Circuit Court (Indiana) granted defendant's motion to suppress where defendant was charged with the murder of his wife, police executed a search warrant in conducting their investigation of that murder, and the trial court granted the State's belated motion to file an interlocutory appeal. The State appealed the granting of the motion to suppress; defendant cross-appealed the issuance of the warrant and the belated motion rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman placed a call to 911 and informed the operator that the victim, who appeared to be deceased, was in the residence. Defendant, the victim's husband, said that the victim had recently left the residence and that defendant soon found her floating face down in a nearby pond. Defendant then told the woman that he carried the victim into the residence and placed her on a couch. The woman told the 911 operator that the victim appeared to have bruises. A sheriff's investigator filed a probable cause affidavit in support of a search warrant. Based on the affidavit, a search warrant was issued that described places to be searched and included a search for &quot;any and all trace evidence&quot; in those locations. Thereafter, defendant was charged with the victim's murder. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress upon concluding that the search warrant was not sufficiently particular. It then granted the State's belated motion to file an interlocutory appeal. On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court had good cause for granting the belated appeal, the warrant was supported by probable cause, and that the warrant was as particular as the circumstances would allow.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's ruling granting the motion to suppress was reversed, the issuance of the search warrant was affirmed, and the ruling granting the State's belated motion to file an interlocutory appeal was affirmed. Too, the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate sued defendant Indiana Department of Correction (IDOC), alleging the conditions in the punitive disciplinary segregation unit in which he was confined violated his rights under the Indiana Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was placed in the disciplinary segregation unit due to numerous disciplinary violations, 25 of which he admitted committing. He alleged the conditions of his confinement in the unit violated his rights under Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 11 and 23, because he was forced to remain in his cell 23 hours per day, was not allowed to possess hardback books or compact disc players, and was denied access to someone trained in the law. The appellate court noted that to the extent the inmate sought reassignment to the general population, it was without jurisdiction to consider that matter. The trial court was entitled to disbelieve his unsubstantiated claim that he was the victim of abusive treatment at the hands of IDOC personnel. He was not entitled to a preliminary injunction because he had an adequate legal remedy -- filing the instant lawsuit. IDOC's policies obviously did not impede his legal endeavors, as he had filed at least 14 appeals in less than two years. Placing him in the segregation unit did not violate Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 11 and 23, because his confinement was not arbitrary, but was attributable to his numerous disciplinary violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a registered sex offender, filed an action against defendant town in which he challenged the constitutionality of an ordinance that prevented sexual offenders from using town parks. The Hendricks Superior Court (Indiana) granted the town's motion to reconsider its order allowing plaintiff to proceed anonymously. It certified its order for interlocutory appeal, of which the present court accepted jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first stated that Ind. Admin. R. 9(A), governing court records, and the corresponding commentary suggested a balancing approach instead of a strict interpretation of Ind. R. Trial P. 10 and 17, governing captions and the prosecution of a suit by a real party in interest. The court concluded that plaintiff's need for anonymity outweighed the presumption of openness in judicial proceedings. Plaintiff was challenging government action, a situation in which a plaintiff's interest in proceeding anonymously was considered particularly strong. Both plaintiff and his son had been subjected to threats and acts of violence. Defendant would not suffer prejudice because plaintiff had disclosed his real name to its counsel. Plaintiff's use of a fictitious name would not interfere with the public's right or ability to follow the proceedings. Finally, although plaintiff had previously written a letter to defendant's chief of police threatening legal action, nothing in this letter connected plaintiff to the present case except for what defendant's counsel knew. Thus, plaintiff had not waived his right to claim a need for anonymity.</SPAN></P>

The stepfather observed that defendant's underwear was in its normal place, but that defendant's jeans were pulled down around his knees. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had the requisite intent because both defendant and the victim were 10 years old when the act took place. The appellate court concluded that the record contained insufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant was older than the victim, a requirement of Ind. Code &sect;&nbsp;35-42-4-3(b). The appellate court declined to find that testimony by the victim or the victim's stepfather that defendant was 11 years old established that defendant was older than the victim, particularly in light of the trial court's references to defendant as a 10 year old. The appellate court further concluded that the fact that the State alleged that the victim had the mental capacity of a five to six-year-old was irrelevant for purposes of the child molestation statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery in 1992. In 2005, he received a gubernatorial pardon. Defendant then filed a motion to expunge the criminal records related to his conviction. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) denied his request. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that it had previously held that in carrying out the executive mandate of a pardon, a trial court was required to clear a defendant's name by expunging the record of his conviction. Therefore, as the State conceded, the trial court had erred in not expunging the record of conviction. Defendant also sought, however, to have his arrest records expunged. Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-5-1 applied to expunging arrest records either when no criminal charges had ever been filed or when the charges had been dropped. Accordingly, as defendant had been convicted, the statute did not apply. No Indiana statute set out the procedure for expunging records after a gubernatorial pardon. The majority of states, however, held that a pardon did not entitle a defendant to expunction of all criminal records related to the conviction. Moreover, it had also been held that where a pardon was conditional, there could not be expunction of all criminal records related thereto. Here, the pardon showed no conditions per se, but there was nothing indicating that it was intended to be unconditional. Accordingly, defendant was not entitled to have his arrest records expunged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of defendant's request to have his arrest records expunged. It reversed the denial of defendant's request to have his record of conviction expunged. It remanded the case to the trial court with directions to it to expunge defendant's record of conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a trial in the Porter Superior Court (Indiana), defendants, who were opposed to hunting, were convicted of violating Ind. Code &sect; 14-22-37-2(b) (1998), part of the Hunter Harassment Act. Defendants appealed. They argued that the Act violated the First Amendment and that the evidence was insufficient to support their conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that the Act was content neutral. The Act was not a regulation of speech, but a regulation of the place and the manner where some speech could occur. Speech was limited only in that it could not interfere with a lawful hunt on lands designated for bow hunting. The Act had not been adopted because of disagreement with the content of speech but to maintain safe hunts and to help control overpopulation of deer. The State's interests in protecting hunters' and protestors' safety and in facilitating the taking of game for ecological reasons were unrelated to the content of protestors' speech. The Act was narrowly tailored to prevent speech only in hunting areas that was intended to disturb game and impede the lawful taking of such game. Next, the Act was not overbroad; it merely regulated the time, place, and manner in which communications could occur. Any purported vagueness was ameliorated by its scienter requirement. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. From defendants' statements at public meetings and to others, there was overwhelming circumstantial evidence that they had the intent to scare deer away on the date in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that each of the three aggravators used to enhance her sentence violated Blakely. The appellate court first concluded that the use of defendant's prior convictions did not violate Blakely. The use of the victim's age, while obviously clear to the trial court and the parties, was erroneous, however, because it was not proven and defendant did not admit that the child, who was seven weeks old, was less than 12 years of age. The fact that defendant, the victim's mother, was in a position of trust was proven though defendant's admission that the presentence investigation report was accurate, as it included language that defendant stated she fell asleep with her son, thereby proving she was the child's mother. The appellate court also found no error in the trial court's use of a prior traffic stop to disprove defendant's rehabilitation as a mitigating factor. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by using defendant's criminal history as an aggravating factor because the prior misdemeanor convictions were not sufficiently weighty or similar to the current offense to justify enhancing defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with one count of felony child solicitation and two counts of felony dissemination of material harmful to minors. Defendant pleaded guilty to the child solicitation count in exchange for dismissal of the other counts, with a cap of two years on the executed portion of his sentence. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) imposed a sentence of four years, with two executed and two suspended to probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the sentence imposed was inappropriate in light of the nature of the offense and defendant's character. The appellate court disagreed with defendant's suggestion that the particulars of his offense were unremarkable and did not go beyond the inherent nature of the crime charged. At the guilty plea hearing, defendant admitted to sending the intended victim photos of himself in partial and complete undress. Defendant also admitted his intention to bring an alcoholic beverage to his planned rendezvous with a person he believed to be a 14-year-old girl. The appellate court concluded that those facts went beyond the mere solicitation of a purported child by using a computer network. Moreover, those facts reflected unfavorably on defendant's character and significantly diminished the luster of his lack of prior convictions, employment history, military service, and cooperation with the police. In addition, defendant provided no independent evidence to support his claim of severe depression or to establish that his depression affected his ability to differentiate between right and wrong.</SPAN></P>

The company contended that the statute of limitations was tolled under Ind. Code &sect; 34-11-4-1, due to the buyer's absence from the state. It also asserted that Ind. R. Trial P. 4.10, the procedural provision for providing service through the Indiana Secretary of State, was unconstitutional as applied because it allowed the buyer to receive constructive, rather than actual notice, of the suit. It The court noted that R. 4.10 was presumed to be constitutional. The company could not show that R. 4.10 was unconstitutional as applied because the buyer had not been served in the suit. Ind. Code &sect; 34-11-4-1 did not apply because under Ind. R. Trial P. 4.4(B), the Secretary was deemed to be the buyer's agent for service of process. The suit was time-barred because the company had not attempted to serve either the buyer or the Secretary before the limitations period had expired.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, there was no evidence that a treating physician discussed preeclampsia with appellants during post-delivery or during visits after the wife was treated in the hospital for eclampsia. Thus, pursuant to Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 12 and 23, the occurrence-based statute of limitations was unconstitutional as applied to appellants. The trial court also erred in granting summary judgment as to all claims pertaining to one physician where, following the medical review panel's decision, appellants submitted an expert affidavit that provided sufficient evidence to refute the medical review panel's opinion. However, the trial court did not err in denying summary judgment on the negligent counseling claim as appellants lacked sufficient information prior to their January 2000 discussions with another physician to know that they had been ill-advised as to the dangers of future pregnancies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a rehearing solely on the court's decision not to address his constitutional proportionality claim. The court agreed and granted a rehearing to respond to defendant's argument that the penalty for identity deception under Ind.

Code &sect; 35-44-2-3. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's proportionality claim. Identity deception required that a person knowingly or intentionally obtained, possessed, transferred, or used the identifying information of another, and impersonating a public servant had no such requirement. Additionally, the two crimes might result in exactly the same penalty. The fact that no person was harmed or defrauded was not a defense in a prosecution for identity deception. The court concluded that the penalty was not so severe or entirely out of proportion so as to shock public sentiment and was not unconstitutionally disproportionate as compared with the penalty for impersonation of a public servant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent took an interlocutory appeal from an order of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which denied respondent's motion to dismiss a delinquency petition alleging that he had committed acts of child molesting that would have violated Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-3 had they been committed by an adult.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent contended that &sect; 35-42-4-3 was inherently and unconstitutionally contradictory, was unconstitutionally vague, and violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. On review, the court affirmed, finding that the statute was constitutional as written and as applied to respondent. Under Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-42-4-3, 35-42-4-9, the mere fact that respondent fell within the protected class of the statute did not protect him from being charged with child molesting of a younger child. The provisions did not prescribe a minimum age for the perpetrator of the offense. The court found that Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-3 was not unconstitutionally vague under the First and Fourteenth Amendments because the language of the statute made it clear that it applied to a person who committed the requisite act. The statute did not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement because the provisions were satisfied if a person with the requisite intent engaged in defined sexual acts with a child under 14 years old. Finally, the court found that the statute did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Ind. Const. art. I., &sect; 23, in that it applied equally to all persons, regardless of age.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Planned Parenthood of Indiana (PPI), challenged the order of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which denied PPI's motion for a preliminary injunction against appellees, the Attorney General of the State of Indiana and the director of the Indiana Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (IMFCU), for the purpose of denying IMFCU unlimited access to the medical records of PPI's minor patients.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The IMFCU was investigating a complaint that PPI neglected 73 of its minor patients by allegedly failing to report child sexual abuse as required by Indiana law. The court held that enjoining IMFCU's investigation would not violate the separation of powers doctrine and that IMFCU was authorized by statute to conduct its investigation but that PPI had standing to raise a Fourteenth Amendment informational privacy claim on behalf of its minor patients. The court held that those patients had a limited constitutional right to privacy in their medical records and that the court was required to balance that right against IMFCU's interest in investigating complaints of patient neglect. The result of that inquiry resulted in the court concluding that PPI had demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of proving at trial that granting IMFCU's demand for unlimited access to the medical records of PPI's minor patients would violate the patients' constitutional privacy rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order denying PPI's motion for preliminary injunction and remanded the case to the trial court for it to immediately enter a preliminary injunction in favor of PPI against IMFCU's demand for unlimited access to the medical records. IMFCU was directed to immediately deliver any medical records in its possession to the trial court under seal, pending resolution of the trial on the merits of PPI's informational privacy claim.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-46-1-4, three counts of neglect of a dependent as a class D felony, and intimidation as a class A misdemeanor. He appealed, arguing in part that &sect; 35-46-1-4 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that the constitutional challenge would be more appropriately framed as an argument that the statute violated the Proportionality Clause, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. It stated that under the statute, if a jury found a defendant guilty of cruel confinement of a dependent, the jury could characterize the crime as either a class C felony or a class D felony. Thus, one defendant could receive a harsher sentence than another for the same crime, and the statute was unconstitutional. Accordingly, defendant's class C felony convictions were to be reduced to class D convictions. Next, defendant argued that the trial court had violated the double jeopardy provision of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 by convicting him of two counts of neglect as to each of three victims. The court stated that there was evidence that defendant hog-tied three victims with duct tape on at least one occasion, thus confining them pursuant to the first three counts, and that he locked each of them in a closet for an extended time on another, thus knowingly endangering their life or health pursuant to the last three counts. Thus, there was no double jeopardy violation under the &quot;essential elements&quot; test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reduced defendant's three class C felony convictions to class D felony convictions and remanded the case with instructions to the trial court to resentence defendant accordingly.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured patient appealed the grant of a petition for preliminary determination of law by the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) in favor of appellee doctors. The issue was whether the doctors' failure to file a copy of the proposed complaint cited in their petition was fatal to the trial court's judgment and whether the trial court erred in finding that the medical malpractice claim was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The treating doctor joined the dermatology practice of her father. Her mother worked as a nurse for the practice. The treating doctor performed a pulse laser procedure on the patient to remove a birthmark. The procedure left the patient with scarring and darkened pigmentation over an 80-square-inch area. Unbeknownst to the patient, the doctor was a narcotics addict. No one at the doctor's office ever informed the patient that the doctor had a history of addiction or that her license was suspended. The patient eventually discovered that the doctor's father and mother knew about her addiction issues. The doctors informed the trial court of the proposed complaint's filing date which was confirmed by the patient. The appellate court held the fact that the actual document was not before the trial court was not fatal to the doctors' petition. Also, it could not be concluded that the patient possessed enough information within two years after her laser procedure to lead a reasonably diligent person to conclude that malpractice had occurred. The patient presented enough evidence to at least raise a question of fact as to whether the doctrine of fraudulent concealment applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. The matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed a class action suit against defendants, the State of Indiana, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV), and its Commissioner, seeking to recover allegedly excessive excise taxes imposed by the BMV under Ind. Code &sect; 6-6-5-6. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) ordered the case transferred to the tax court. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The BMV changed its policy and split vehicle registrations to expire either in the middle or at the end of the applicable registration month, depending on the alphabetical order of the vehicle owner's name. The taxpayer argued he was required to pay 16 more days' excise tax than other taxpayers, simply by virtue of the spelling of his last name. The appellate court held that motor vehicle excise taxes were &quot;listed taxes&quot; under Ind. Code &sect; 6-8.1-1-1 and that, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 6-6-5-2(b), they were subject to Ind. Code &sect; 6-8.1. To exhaust his administrative remedies, a tax protester had to either pay the tax and request a refund under Ind. Code &sect; 6-8.1-9-1, or protest the tax at the assessment level and receive a letter of findings denying the protest. Instead, the taxpayer sought a refund under Ind. Code &sect; 6-6-5-7.7, which, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 6-6-5-7.4, was applicable to only to vehicles registered in and taxed by another state. Therefore, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, thereby depriving the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded with instructions to the trial court to dismiss the taxpayer's case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizen challenged the decision of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, a county auditor. The citizen brought a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking to have Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-20-3.2 declared unconstitutional. The case involved a petition/remonstrance proceeding wherein the citizen was precluded from joining in since he was a renter, not a property owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A plan was developed to renovate existing school facilities, funded by the school district incurring property tax-backed debt. Because the school district was planning to incur debt, notice was sent pursuant to &sect; 6-1.1-20-3.2. Owners of real property in the school district timely filed the sufficient number of signatures pursuant to &sect; 6-1.1-20-3.2 to initiate a petition and remonstrance process. The citizen claimed that &sect; 6-1.1-20-3.2 violated the Equal Protection Clause in that it restricted the right to participate in the petition/remonstrance process to owners of real property living within the political subdivision. The court agreed with the county auditor that the case was moot but addressed the constitutionality claim raised by the citizen since it fit within the public interest exception. The court concluded that &sect; 6-1.1-20-3.2 called for what amounted to a de facto election and that the State was not permitted to limit the right to participate to only those who own real property within the political subdivision without the showing of a compelling state interest, with such showing not having been made in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court was in error to grant summary judgment in favor of the county auditor and that the statute at issue was unconstitutional. The court stayed the effectiveness of its holding until such time as the Indiana General Assembly was provided an opportunity to redraft the statute. If the General Assembly did not take action by the time it adjourned, the holding applied to every petition/remonstrance procedure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed a pro se action against defendants, the Indiana Department of Correction and its employees. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) dismissed the complaint under Ind. Code &sect; 34-58-2-1 as the inmate had filed at least three previous civil actions that had been dismissed. The inmate appealed. He argued that the statute violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 12 and 23, the Open Courts Clause, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate set up a makeshift hammock and refused to come down until defendants made some copies for him. He was forced down with chemical spray and pepper balls, after which he filed his complaint. The court first held that the statute did not facially violate the Open Courts Clause. Like a statute of limitations, Ind. Code &sect; 34-58-2-1 limited the substantive right that gave rise to a claim. It did not infringe upon a fundamental right to seek redress in court and did not prevent the prosecution of any claim as long its conditions had been met. Furthermore, given the gravamen of the inmate's complaint, that he was injured after refusing to come down from his hammock, the statute was constitutional as applied to him. Next, &sect; 34-58-2-1 did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, given the State's interest in conserving judicial and administrative resources and the fact that offenders had been abusing these resources. Finally, the trial court was not required to find that the inmate was an abuser of litigation. The proper inquiry was whether three claims had been dismissed and whether the inmate was in immediate danger of serious bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-33-5-5(j), which would authorize the transfer of $57,000 in cash, jewelry, and the firearms, recovered during a search of appellant's home, to federal authorities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county deputy received information from a confidential informant who was &quot;pretty sure&quot; that defendant was selling marijuana from his home. The deputy stated that he had used this same informant 40 to 50 times in the past, although he could not recall more than three or four convictions arising from the informant's tips. The deputy searched defendant's garbage that was left out on the curb for pick up. After finding evidence of marijuana use in the garbage, the State obtained a search warrant for appellant's residence. During the search, the police found marijuana, cash, jewelry, and firearms. In the turnover proceeding, the lower court denied appellant's motion to suppress. Reversing, the court held that the deputy had not established a reasonable suspicion to search appellant's trash, as required by Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The search was based upon non-specific information that did not set forth an impending crime. The information was not sufficient to support the articulable, individualized suspicion required to conduct a search of the trash. The good faith exception did not apply because of the inherent unreliability of the information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after the township trustee began her term of office, the township board adopted two resolutions that, inter alia, required the trustee to obtain the board's approval for certain acquisitions by the trustee. The trustee entered into contracts for professional services without board approval and then filed a declaratory judgment action to determine the validity of the resolutions and her actions. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the Home Rule Act, Ind. Code &sect; 36-1-3-1 et seq., did not confer upon the board the statutory authority to pre-approve the trustee's contracts and purchases. Pursuant to Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 36-6-4-3, 36-1-4-7, the trustee had the power to receive and pay out township funds and to enter into contracts. The board could not unilaterally declare itself a &quot;governmental unit&quot; within the scope of the Act. Aside from encroaching upon the statutory role of the trustee, the resolutions would not promote efficiency. Consequently, the board did not demonstrate its entitlement to summary judgment, nor establish that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the trustee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty in the Dearborn Superior Court (Indiana) to attempted robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery, burglary, and conspiracy to commit burglary. He was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 150 years with forty-five years suspended. He appealed his convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his accomplice burglarized and assaulted two victims. The appellate court held an attempted robbery was part of a burglary conspiracy, so defendant's sentence could not exceed the maximum sentences for burglary and the episode comprised of attempted robbery and burglary conspiracy. He could not be convicted of conspiracy and attempt to commit one robbery. The victims' ages were a proper sentencing aggravator, as he admitted them. To the extent serious bodily injury was an attempted robbery element, it could not be a sentencing aggravator. It was not an element of burglary or conspiracy to commit burglary. His criminal history was not reliable. Lack of remorse could not be an aggravator, but the credibility of remorse could be observed in comment on the proceedings. Defendant's hearsay &quot;admissions&quot; to an officer were not aggravators. Facts the trial court stated about the crimes were not admissions, nor did a jury find them, but, on remand, the charging informations' facts, to which defendant admitted, could be considered to find if they were an aggravator. The trial court could find he took no responsibility and did not have to give his youth mitigating weight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's robbery conspiracy conviction was reversed, as was his sentence. His convictions for burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, and attempted robbery were affirmed, and the matter was remanded to vacate the robbery conspiracy conviction and for resentencing. Aggravators and mitigators had to be properly considered upon resentencing, and the new sentence could not exceed an aggregate of 105 years.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, noting that Ind. Code &sect;&nbsp;35-42-2-2 provided graduation of the criminal penalties on the basis that additional elements regarding the manner in which a person committed the offense steadily increased the chance that serious injury might arise. Defendant also argued that &sect; 35-42-2-2 was unconstitutionally vague because it would allow a shooter to be charged with a Class C felony for shooting into an empty field because an empty field was conceivably a place where &quot;people are likely to gather.&quot; The appellate court found no merit in defendant's argument as applied to the instant action, concluding that the victim's home, where defendant shot, was both a dwelling and a residence, and resort to the challenged language of &sect;&nbsp;35-42-2-2 was not necessary.</SPAN></P>

The court addressed the issues of whether defendant's conduct violated the statute and whether the statute violated her right to due process under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a civilian employee of a work release center, and while off-duty, she and an inmate had consensual sexual relations in a motel while the inmate was out of the facility on an 8-hour pass. Defendant contended that she was not a &quot;service provider,&quot; that the inmate was not in &quot;custody,&quot; and that the statute violated her due process and privacy protections. The court observed that while criminal statutes were to be construed narrowly, the statute was clear in its language that it covered defendant and the inmate, because even while out on a pass, he was subject to lawful detention. Therefore defendant was subject to the prohibitions of the statute. As to defendant's due process and privacy constitutional claims, the court held that the statute was presumed to be constitutional, and that because there was a legitimate State interest in not allowing favoritism or retaliation of inmates and in the orderly operation of institutions, the statute as applied to defendant was not unconstitutional. As to defendant's privacy interest claim, the court observed that only unreasonable intrusions on privacy were unconstitutional, and that the statute was not such an intrusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant library challenged a judgment of the Vanderburgh Circuit Court (Indiana), which granted appellee library's motion to dismiss. Appellant contended that the circuit court had erred in interpreting Ind. Code &sect; 36-12-7-8 to allow appellee to calculate the amount of tax necessary to support appellant's budget, and that the levy was arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was a private donation library and appellee was a publicly funded library, and therefore a political subdivision. Appellant submitted a budget to appellee and appellee published a notice of a public meeting regarding budgeting. As a result of the meeting, appellee adopted a budget that was less than that sought by appellant and appellant filed its action, contending that appellee was required to pass the levy as submitted by appellant. On appeal, the court held that the rules of statutory construction prohibited interpretation of a statute that was not ambiguous, and that the constitutionality of the statute was to be presumed. The Private Donation Library Statute provided that the taxing authority must levy the tax, which, in turn, meant that it must &quot;fix&quot; the budget, tax rate, and tax levy. To hold otherwise would have allowed a private entity to levy a tax, which would have been unconstitutional. The court therefore reasoned that the legislature did not intend the tax levy to be a purely ministerial function and appellee had not acted improperly by reducing the proposed levy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Next, the appellate court concluded that the denial of defendant's motion for a continuance was not grounds for reversal since defendant suffered no definitive prejudice resulting therefrom. While the appellate court concluded that it was improper for the prosecutor to express a personal opinion as to the merits of the case, the error did not require reversal where defendant suffered no prejudice. The appellate court also upheld the OWI statute as constitutional. Finally, the appellate court concluded that defendant's disorderly conduct conviction did not violate Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a husband and a wife, were charged with various drug offenses. They filed a motion to suppress the physical evidence seized from their property on the ground that a search of their trash violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11. The Franklin Circuit Court (Indiana) denied the motion. Defendants filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer received a telephone call from an anonymous person who said that the husband was manufacturing methamphetamine and growing marijuana at his home. The caller also said that the husband had a suspended driver's license, which the officer later verified. The police decided to ride along with the private trash service that picked up defendants' trash. After the trash was picked up, the police searched the trash, which contained evidence of drug activity. The court first held that the search was improper because the tip was insufficiently reliable to give rise to a reasonable suspicion. Although the tip provided the police with information about the driver's license, it lacked any information that would allow the police to corroborate the claim that illegal activity was afoot. The good faith exception of Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-4-5, however, applied. At the time of the search, case law did not require articulable suspicion for trash searches. Under the reasonableness standard existing at the time, the search was proper. The trash service collected the trash on the day it normally did, and the trooper did not enter the property but merely supervised the collection process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of class D felony criminal confinement and three counts of class D felony identity deception after three separate incidents in which he called three different restaurants pretending to be a radio disc jockey from a specific radio station running a contest in which a restaurant employee would go to defendant's house where the employee would undress in return for winning a prize. At defendant's jury trial, one of the victims identified him by stating that defendant was wearing a &quot;jail armband.&quot; The trial court denied defendant's mistrial motion. Defendant was convicted on all charges. Before entering the convictions, the trial court merged the identity deception into the criminal confinement counts and convicted defendant only on the criminal confinement counts. The trial court also imposed a $400 jury fee. On appeal, the appellate court found the mistrial motion was properly denied, the criminal confinement statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, the identity deception statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, and the imposition of a $400 jury fee exceeded the trial court's $2 statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants alleged the judge's cash-only bond policy denied them equal access to the jails in violation of &sect; 27-10-3-18; that the bond statute,&nbsp;Ind.

Code &sect;&nbsp;35-33-8-7(2)(e). The appellate court held that as the granting of bail was within a judge's discretionary judicial actions, and there was no evidence he acted without jurisdiction, the trial court properly found the judge had judicial immunity from suits for money damages. This absolute judicial immunity extended to the clerk and chief of police who enforced the judge's policy. Appellants lacked standing to challenge the bond statute, as the protected class consisted of persons who were incarcerated and required to make bail, and the only harm to appellants was a possible reduction in demand for their business. Further, the bail agent failed to show how he fell within &quot;extreme circumstances,&quot; which were required to grant him taxpayer standing. He also lacked standing as a taxpayer to complain about an alleged violation of &sect;&nbsp;35-33-8-7(2)(e).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee town sued appellant restaurant in the Hendricks Superior Court (Indiana), alleging that the restaurant's sign had lost its status as a preexisting nonconforming use. The restaurant counterclaimed that the town's interpretation and enforcement of an ordinance was an unconstitutional taking. The court granted the town's motion for summary judgment, and ordered the restaurant to remove the sign from its property. The restaurant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When it opened for business, the restaurant received permission from a county planning and building department to construct a freestanding highway identification sign on its property. Sometime thereafter, an annexation occurred, whereby the restaurant came under the town's jurisdiction. After the town enacted Plainfield, Ind., Ordinance No. 21-97, it was subsequently determined that the restaurant's sign violated the provisions of the ordinance because it exceeded height and surface area limitations. However, the sign qualified as a preexisting, legally established, nonconforming structure as defined in the ordinance. The trial court ruled that the sign lost its status as a legally established nonconforming structure in accordance with the town's zoning ordinance when the restaurant had a contractor remove the sign from its pole to perform maintenance on the sign before replacing the sign. On appeal, the court found that, under the definitions in the ordinance, that the restaurant moved its sign and sign structure. Hence, under the plain language of the ordinance, that movement caused the restaurant's pole sign to lose its nonconforming use status.</SPAN></P>

When the officer searched the trash, a subsequent appellate decision was not available as precedent. Thus, the officer conducted the trash search in a manner consistent with applicable case law at the time. Thus, in searching defendant's home, the officer relied in good faith, under Ind.

The trial court considered defendant's criminal history and the seriousness of the offense as aggravating circumstances and his age as a mitigating circumstance. The appellate court noted that based on the sentencing ranges for the offenses, under Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-7.1(d), the trial court was permitted to impose a 16-year sentence regardless of the aggravators and mitigators; therefore, its allegedly improper consideration of aggravating and mitigation circumstances could not result in a sentencing error. In view of the extensive discretion afforded to trial courts under Indiana's revised sentencing system, the appellate court urged them to continue issuing detailed sentencing statements pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-3(3) so as to facilitate appellate review of the appropriateness of sentences under Ind. R. App. P. 7(B). Defendant's Rule 7(B) claim that his 16-year sentence was not appropriate was waived because, by agreeing to a plea that allowed for an executed sentence &quot;capped&quot; at 16 years, he implicitly agreed that any total sentence up to 16 years was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was prescribed acne medicine by the two doctors. The patient subsequently had to undergo open heart surgery due to heart disease. The patient later met an emergency room doctor who informed the patient that there was a possible link between his heart disease and the use of the acne medicine. The appellate court held that the patient did not have to know with certainty that malpractice caused his injury in order to trigger Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1(b). Even if there continued to be doubts about the cause of the heart disease or the possibility of malpractice, the information provided by the emergency room doctor was sufficient to require the patient to promptly seek additional medical and legal advice to assist them in deciding whether to seek legal recourse. Thus, the emergency room visit was the discovery date because it was on that date that the emergency room doctor informed the patient of a possible link between his heart disease and the acne medicine. The patient filed the complaint more than 18 months after that conversation. In the appellate court's view, that delay was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State took custody of the shareholder's corporate stock and certain dividends that had been deemed abandoned. The State later sold the stock. The shareholder made a claim for the stock and any accruements. The State approved the claim and sent the shareholder the amount of the sale proceeds, plus the dividends that had been earned but not paid before it took custody of the stock, but it retained the interest that had accrued after the stock's liquidation. The shareholder claimed that Ind. Code &sect; 32-34-1-31(c) required the State to pay him the value of his stock on the date it was delivered to the Indiana Attorney General. However, the court noted that the statute referred to the payment of a valid claim that was made for any securities in the possession of the Attorney General. The shareholder made his claim two years after the stock was sold. Thus, at the time the claim was made, the securities were not in the possession of the Attorney General. The court concluded that the retention of interest by the State pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 32-34-1-29 did not constitute an unconstitutional taking. Furthermore, the payment of the net proceeds of the sale of the stock was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Madison Circuit Court (Indiana) entered a final judgment of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of child molesting, a class A felony. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was five or six years old when she spent the night at the apartment of her mother's friend. Defendant also stayed there that evening. During the night, he allegedly forced the victim to submit to sexual intercourse. The victim did not tell anyone about the alleged incident until two or three years later. Defendant was then charged with child molesting. Defendant claimed at trial that he had not molested the victim, but instead that another person had done so on a prior occasion. A doctor testified about her examination of the victim. The doctor acknowledged that she could not determine what had caused the injury, when it happened, or who had caused the injury. Defendant was not allowed to cross-examine the doctor or the victim about the victim's alleged prior molestation. Defendant then made an offer of proof that the jury, through defendant's cross-examination, should hear evidence of the prior molestation. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the appellate court found that defendant's Sixth Amendment right to cross-examination had been violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a patient and his wife, challenged a summary judgment from the Laporte Superior Court (Indiana), which was in favor of appellee cardiologist on the patient's medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient, and the wife through consortium claims, alleged personal injuries as a result of unnecessary antibiotic treatment following a purported misdiagnosis by the cardiologist. The cardiologist moved for summary judgment on the basis of the statute of limitations (SOL) at Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1. The superior court granted the motion and the patient appealed. The court found the act that commenced running the SOL was the cardiologist's misinterpretation of the echocardiogram, which occurred outside the limitations period. Moreover, under the discovery doctrine, the latest the patient should have discovered the injury was when he experienced symptoms from the unnecessary treatment, which also occurred outside the limitations period. The SOL was not tolled by fraudulent concealment or the continuing wrong doctrine as there was no evidence that the cardiologist concealed any fact and the cardiologist's continued treatment of the patient did not warrant application of the continuing wrong doctrine. He did not have a continuing duty regarding his misdiagnosis from years earlier. Finally, since the patient's main claim failed, the consortium claim also failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment for the cardiologist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a joint county drainage board, established certain portions of a river and its tributary branches as a regulated drain. Appellees -- cities, towns, a corporation, an association, a conservancy district, and individuals -- sought review; appellee Director of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) intervened. The Noble Circuit Court (Indiana) vacated the order and remanded the matter to the board, which appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board granted the request of county commissioners to create regulated drains running through two nature preserves and DNR wetland conservation areas. The trial court vacated the order because, inter alia, the commissioners failed to establish a particularized need to drain a specific public highway and therefore exceeded the scope of the authority granted to them under Ind. Code &sect; 36-9-27-54(b)(2). The appellate court agreed; the commissioners' rote listing of nearly every road in the watershed was insufficient to comply with &sect; 36-9-27-54(b)(2). And under Ind. Code &sect; 14-31-1-7(8) of the Indiana Nature Preserves Act, Ind. Code &sect; 14-31 et seq., as the board's order entailed modification or encroachment of the nature preserves, it was a &quot;taking&quot; of the preserves, and its failure to make a finding of necessity and to obtain the governor's approval rendered the order invalid. The order also imposed an implicit duty on the DNR to accept the placement and maintenance of a drain, in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 36-1-3-8(a)(3). Under Ind. Code &sect; 36-9-27-65, one of the cities and its conservancy district lacked standing to appeal as they waived their right to object to the board's order.</SPAN></P>

The court, sua sponte, also addressed the search incident to an arrest exception and the inventory exception and found that neither supported the State's position. The search of defendant's vehicle occurred after the vehicle was towed to the towing company's building; thus, the search was incident to an arrest exception was inapplicable because the search did not occur contemporaneously in both time and place with defendant's arrest. As for the inventory exception, the appellate court found that the State failed to meet its burden to show that the decision to impound the vehicle was in keeping with established departmental routine or regulation.

Before the sentencing hearing, defendant filed a motion to suppress and a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The Tippecanoe Superior Court (Indiana) denied the motion to withdraw the guilty plea and sentenced defendant to 25 years, with five suspended. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court should have granted his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because the trial court had not yet accepted the plea. The appellate court noted that such was not a dispositive factor in determining whether the trial court should have granted the motion. Defendant also maintained that the granting of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea was necessary to correct a manifest injustice because, after he entered his plea, the Indiana Supreme Court decided Litchfield, which defendant claimed established a credible defense that was not previously available. In Litchfield, it was decided that in order for officers to conduct a &quot;trash pull,&quot; the officers must possess an articulable individualized suspicion, essentially the same as required for a Terry stop of an automobile, that the individual was engaged in illegal activity. The appellate court agreed that the trial court should have granted defendant's motion because he should have been given a fair opportunity to vindicate his Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;11 rights against unreasonable search and seizure as enunciated in Litchfield.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer found a plant called khat in defendant's vehicle during a traffic stop. A crime lab chemist testified that the plant was widely cultivated in Arabia and parts of Africa and contained a naturally occurring stimulant compound called cathinone. Cathinone was not a listed drug under Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-48-2-4 or 35-48-2-6. The chemist testified that cathinone was chemically similar to methcathinone, which was a controlled substance. The trial court found that because the effect of the two drugs were similar, cathinone was a controlled substance analog under Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-1-9.3. Defendant argued that the conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence. The appellate court held that the State was required to prove that the analog substance had an effect on the central nervous system substantially similar to or greater than the effect of the controlled substance. The chemist testified that he had no knowledge of the comparative effects of cathinone and methcathinone.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigation arose from extraordinary rainfall, and the flooding that resulted. The trial court granted summary judgment on the claims asserted by the homeowners, and they sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the trial court did not err by finding that the city was immune under Ind. Code &sect; 34-13-3-1(7) from the negligence and nuisance claims. The appellate court determined that the city was performing a discretionary function when it commissioned and adopted a storm water plan. Notwithstanding governmental immunity, the homeowners failed to present any evidence to support their allegation that the city negligently operated and maintained the sewer system. Next, there was no taking of any actual physical part of the homeowners' real estate, nor were any important rights attached to the real estate taken. There was no permanent physical occupation of any definable part of the homeowners' property, and there was no transfer of a definable part of the homeowners' properties. To the contrary, the homeowners or tenants continued to live in their homes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court erred when it terminated his parental rights to his daughter. The appellate court disagreed, noting, among other things, that the condition that resulted in the child's removal, the father's incarceration and consequent inability to provide her, was not likely to be remedied within a meaningful time. In addition, several factors weighed in favor of the trial court's conclusion that termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interests: the child was in need of stability and permanency, the child was doing well in her current placement, and there was no guarantee that the father would be a suitable parent once he was released or that he would even obtain custody. The father also argued that he was denied due process because certain actions taken did not satisfy statutory requirements. The appellate court found no violation. Among other things, earlier notification about the child's removal from the mother's home would have made no difference as the father could not have done anything to change the situation. Finally, the court concluded that Ind. Code &sect; 31-35-2-4.5(a)(2)(B) does not violate the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the trial court erred when it refused to set aside the tax deed that was issued to the buyer. The appellate court found that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-25-16 (Section 16) had to be strictly applied, as a person may defeat a tax title only by proving one of the seven defects. The corporation did not show or even assert the existence of any of the defects listed in Section 16. The corporation did not allege that any part of the tax sale process or issuance of the tax deed did not comply with the tax sale statutes. There was nothing for the trial court to correct. Because the corporation failed to inform the auditor's office of its change of address, it could not complain that it was misinformed about the status of taxes due or that it had no reason to know that the corporation's property was scheduled for tax sale. The corporation did not file an Ind. R. Trial P. 60(B) motion at the trial court challenging the tax deed. Because the corporation did not assert the Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 argument at the trial court, it waived it for review. The limitation in Section 16 of the ways to defeat a tax sale did not violate a substantive due process right.</SPAN></P>

The unit owner had died during the proceedings and the personal representative became a party. The association had filed a complaint for injunctive relief against the unit owner, alleging a violation of a covenant against leasing her residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association's declaration had a restrictive covenant that prohibited leasing of a residence. When the unit owner went into a nursing home, her residence was leased to others. The personal representative admitted that she was renting the residence but asserted that the covenant against leasing was unenforceable as a violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3601-3619. A bench trial was held and a judgment was entered in favor of the personal representative that held that the covenant against leasing violated the Fair Housing Act since it had a disparate impact on African Americans as the majority of the units in the association were owned by white persons and only two dwellings were owned by African Americans, with the unit owner's being one of those dwellings. The court upheld the judgment in favor of the personal representative, finding that the association provided a bona fide and legitimate justification for the covenant based on having a positive effect on property values but that the personal representative showed that less discriminatory alternatives existed, namely enforcing the maintenance of the properties and their value by the other declaration covenants.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from his home, alleging that the search warrant was invalid because the police officer who applied for the same was never sworn in when she gave probable cause testimony. At the suppression hearing, the prosecutor conceded that the officer was never placed under oath. The court upheld the trial court's grant of defendant's motion to suppress because the warrant was not properly issued since it lacked an oath or affirmation to support the officer's testimony. Further, the court held that in order to satisfy the good faith exception to the warrant requirement, the warrant required proper issuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his 40-year sentence which was imposed by the St. Joseph Superior Court (Indiana) after he pled guilty to class A felony robbery. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him by relying upon an improper aggravating factor, the offense, and by failing to find that his guilty plea and his mental illness constituted mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant picked out a random victim, had him give him his money, and then shot him in the chest. The trial court failed to articulate its reasoning, balancing, and evaluation of the aggravating factors. Defendant's criminal history revealed that upon reaching majority, he had a consistent and steady record of criminal activity. The fact that defendant was on probation for two offenses when he committed robbery was properly considered in enhancing his sentence. Defendant's arrest record and criminal history were aggravating factors. The circumstances of the robbery constituted an aggravating factor of high weight. Defendant was entitled to have some mitigating weight extended to his guilty plea, however, not significant weight. While he suffered from bipolar disorder, it appeared that he was capable of controlling his behavior, did not have significant limitations on his functioning, and failed to identify a nexus between his mental illness and the robbery. Thus, the failure to identify the proffered mitigating factors constituted error. However, the error was harmless because the record supported the finding of the two aggravating circumstances identified by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress, and defendant pursued an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer saw defendant and others enter a car without a license plate. The appellate court held an investigatory stop began when the officer ordered defendant out of the car and told him to put his hands on the car's trunk, as a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave. Before the car was driven, which would have been a crime, the officer sought identification. He became suspicious when defendant could not produce a social security number. The officer had no reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. A claim that a crime was about to be committed was speculative and failed as defendant was not in the driver's seat. The officer said he thought defendant tried to hide his identity but did not say what criminal activity he thought had or was about to take place, so an inability to provide a social security number gave rise only to a hunch. The unlawful investigative stop preceded a search of defendant's person revealing contraband. But for the stop, the contraband would not have been seized. The intrusion violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a school corporation, challenged the order of the Lake County Domestic Relations Court (Indiana), which enjoined appellee employees from striking but also ordered the school to contribute money to a health and insurance trust fund for the employees in connection with the grant of the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The school had brought suit seeking injunctive relief to prevent the employees from striking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance fund had informed the school that it was facing insolvency if additional contributions were not made by the school on behalf of the employees. The school never responded and the fund informed the parties that to preserve solvency, it was forced to cut benefits, including eliminating all benefits for dependents of the employees. In response to that drastic cut in benefits, the employees went on strike. The school brought suit and obtained the injunction it sought against the employees to stop the strike but it was also ordered to make the additional contributions. The school, on appeal, asserted that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing the condition that required them to pay a higher amount to the insurance fund than it had agreed to under contract. The court agreed that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing the condition that the school contribute a higher amount to the insurance fund. The court noted that the injunction enjoining the employees from committing illegal activity, namely striking, was proper but that the order requiring the school to contribute to the insurance fund was not a reasonable condition to maintain the status quo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, in part, the trial court's grant of the injunction enjoining the employees from striking but reversed that part of the order that required the school to make an additional contribution to the insurance fund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sought review of the judgment of the Clinton Circuit Court (Indiana), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant doctor on the patient's claim for medical malpractice on the ground that the suit was filed outside the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1(b) (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor performed a hip replacement surgery on the patient and placed a certain type of prosthesis in the patient's hip. After the surgery, the patient continued to experience problems with her hip dislocating. Almost 20 months after the initial surgery, the doctor referred the patient to an orthopedic surgeon who removed the prosthesis and replaced it with a different type of prosthesis. The trial court found that the patient's suit was untimely filed and granted summary judgment to the doctor. On appeal, the court found that the patient should have known that she had a potential malpractice claim, at the absolute latest, when the prosthesis was replaced, which was more than two years before suit was brought; thus, the suit was filed outside the period set forth in &sect; 34-18-7-1(b). However, the affidavit of a doctor submitted by the patient established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the doctor's installation of an obsolete prosthesis, followed by treatment with prescription pain medication and failure to recommend revision after more than six months had passed since surgery, constituted a continuing wrong so as to have tolled the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In recording a mortgage assignment, a company listed a business address. It later changed its name, moved to a new address and, ultimately, merged into the bank. The county mortgage records were never corrected to reflect the name and address changes. The bank began a foreclosure action sometime after the LLC obtained a tax sale certificate for the property. The auditor sent tax deed notices to the address listed in the county records and signed mail receipts came back. After the auditor issued a tax deed, the LLC began a quiet title action, which was consolidated into the bank's foreclosure. The trial court voided the tax deed for inadequate notice. On appeal, the parties disputed whether notice to the address in the county records substantially complied with notice obligations under Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 6-1.1-25-4.5, -4.6, and with due process. The court found the auditor was not obliged to search for addresses outside of the county records because the notices were not returned as undeliverable and mail receipts confirmed delivery. Also, the bank had an obligation during the two years it held a mortgage interest to ensure the county records of that interest were correct.</SPAN></P>

The informant told police that defendant was his source and that he had additional drugs in his second floor bedroom at his house. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by admitting evidence discovered during the search of his house. Defendant claimed that the affidavit in support of the search warrant did not contain probable cause to support the issuance of the search warrant because the police failed to corroborate the informant's hearsay or demonstrate its credibility. The appellate court agreed, noting that the informant's statement was not against his own penal interest as it did not implicate him in any additional crimes. The informant's knowledge of defendant's address and defendant's prior convictions could not support a finding of probable cause where police failed to corroborate such information. The court concluded, however, that the warrant was not so facially deficient that the executing officers could not reasonably presume it to be valid and thus, the evidence was admissible under the good faith exception.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion to dismiss that defendant filed in which defendant claimed that the statute under which she was charged was unconstitutional. On defendant's interlocutory appeal, the appellate court found that it did not need to address her constitutional challenge because she lacked standing to challenge the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants appealed an order of the Marion Superior Court, Indiana, which refused to require the prosecutor to permit them to participate in a pretrial diversion program, notwithstanding their inability to pay the $ 230 in fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispositive issue on appeal was whether requiring payment of a fee as an absolute condition of participating in a pretrial diversion program violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The pretrial diversion statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 33-39-1-8, did not require the payment of fees as an absolute condition of participation in a pretrial diversion program. The instant court concluded that precluding defendants from participating in the pretrial diversion program based solely on their asserted inability to pay the $ 230 in fees violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The argument that the fees helped offset the costs of running the pretrial diversion program was not sufficient to establish a rational basis for distinguishing between the indigent and those able to pay the fees. The concept that the criminal justice system should be operated as far as reasonably possible without regard to a defendant's financial resources was axiomatic and beyond dispute. Allowing some defendants and not others to completely avoid prosecution and a potential criminal conviction, based solely on their abilities to pay certain fees, violated this fundamental principle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In sentencing defendant, the trial court found three aggravating factors that it used to enhance his sentence, namely, his criminal history, consisting of only juvenile adjudications, that he was in need of correctional or rehabilitative treatment, and that imposition of a reduced or suspended sentence would have depreciated the seriousness of the offense. The court held that the trial court's reliance on each of those aggravating factors was improper and, therefore, defendant was entitled to the presumptive sentence. The court held that juvenile convictions were not proper considerations under Blakely/Apprendi and using defendant's prior juvenile adjudications, without having the matters submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt, violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-4 was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. The appellate court found that it was overbroad but not substantially so. Ind.

Code &sect; 35-42-4-4(c) applied to written descriptions of child pornography, virtual child pornography, and pornography showing youthful-looking adults. However, these arguably impermissible applications of the statute did not amount to more than a tiny fraction of the materials within the statute's reach. Defendant did not argue that the alleged child pornography found on his work computer was outside the permissible reach of &sect; 35-42-4-4. Defendant did not show that regulation of child pornography was an abuse of his right to expression. Child pornography was not political expression and was not a &quot;core&quot; value. A rationality review was used to determine if the State could reasonably have concluded that, to the extent defendant's activity was expressive, it was an &quot;abuse&quot; of his right to expression. The State's interest in protecting child welfare easily passed this standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of conviction and sentence of the Hancock Circuit Court (Indiana), which convicted defendant for class B felony robbery and class D felony resisting law enforcement. Defendant was sentenced to a 20-year term for the robbery conviction and a three-year term for the resisting law enforcement conviction, to have been served concurrently. .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence arose from a bank robbery. Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court committed fundamental error when it failed to instruct the jury on the elements of resisting law enforcement. The court found no error, however, because the jury heard the charging instrument twice, and the prosecution referred to the elements in its closing argument. Sufficient evidence was found to have supported defendant's convictions, because it was not necessary that the State was to prove that defendant personally committed every act constituting the perpetration of the offenses since he aided another and was, therefore, chargeable as a principal. While driving away, defendant told his accomplice not to stop, which demonstrated his participation in the fleeing. The fact that defendant's BB gun was unloaded did not defeat his robbery conviction, because the gun was still considered a deadly weapon as the bank tellers testified that they were in fear, as did the customers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Delaware Circuit Court (Indiana) of two counts of burglary, two counts of criminal confinement, criminal deviate conduct, and child molesting. He appealed, alleging that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated when he was required to give a DNA sample, and that his counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A masked man entered a 14-year-old girl's home at night and raped her. Several months later, a masked man entered another home at night and molested a seven-year-old girl. Later, defendant was charged with violating probation and was ordered to provide a DNA sample, which was sent to the State' DNA database. DNA retrieved from the two victims matched defendant's, and he was charged with those crimes. He then appealed his probation revocation, arguing that the statute requiring probationers to give DNA samples was unconstitutional; this claim failed because he had not raised it below. The trial court in the instant case, in ruling on defendant's motion to suppress the DNA tests, held that he was collaterally estopped from relitigating the constitutionality of the taking of his DNA. The appellate court agreed. Further, once the DNA sample was collected, defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy in it. That defendant's probation revocation proceeding was untimely filed had no effect upon the validity of the order requiring him to provide a DNA sample; thus, his counsel was not ineffective for not objecting to the taking of defendant's DNA pursuant to that order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed a denial, by the Kosciusko Superior Court (Indiana), of his request for post-conviction relief from revocation of his parole by respondent Indiana Parole Board. He challenged the constitutionality and validity of special conditions imposed under Ind. Code &sect; 11-13-3-4, and also challenged the evidentiary basis for the revocation itself under Ind. Code &sect; 11-13-3-10, as well as the constitutionality of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, convicted of molesting a young boy, agreed to several special conditions when he was paroled, most prominently, that he would not use the Internet except in the course of employment by his entertainment company and that he would not solicit work that would bring him in contact with children. Parole revocation proceedings commenced after he contacted others in the entertainment business, sometimes using e-mail, about his ideas for projects that included several that required large casts of young boys, as well as one planned video that sounded like a justification for the events that had led to his original conviction. The court held, first, that the two challenged conditions were not violations of due process or freedom of association (which was quite limited for a parolee), although another condition was unconstitutionally vague. It did not matter that some of the evidence considered by the board was hearsay since the board could consider any relevant evidence. The revocation proceedings had met basic due process standards, and the inmate had not been deprived of his good time credits since they helped him to gain early parole, which he then lost through his own acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the Lake Superior Court (Indiana) with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and operating a vehicle while intoxicated endangering a person.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was a 15-month delay between defendant's arrest and the filing of charges. The appellate court held the State's failure to serve its notice of appeal on defendant or counsel did not require the appeal's dismissal, as serving a notice of appeal was not jurisdictional, and the appellate court's procedural rules were only a means to achieve orderly and speedy justice. The delay in filing charges was within the 24-month statute of limitations period for a misdemeanor, in Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-4-2(a)(2) (2004). As the interval between accusation and trial did not cross the threshold between ordinary and presumptively prejudicial delay, factors used to analyze prejudicial delay were not invoked. Defendant did not show the delay was unduly prejudicial, as he made no specific or concrete prejudice claims supported by evidence, so it was error to find his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated. Neither the arresting officer nor any other government official intentionally delayed processing arrest paperwork upon which defendant's charges were based to gain a tactical advantage, so the State did not violate defendant's right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the jury selection system in the county did not deprive defendant of his right to a trial by a jury of his peers as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI and XIV because the county's computerized selection of potential jurors from voter registration lists and bureau of motor vehicle records satisfied Ind. Code &sect; 33-28-4-3 and constitutional requirements. The court found also that the State's explanation for striking, through a peremptory challenge, the only black person in the jury pool was sufficiently race neutral. The prosecutor explained that he struck the juror because he was a pastor and he never accepted pastors or ministers on his jury panel because they were more apt for forgiveness. The court found that the prosecutor's statement, which bore on the pastor's religious affiliation, was improper; however, the court found that the record showed that the primary motivation for the strike was not the pastor's religious affiliation; rather, it was his stated lack of respect and confidence in the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a mother, her husband, and her two year old son, filed suit against defendants after the mother, her son, aunt and mother-in-law were in a car accident.

The mother and son were injured, and the aunt and mother-in-law were killed. One of the deceased passengers was decapitated. A jury awarded compensatory damages of $ 1,145,000 and $ 15 million in punitive damages. In accordance with Ind.

On appeal, the court found that punitive damages were not appropriate, noting that the driver was not speeding and there was no evidence that he was drowsy or intoxicated. The court found also that there was simply no evidence to support an award of punitive damages against the moving company directly because plaintiffs failed to offer proof that the company consciously disregarded knowledge that the driver was a substantial danger to motorists.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff undocumented aliens appealed from a summary judgment entered by the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) in favor of defendant Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) in the aliens' constitutional challenge to the BMV's enactment, without promulgation under the Indiana Administrative Rules and Procedures Act (ARPA), Ind. Code &sect; 4-22-2 et seq., of a directive requiring driver license applicants to produce several types of identification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had held that the aliens lacked standing to pursue their class action challenge. The court on review held that regardless of the type of identification document being sought, the aliens had standing because the social security documents they lacked should not have been used as a pretext for denying the documents where Indiana law actually provided an alternative procedure for applicants without social security numbers. Although the aliens challenged the new directive on constitutional grounds, the court did not reach that issue. As a rule of general application to the public at large, rather than an internal agency directive, the rule had to have been adopted after following the procedures set forth in ARPA, but the BMV had not followed those procedures. Therefore, even though Ind. Code &sect; 9-24-9-2 empowered the agency to set driver license issuance requirements, its directive was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment in favor of the BMV and remanded the matter with directions to enter summary judgment in favor of the aliens.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney sought review of the judgment of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which dismissed the attorney's writ of mandate action against appellees, the members of the Workers' Compensation Board, for lack of standing as a member of the public, as an attorney, and under the public standing doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney's practice included representing employees before the Board. The attorney filed a verified complaint for writs of mandate which alleged that members of the Board violated the Worker's Compensation Act, Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 22-3-1-1 et seq. The attorney cited no specific incident or episode in which he was harmed by the alleged violations but instead filed his action on behalf of the residents of Indiana. The attorney claimed he was injured because attorneys such as himself lacked access to a full-time Board. The appellate court held that although the attorney presented a hypothetical scenario in which the Board's unavailability could or would delay payments due him, he alleged no incidents when the harm actually occurred. In the absence of a showing that he had suffered or would immediately suffer a direct injury, there was no standing under the general rule. The Board's alleged failure to fulfill its statutory obligations under the Act harmed an injured worker's attorney only incidentally, if at all. The nexus of harm had to be more direct to confer standing under the public interest exception. Therefore, he was not the proper party to seek an action of mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were the parents of a child born out-of-wedlock. The mother had both legal and physical custody of the child, with parenting time to the father. The father contended on appeal that the trial court erred by including overtime hours in his income for purposes of calculating his child support obligation. The court upheld the trial court's calculation of the father's weekly gross income, which was based on the father's average income for a three-year period. The court found no error with regard to that portion of the trial court order requiring the father to satisfy the child support arrearage, because the trial court had the authority to order the support retroactive to any date after the filing of the petition to modify support. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's order requiring the parties to communicate only in writing, because the father had been making unannounced visits to the mother's home. Due to the father's fluctuating work schedule, the parenting time order was upheld, with the court advising the father that he was permitted to seek a modification if he was able to arrange a different work schedule.</SPAN></P>

The class representative then filed a summary judgment motion while the state corrections department filed a summary judgment cross-motion that asserted the executive directive did not violate any right the prisoners had. The trial court agreed with the state corrections department that neither state law nor federal constitutional law was violated. On appeal, the appellate court found that the executive directive did not violate the relevant state law, Ind. Code ? 11-11-3-9, regarding visits with prisoners and, indeed, was consistent with it. It also found that in regard to claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the executive directive was a reasonable restriction under the circumstances and that the executive directive was not cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a wife and her friends, appealed from a grant of summary judgment by the Porter Superior Court (Indiana) in favor of defendant husband in their action seeking to recover damages under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2520 and Ind. Code &sect; 35-33.5-5-4 for secretly taping their conversations, the content of which the husband allegedly used during subsequent dissolution proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both federal and Indiana wiretap statutes criminalizing unauthorized taping of private conversations provided civil remedies for victims. Although the husband and wife had originally acquired the taping equipment to investigate their suspicions regarding a son's possible involvement with drugs, the wife had no idea that the husband had later used the same equipment to record her conversations with family and friends. After noting that the trial court had inappropriately granted summary judgment without a request, it rejected, on the merits, the husband's argument that case law applying the federal statute had created an exception for interspousal recording when a spouse performed the actual interception, and that Indiana law had imported that exception. The only case that recognized such an exception had been overruled in one of the successor circuits to the one in which it had originally been decided, and had not been followed by other federal courts. Furthermore, Indiana's highest court had held that the Indiana statute was not to be interpreted as incorporating exemptions developed in federal case law. Thus, nothing precluded the wife and friends from seeking damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) convicting him of murder, criminal confinement, and arson, arguing that ballistics evidence admitted at trial was fruit of the poisonous tree, that the evidence was insufficient, and that imposition of consecutive sentences amounting to 120 years was a violation of his right to jury trial as well as unjust based on his lack of a past criminal record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A couple of years before the murders of which defendant was convicted, the murder weapon had been temporarily seized by a policeman who had been trying to defuse a tense neighborhood situation. At that time, ballistics information had been recorded, and the information was retrieved and used in prosecuting defendant for brutally abducting and then murdering a male cross-dresser and a woman after what he perceived as their humiliation of him and for burning up the car that contained their bodies. The appeals court held that since there was no probable cause for retaining and recording information about the gun, for which there was a permit, the evidence admitted at trial was fruit of the poisonous tree. Since it was merely cumulative of other evidence, particularly the damaging testimony of an accomplice that was sufficient in itself, even this constitutional error was harmless. Although defendant had a clean criminal record, there was no impropriety in the imposition of long consecutive sentences, since they were well within the ranges of statutory maximums and the trial court had explicitly stated that the brutality of the crimes outweighed any possible factors in mitigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that the four asbestos suppliers were responsible for the illness and death of deceased, who died from lung cancer that had been attributed to his occupational exposure to asbestos. The special statute of limitations set forth in Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-2 did not apply in the litigation because the suppliers did not both mine and sell asbestos. In earlier proceedings, the Indiana Supreme Court had determined that application of the 10-year statute of repose to plaintiff's case could raise constitutional issues, and the matter was remanded to the trial court. Upon remand, the trial court concluded that the deceased's asbestos-related illness did not manifest itself within the 10-year repose period and granted summary judgment because Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1 precluded plaintiff's cause of action. Affirming, the court held that application of the statute of repose to plaintiff's claim did not violate Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. Preclusion of plaintiff's claim did not violate the equal privileges and immunities clause under Ind. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The small town's election officials decided it would be most efficient to have three precincts vote at the same site. The losers challenged that practice and also based their challenge on the fact that officials had combined the electronic voting results of all three precincts before reporting them. The appellate court held, first, that the plain language of Ind. Code &sect; 3-10-7-22 actually authorized the combining of precinct voting sites in small communities and that there was no way either alleged irregularity could be said to have altered the outcome of the election or deprived voters of their right to vote. Furthermore, since the losers had never challenged the outcome of the election as invalid, their election contest could be called frivolous and in bad faith, justifying an award of trial attorney's fees. Furthermore, since the trial judge had warned the losers that they were running a risk of incurring sanctions if they appealed, appellate attorney's fees were also awarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of election contest relief but held that the winners were entitled to awards of both trial and appellate attorney's fees. It remanded for determination of appropriate awards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) to six counts of Class B felony robbery and one count of Class C felony robbery. The trial court imposed an aggravated sentence of multiple sentences with a total aggregate sentence of 36 years with 12 suspended for an executed sentence of 24 years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed at least seven businesses within the span of three weeks. Defendant or an accomplice was armed with a handgun in each of the robberies. Defendant was arrested and found to be in possession of an unlicensed handgun. Defendant argued that he was entitled to have a jury determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether aggravating circumstances existed before the trial court enhanced the sentences above the presumptive for each of the convictions and ordered some of the sentences to be served consecutively. On appeal, the court noted that it was the admission by defendant that defendant committed multiple violent crimes within a short period of time that the trial court relied upon in deciding that a slight aggravation of some of his sentences was warranted under Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-7.1(b). Therefore, defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated because the trial court enhanced defendant's sentence based only upon facts to which defendant admitted when he pleaded guilty. Finally, the court could not say that defendant's slightly aggravated sentence was inappropriate, under Ind. R. App. P. 7(B), in light of the nature of the offenses and the character of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Dearborn Circuit Court (Indiana), which convicted him for attempted escape as a Class B felony, two counts of battery as Class C felonies, battery as a Class D felony, and resisting law enforcement (RLE) as a Class D felony, and which sentenced him to a total executed term of 15 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While being booked for public intoxication, defendant struck police officers in an attempt to escape. Despite psychological testing, he was deemed competent to stand trial. Evidence of an insanity defense was precluded because defendant did not timely submit a written notice of his intent to use the defense. On appeal, defendant argued evidence of his mental illness was improperly excluded, his convictions violated double jeopardy, and he was improperly sentenced. The court found that defendant never made a showing of good cause, as required by Ind. Code &sect; 35-36-2-1, to justify his belated, oral motion to assert the insanity defense, so such evidence was properly excluded. However, since the jury likely used the same evidence to convict defendant of RLE on each of the batteries, and since the same injuries were used to enhance the attempted escape and battery convictions to felonies, double jeopardy under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, was implicated. Finally, defendant's well-documented and long-standing significant mental illness was a factor that warranted mitigating weight. A reduction of his sentence was appropriate under Ind. R. App. P. 7(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded with instructions to vacate the resisting law enforcement conviction and to reduce the battery convictions to Class A misdemeanors. The court further instructed that defendant be resentenced to the presumptive sentences on each conviction, to run concurrently, for a total term of 10 years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff casino sued defendant debtor, seeking to recover money for credit extended to the debtor. The complaint sought actual damages in addition to treble damages pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 34-24-3-1. The Clark Circuit Court (Indiana) entered summary judgment in favor of the casino. The debtor appealed and the casino cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The casino sought to collect $ 25,000 in credit it had extended to the debtor. The debtor wrote 10 checks, each in the amount of $ 2,500, to repay the casino, but the checks were returned when presented for payment, noting that there were not sufficient funds to cover the checks. The trial court's judgment awarded actual damages, attorneys fees, and costs to the casino, but not treble damages. The debtor argued that Ind. Code &sect; 34-16-1-1 (1998) prohibited the casino's action to collect the money it loaned to him. The appellate court disagreed. While Ind. Code &sect; 4-33-9-15 (Supp. 2004) did not explicitly refer to Ind. Code &sect; 34-16-1-1 (1998), it effectively created an exception for riverboat casino debts incurred legally pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 4-33-9-15 (Supp. 2004). Summary judgment in favor of the casino was proper. The decision to award damages in excess of actual damages pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 34-24-3-1 rested within the discretion of the trial court and there was no absolute entitlement to an award of treble damages. The casino was incorrect in arguing that it was entitled to treble damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) of dealing in cocaine as a class A felony and resisting law enforcement. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison. He appealed his convictions and sentence. The State cross-appealed the trial court's failure to enter a judgment of conviction on the jury's guilty verdict for one count of possession of cocaine and a firearm, a class C felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to sever his trial from his brother's. The appellate court held his brother's testimony implicating him did not require two trials nor was defendant prejudiced as the brother could testify in a separate trial. No prima facie Batson violation was shown as the State left two African-Americans in the jury pool. A tip on drug manufacturing at defendant's home and the fact the home's occupants ran, instead of answering the door, when officers knocked, let an officer follow an unobstructed walk to the house's rear, and, when there, his observation, through an uncovered window, of a co-defendant discarding apparent cocaine was admissible. This provided exigent circumstances as to imminent evidence destruction, allowing immediate warrantless entry. A suppression ruling was permissibly modified before final judgment. The amount of cocaine and defendant's history allowed an enhanced 40-year sentence. Under statutory construction rules and common law, and not double jeopardy, defendant's possession of cocaine and a firearm conviction was properly vacated due to a conviction for dealing the same cocaine as the firearm crime was necessarily included in the dealing crime.</SPAN></P>

Both parties agreed that the university was a governmental entity, but they disagreed whether the university was &quot;subject to&quot; the ADEA.

Both parties agreed that the Eleventh Amendment shielded the university, an instrumentality of the state, from private actions for monetary damages under the ADEA.

In affirming, the court determined that the statute of repose generally barred any suit brought more than ten years after the delivery of a product to the initial user or consumer. A claim under the PLA only accrued at the point where a physician who was reasonably experienced in making such a determination could have diagnosed an asbestos-related illness or disease. The evidence showed that the decedents were asymtomatic during the ten year period. As such, no reasonable physician would have performed invasive tests to see if the decedents were afflicted with the disease. The requirement of a manifested absestos-related disease or illness referred to a disease that could have been detected during a routine examination. Finally, the court determined that Ind.

The trial court dismissed the mother's cause of action, because case law precedent had established that Indiana did not recognize a wrongful death claim for the death of an unborn child. The court agreed that Ind. Code &sect; 34-23-2-1 did not provide relief for the death of an unborn fetus. The court strongly disagreed with the case law precedent and asserted that such precedent did not accurately interpret the term &quot;child&quot; under &sect; 34-23-2-1. The court urged the Indiana Supreme Court to reconsider its prior case law decision to support a conclusion that the Indiana legislature intended to permit recovery not only for the death of children born alive but also for the death of viable unborn children. Within its holding addressing the inappropriateness of the case law precedent, the court held that &sect; 34-23-2-1 violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 in that it discriminated against parents of children born alive and parents whose children were born dead. The court found no inherent difference between the two categories.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an investigation, the state labor department sent written notice to the employees informing them that, pursuant to the Indiana Common Construction Wage Act, Ind. Code &sect; 5-16-7-1 et seq. (CCWA), they had been underpaid for the work that they had performed while employed by the employer on three specific public works projects. In response, the employees filed suit against the employer seeking unpaid wages and related relief pursuant to the CCWA. The trial granted the employer's summary judgment motion after concluding that the employees' CCWA claims were preempted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1001 et seq. (ERISA). On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court erred in finding that ERISA preempted the CCWA. It so concluded because it found that ERISA was concerned with the administration of employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, while the CCWA involved wage payments to employees working on public works projects. As a result, the appellate court found that ERISA did not preempt the CCWA in the present case because the employees' wage claims were not &quot;connected with&quot; nor did they &quot;refer to&quot; ERISA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Grant Superior Court (Indiana) for sexual misconduct with a minor. He also contested his sentence of 20 years. Defendant argued that he should not have had the burden to prove the defense that he reasonably believed that his victim was older than 15; that his sentencing enhancement violated the Sixth Amendment; and that the trial court should not have rejected a proffered mitigator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, age 13, was picked up by defendant, age 27, while hitchhiking to a middle school. Defendant convinced her to go to his house, watched a pornographic videotape with the victim, and eventually convinced her to have sexual intercourse with him. Defendant had sexual intercourse on a subsequent occasion after the victim turned 14. The appellate court held the trial court's instruction was a correct statement of law because the mistaken belief defense in Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-9 did not negate an element of the crime. If believed, the defense only reduced defendant's culpability for acts he admitted that he committed. Defendant's knowledge of the victim's age was not an element of the crime. The trial court noted that defendant had five prior criminal convictions. Those convictions had already been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and were exempt from the Apprendi rule. That aggravator was sufficient to justify a sentence enhancement. The invalidity of any other aggravator had no effect on defendant's ultimate sentence. Thus, there was no Sixth Amendment violation. Defendant's proffered mitigator of facilitation was inapplicable as she could not consent to sexual contact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) of attempted murder, a Class A felony pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-5-1 ( 2004) and Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-1-1 (2004). The trial court imposed a 40-year sentence upon his conviction. Defendant appealed the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-4 (2004) provided that a person who committed a Class A felony would be imprisoned for a fixed term of 30 years, with not more than 20 years added for aggravating circumstances or not more than 10 years subtracted for mitigating circumstances. In its sentencing statement, the trial court stated that probably the most significant aggravating factor was defendant's planning and preparation of the attack. Defendant asserted that in convicting him of attempted murder, the jury was required to find only that he attacked his victim with the specific intent to kill. Defendant thus argued that the degree of planning and preparation was a fact not found by the jury and, therefore, could not have been considered by the court as justification for imposing an enhanced sentence. On appeal, the court found that the facts of planning and preparation need not have been found by the jury for the jury to have found defendant guilty of attempted murder. Thus, under the Sixth Amendment, the trial court could not itself make the finding of planning and preparation and then rely upon such in sentencing defendant to an enhanced term of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the cause was remanded to the trial court with instructions to either convene a jury for sentencing purposes or impose the presumptive sentence of 30 years for defendant's attempted murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was stopped for a traffic infraction after she left a suspected drug house. Marijuana and money were found in her car and an apparent drug ledger was found in her house. She pled guilty to one count of dealing drugs. The State's forfeiture complaints for the money and the car resulted in forfeiture of only the car. On appeal, the owner argued that insufficient evidence supported the forfeiture and that Ind. Code &sect; 34-24-1-1 was unconstitutional for various reasons, including double jeopardy under U.S. Const. amend. V and as an excessive fine under U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The guilty plea was reliable evidence to show that the owner transported drugs for dealing, so forfeiture of the car was authorized by Ind. Code &sect; 34-24-1-1(a)(1). Double jeopardy was not violated because the statute was civil. The value of the car was not grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense, so the forfeiture was not excessive. The remaining challenges under the takings clause, the bill of attainder clause, the common schools fund clause of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 3, and 7, and the free administration of justice clause under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, were waived and lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor performed gall bladder surgery on the patient. She experienced problems and returned to the hospital three days later. Three days thereafter, a test revealed that she had a bile duct injury. She sought follow-up care at another hospital. Six months after the surgery, the patient and her spouse hired an attorney to pursue a medical malpractice claim. The attorney sent a letter to the doctor indicating that it was believed that the doctor had deviated from the standard of care. However, the patient and spouse did not filed a complaint with the trial court until more than one-month beyond the two-year anniversary of the surgery date. They filed a proposed complaint with the Indiana Department of Insurance the next day. The trial court denied the doctor's motion for summary judgment, alleging the complaint and proposed complaint were barred by the two-year statute of limitations. On appeal, the appellate court found that the patient and spouse's complaints were time-barred because they had a reasonable amount of time of at least 14 months, if not longer, in which to file their complaints from the time they should have discovered they had a medical malpractice claim.</SPAN></P>

A single board member found that the application for adjustment of claim to reflect the silicosis was barred by Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-7-9(f)(1), which placed a three-year limit on silicosis claims, as the worker's disablement did not occur within three years after the last day of the last exposure to the silica dust. The wife argued that Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-7-9(f)(1) violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, because it granted unequal privileges and immunities to the broad class of individuals who suffered from occupational diseases. The appellate court held that the inherent distinctions between individuals who suffered from the various types of occupational diseases justified the disparate treatment accorded to them in Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-7-9(f). The appellate court further held that Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-7-9 was not unconstitutional as applied, because the preferential treatment afforded under Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-7-9(f)(1) was uniformly applicable and equally available to all persons similarly situated.</SPAN></P>
