</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed: (1) the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was involved in any of the offenses due to deficiencies in the witnesses' identifications; (2) his sentence for aggravated kidnapping violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970)); and (3) his sentence for aggravated kidnapping should be vacated. The appeals court found a rational trier of fact could have found defendant guilty of intimidation, home invasion, armed robbery and aggravated kidnapping beyond a reasonable doubt, as the witnesses had ample opportunity to view him during the crime. The State conceded the 15-year enhancement on his sentence for aggravated kidnapping violated the proportionate penalties clause and was therefore unconstitutional. Due to the enhancement, the sentencing range for aggravated kidnapping was greater than the sentencing range for the similar offense of armed violence predicated on kidnapping. Following Gibson, the appeals court found the trial court had the opportunity to view and weigh the significance of all the evidence and thus was in a better position to impose a sentence for aggravated kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for intimidation, home invasion, armed robbery, and aggravated kidnapping were affirmed. The sentence for aggravated kidnapping was vacated, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for resentencing on the conviction for aggravated kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) convicting him of two counts of workers' compensation fraud under 820 ILCS 305/25.5(a) (2006), sentencing him to 24 months' probation, and ordering him to pay $ 22, 594 in restitution to the administrator of workers' compensation benefits for defendant's employer to reimburse it for the costs of investigating defendant's workers' compensation claim and its attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction under count I because nothing in his initial application for workers' compensation benefits or the 820 ILCS 305/19(b) (2006) petition required him to state whether he was totally disabled from working, and therefore his failure to disclose his temporary light-duty work did not render his workers' compensation claim false or fraudulent. However, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction under count II because the evidence showed that defendant consistently represented to his treating physician that his level of pain was a nine or ten, leading the physician to conclude that he 85 percent or more disabled but contrary to those representations, defendant had been working light duty at two construction sites for 27 days. The court held that 820 ILCS 305/25.5 was not unconstitutionally vague because the terms &quot;false or fraudulent&quot; and &quot;material representation&quot; were within the daily vocabulary of ordinary people and therefore did not have to be defined in the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction on count II was affirmed, but his conviction on count I was reversed. The order of restitution was reduced to $ 12,923. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered final judgments of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of two aggravated criminal sexual assault counts and one criminal sexual abuse count. On appeal, he primarily challenged the constitutionality of that part of the Illinois Juvenile Court Act of 1987 directing automatic transfer of a juvenile age 15 or over to adult criminal court based on being charged with certain Class X felonies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly sexually assaulted the young victim over more than a one-year time period at the place where he resided. Pursuant to the automatic transfer provision of the Illinois Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 ILCS 405/5-130 et seq. (2006) (Juvenile Court Act), his case proceeded in criminal court because he was statutorily excluded from the jurisdiction of juvenile court for being at least 15-years-old and accused of aggravated criminal sexual assault. A jury found him guilty on two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and one count of criminal sexual abuse. On appeal, he primarily claimed that the automatic transfer provision was unconstitutional. He also challenged evidentiary rulings and the sufficiency of the evidence. The appellate court found that the automatic transfer provision violated neither his substantive nor procedural due process rights since it was rationally related to handling specific violent crimes by young offenders and only applied to 15-year-olds and 16-year-olds who committed them. It also found that he did not show reversible error regarding the evidentiary rulings or that the evidence was insufficient to support the guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a final judgment of conviction after it found defendant guilty of unlawful use of a weapon in violation of 720 ILCS 5/24-1.1 (2008) and sentenced him to serve three years in the Illinois Department of Corrections, with a recommendation for boot camp. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after a bench trial of unlawful use of a weapon in violation of 720 ILCS 5/24-1.1 (2008). After sentencing, he claimed on appeal that the State had not proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that 720 ILCS 5/24-1.1 (2008) violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The appellate court found that a rational trier of fact could have found that he constructively possessed the revolver and ammunition recovered at the time police searched his residence and that the State had proven the essential elements of that offense, committed by a felon, beyond a reasonable doubt. As to the constitutional claim, it first found that he could raise that claim on appeal because a constitutional challenge to a statute could be raised at anytime. It also found an intermediate level of scrutiny applied, which meant that the challenged statutory provision had to serve a significant, substantial, or important governmental interest, and the fit between the challenged law and the asserted objective had to be reasonable. It then found that under that test, the statute was constitutional because defendant as a convicted felon was not protected by the Second Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) of two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and sentenced to the statutory minimum of 32 years in prison.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the mandatory consecutive sentencing statute,&nbsp;730 ILCS 5/5-8-4, was unconstitutional as applied to him and violated Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court of appeals disagreed. The trial court duly noted the substantial testimony at sentencing that defendant was a good person and that the crime was out of character for him. The trial court went on, however, to note reports of defendant's poor behavior while incarcerated. First, defendant was expelled from a GED class for his poor efforts and horseplay. Second, defendant was placed in isolation for using vulgar language toward staff, making sexually explicit comments to a therapist, and being noncompliant. The court inferred from those reports that defendant was indeed capable of acting &quot;outside of his character.&quot; The sex offender evaluator found that defendant was at a &quot;moderate&quot; risk to reoffend, based on his young age and other factors, including potential for psychopathy and unrealistic plans and negative attitude toward intervention. At the time of sentencing, defendant had taken few steps that showed definite rehabilitative potential.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Clinton County, Illinois, granted the motion filed by appellant company to certify a question for interlocutory appeal pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 308, in the proceeding with appellee city. The certified question was whether a non-home-rule unit had the authority to prohibit or bar the drilling or operation of an oil or gas well within its municipal limits?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was a non-home-rule unit of government. The company entered into an oil and gas lease with the owners of the mineral interests in a 67-acre parcel of land. The company argued that the city had the limited authority to regulate the drilling or operation of an oil or gas well within its municipal limits, but it was not authorized to bar or prohibit such activity. The company claimed that as a non-home-rule unit of government, the city lacked the authority to prohibit the drilling or operation of an oil or gas well within its municipal limits. The appellate court ruled that a non-home-rule unit of government could prohibit the drilling or operation of an oil or gas well within its municipal limits. 225 ILCS 725/13 provided a city the power to prohibit the operation of an oil or gas well within its municipal limits. 65 ILCS 5/11-56-1 (2004) provided local units of government the power to regulate and permit local oil and gas mining. Pursuant to 225 ILCS 725/13, a municipality could block the Illinois Department of Natural Resources' issuance of a permit to operate an oil or gas well within its municipal limits.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the UUW statute did not, on its face, violate the Second Amendment, and the UUW statute did not require the State to show any improper purpose for the felon's possession of a firearm. Because the UUW statute constituted a valid exercise of the government's right to protect the health, safety and general welfare of its citizens, the UUW statute was a constitutionally permissible restriction of the Second Amendment right to bear arms. The restriction served a substantial governmental interest and was proportional to the interest served. There was a longstanding prohibition on the possession of firearms by felons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated one of defendant's two convictions for AUUW under the one act, one crime rule because both convictions were based on the same, single act of possession of the same revolver. The court held that defense counsel was not ineffective for allegedly eliciting testimony that suggested that the offense was gang-related because counsel's challenged actions were reasonable and consistent with the strategy to discredit the testimony of the State's witnesses that the officers saw defendant in the street carrying the gun. The court held that 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6(a)(1), (a)(3)(C) was constitutional under the Second Amendment because, under intermediate scrutiny, the fit between the statute and its substantial and important goal of reducing the armed violence and illegal activity of street gangs, was reasonable. The statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it did not burden a fundamental right, as it did not impinge on conduct at the core of the Second Amendment right. Defendant cited no case law showing that he had a fundamental right to carry on or about his person a handgun when he was not on his own land or in his abode or fixed place of business.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he argued that: (1) the State did not prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of aggravated discharge of a firearm; (2) the trial court failed to timely conduct an EJJ hearing; and (3) the EJJ statue was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court found that the State provided sufficient evidence to prove the juvenile guilty of 720 ILCS 5/24-1.2(a)(3) (2008) aggravated discharge of a firearm, that 705 ILCS 405/5-810(2) (2008) regarding the time for holding an EJJ hearing was directory, not mandatory, and that he lacked standing to challenge 705 ILCS 405/5-810(6) (2008)'s constitutionality regarding imposition of adult sentences, as he had not yet been affected by that statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of two counts of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and six counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon (AUUW). At sentencing, all counts were merged into one AUUW conviction and defendant was sentenced to five years in prison, with 308 days' credit for the time he served awaiting trial. Defendant was also assessed costs totaling $715. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found to be in possession of a handgun and ammunition while standing on a public street, thus negating any possible application of the holding concerning possession of handguns in the home. Because 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6(a)(1), (a)(3)(A) (2008) of the AUUW statute applied to the situation in which defendant found himself, being in a public place with a handgun, he could not argue for relief based on the possibility that the AUUW might be unconstitutional as applied to a felon in possession of a handgun in his own home. Judgments of conviction were entered for defendant, and the fact that those convictions were not among those enumerated by 55 ILCS 5/5-1103 (2008) for imposition of a court services fee of $25 without entry of conviction did not void the assessment. Further, because 730 ILCS 5/5-4-3 mandated that a convicted felon submit a DNA sample and pay the analysis fee, the appellate court presumed the circuit court followed the law and assessed the fee on defendant as part of either of the sentences imposed on his prior felony convictions and that fee was not imposed again in the current case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, vacated the judgment in part, and remanded the case with directions to modify the mittimus to accord with the findings regarding the imposition of certain costs and the application of pretrial incarceration credit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff debtor filed a class action against defendants, a bank and its successor-in-interest (collectively, the lender), alleging, inter alia, violations of the Illinois Interest Act (Interest Act), 815 ILCS 205/1 et seq. (2010), and the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Practices Act (Consumer Fraud Act), 815 ILCS 505/1 et seq. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted the lender's motion to dismiss with prejudice. The debtor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor, a limited liability company and an individual, obtained a loan from the lender. The promissory note identified the 365/360 method as the applicable method for computing interest. A dispute arose out of the lender's use of the 365/360 method. The debtor claimed that interest had to be calculated pursuant to 815 ILCS 205/4, 9, and 10 of the Interest Act. However, 815 ILCS 205/4 did not apply to corporations and 815 ILCS 205/9 and 10 were gap-filling provisions that only applied when no time period for calculation of interest appeared anywhere in the instrument in question. Furthermore, there was no action under the Consumer Fraud Act because the terms used in the note were clearly unambiguous and nothing in the record indicated deception. Therefore, in the light most favorable to the debtor, the allegations of the complaint were insufficient to state a cause of action upon which relief could have been granted, and the trial court correctly granted the lender's motion to dismiss with prejudice, pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-615 (2010).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by denying the property owner's petition for substitution of the judge because he could not establish a violation of 735 ILCS 5/2-1001 (2008) as the petition was premised upon the trial court's handling of his written specification of errors and defendants' written response thereto. In addition, the property owner was not prejudiced, as his petition contained no assertions of any extrajudicial source of bias or prejudice. The court rejected the property owner's contention that the administrative proceedings were void under 65 ILCS 5/1-2.1-4(d) (2008) because he did not challenge the fact that both he and the administrative law officer had copies of the notice of ordinance violation at the administrative hearing, a copy of the notice had been properly served on the property owner, and a copy of the document appeared in the administrative record. The court rejected the property owner's claim that he did not receive proper notice of the administrative proceeding against him under Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 2-14-074(b) because it contained all of the information necessary to determine the issuing officer's identity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Du Page County, Illinois, which sentenced him to five years of imprisonment after a conviction for forgery under 720 ILCS 5/17-3(a)(2) (2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that imposing probation in this case would have depreciated the seriousness of the offense, so a five year prison term was imposed under 730 ILCS 5/5-6-1(a) (2008). Defendant then sought review, arguing that this violated the decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey. In affirming, the appellate court determined that, since defendant was found guilty of a Class 3 felony, an appropriate sentence included a term of imprisonment, which could not have exceeded five years. Therefore, although the sentence in this case was the maximum, it was still appropriate for a Class 3 felony. There was nothing suggesting that probation was the maximum sentence. Deciding whether probation or imprisonment was appropriate for defendant after considering the circumstances of the offense and defendant's individual characteristics was the type of decision that judges routinely made in sentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, that convicted him of first-degree murder, arguing that the automatic transfer statute,&nbsp;705 ILCS 405/5-130 (2008), violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII, that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense, and that his counsel was ineffective in failing to request a jury instruction on the lesser offense of involuntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the automatic transfer statute,&nbsp;705 ILCS 405/5-130 (2008), which required that 15- and 16-year-old defendants charged with first-degree murder be prosecuted in adult court and not juvenile court, did not violate the Eighth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII, because it did not impose any penalty but merely provided the forum where guilt would be adjudicated. The trial court did not err in failing to instruct on self-defense because defendant never admitted killing the victim and failed to present evidence that he reasonably believed deadly force was necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself. Where defendant denied using any force against the victim, he could not claim to have acted in self-defense. Further counsel did not err in failing to request an involuntary manslaughter instruction. The State presented evidence that defendant intentionally killed the victim by a shot to the back of the head, defendant denied shooting and killing the victim, but there was no evidence that defendant recklessly killed the victim. In the absence of evidence of recklessness, defendant was not entitled to an involuntary manslaughter instruction.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that: (1) defendant's aggregated 97-year sentence on his 16 felony convictions was not a de facto life sentence without parole; (2) any preindictment delay had no effect on his due process or speedy-trial rights; (3) collateral estoppel barred reconsideration of the ineffective assistance argument; and (4) he did not show the criminal offense or the disciplinary proceedings inadequately informed him as to the offense he committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a 15-year-old juvenile, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, that adjudicated him delinquent for having committed aggravated unlawful use of a weapon under 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6(a) (2008), arguing that the aggravated unlawful use of a weapon statute, which criminalized the possession of a loaded, uncased, and accessible firearm outside the home, violated his constitutional right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile asserted a facial challenge to the aggravated unlawful use of a weapon statute, contending that it violated his constitutional right to bear arms. Noting that it had considered this identical argument on several occasions and found that the statute constitutional, the court applied the intermediate scrutiny analysis and again determined that the statute survived a constitutional challenge. Specifically, the statute served an important governmental objective; its overall purpose was to protect the public and police enforcement officers from the inherent dangers or threats to safety posed by any person carrying in public a loaded and accessible firearm on his person or in his vehicle. Further, the means employed were substantially related to the objective. The statute did not impose a blanket prohibition on carrying firearms outside of the home but was limited to prevent the carrying of loaded, uncased, and accessible firearms in public on the street. The prohibition was justified by the potential deadly consequences to innocent members of the general public when someone carrying a loaded and accessible gun was mistaken about his need for defense or was just a poor shot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to charges of first-degree murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and home invasion. Pursuant to a guilty plea, he was convicted of first degree murder, home invasion, and aggravated criminal sexual assault. He received concurrent sentences of 50 years, 30 years, and 30 years. A mittimus was eventually issued reflecting a sentence of 50 years for the murder and 30 years for the home invasion. The trial court then dismissed his pro se motion for relief from judgment that he filed and in which he challenged various aspects of his guilty plea rather than his concurrent sentencing. On appeal, he challenged the concurrent sentences as being void. The appellate court found that since he was challenging the sentences as being void, under the law he could raise that challenge at any time. It also found that an aggravated criminal sexual assault conviction under 720 ILCS 5/12-14 (1998) triggered mandatory consecutive sentences due to defendant's convictions on multiple offenses regardless of whether a single course of conduct or multiple courses of conduct were involved, and resentencing had to be within the plea agreement and the relevant, applicable statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) that dismissed their action against defendants, education superintendent, board of education, and governor, in which they sought a declaration that the Illinois education funding system found in 105 ILCS 5/18-8.05 (2010) in violation of the equal-protection clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers claimed the state's education funding system had the effect of requiring taxpayers in school districts with low property values to pay property taxes to fund local public schools at a higher rate than similarly situated taxpayers--that is, taxpayers owning similarly valued real property--in school districts with high property values, which violated &sect; 2. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the state neither rewarded nor punished the taxpayers' school districts for exceeding the statutory tax rates on which the state based its aid calculation. Any injury incurred by higher tax rates could not be fairly traceable to defendants' actions. Moreover, a declaration that the state's funding scheme was unconstitutional would not redress the taxpayers' claimed injury. Therefore, the taxpayers did not allege an actual or threatened injury. Since their claim of higher tax rates could not be fairly traceable to the defendants' actions, they lacked standing to challenge &sect; 18-8.05. Consequently, the trial court did not err in granting the defendants' motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, the Circuit Court of Woodford County (Illinois) convicted defendant of predatory criminal sexual assault 720 ILCS 5/12-14.1(a)(1) (2006). He was sentenced to 12 years in prison. The judgment was affirmed on appeal. Based on a supervisory opinion from the Illinois Supreme Court, the appeal was reopened.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that 725 ILCS 5/115-10 (2006) was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the reliability requirement in 725 ILCS 5/115-10(b)(1) did not affect the constitutionality of the statute because hearsay testimony still had to satisfy Crawford's constitutional requirements, in addition to the statutory requirement of reliability. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the video recording of the interview between the officer and the victim pursuant to 25 ILCS 5/115-10 because the officer did not direct the child victim's answers in the interview. He asked open-ended questions, which she answered. She described conduct with which a typical four- or five-year-old child would not and should not be familiar. Not only did she describe what defendant did, she also described how it felt. Finally, because the victim was available for cross-examination, trial counsel's performance was not deficient for failing to argue that the victim's testimony at trial made her unavailable as a witness. She was present and she answered all of the questions posed by defense counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. He remained in custody throughout the proceedings. He requested and was granted several continuances, tolling the running of the speedy trial period. Six days before trial was scheduled to begin, the State sought a continuance and an extension of the speedy trial period pursuant to 725 ILCS 5/103-5(c) (2010). The State's motion was granted over defendant's objection, and the trial was rescheduled. Thereafter, the State filed a second motion for continuance under 735 ILCS 5/103-5(c) (2010) to procure the presence of a witness at trial. Defendant objected, but the motion was granted. A different judge then concluded that defendant's speedy trial right had been violated by granting the second continuance because the trial was set outside the speedy trial period. Accordingly, the charge was dismissed and defendant was dismissed from state custody. The appellate court found that dismissal of the charge and discharge was appropriate because 725 ILCS 5/103-5(c) (2010) permitted only one 60-day continuance and the State had other options for trying defendant if it wanted to do so, but it did not use any of those options.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of McLean County, Illinois, which accepted a guilty plea to unlawful possession of more than 5,000 grams of cannabis with intent to deliver, in violation of 720 ILCS 550/5(g) (2008), a Class X felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to declare 720 ILCS 550/5(g)&nbsp;unconstitutional based on scientific studies relating to cannabis. After defendant was sentenced to 12 years in prison, his motion for reconsideration was denied. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that, even though Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 placed some restraint on the right of the Illinois Legislature to establish penalties for crimes, courts were reluctant to invalidate penalties prescribed by the Legislature. Defendant failed to show that punishing him as a Class X offender by imposing a 12-year prison term was cruel, degrading, or so wholly disproportionate to the offense that it shocked the moral sense of the community. The sentence was not excessive since this was defendant's third drug-related conviction, and the sentence was at the lower end of the potential range. Defendant failed to show an equal protection violation based on the scientific studies, which were more properly given to the Illinois Legislature. There was a rational basis for classifying the crime based on the Legislature's stated and unchanged purpose in enacting the Illinois Cannabis Control Act, 720 ILCS 550/1 (2008).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 10th Judicial Circuit Court, Peoria County (Illinois), granted the State's motion to transfer defendant's case of armed robbery from the juvenile court to the criminal court for trial as an adult. After a bench trial, defendant was convicted of the armed robbery charge. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was 13-years-old, was arrested after committing an armed robbery of a bank with an unloaded handgun. Initially, he was charged by juvenile petition. The State then moved to transfer the case from juvenile court to criminal court for him to be tried as an adult. The juvenile court considered the factors under the discretionary transfer provision of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 ILCS 405/5-805(3)(b) (2008), and after orally pronouncing findings, granted the State's motion to transfer. Defendant was then convicted of armed robbery following a bench trial and was sentenced. The appellate court found that the juvenile court failed to adequately address certain factors. First, it found that no evidence was presented as to the availability and advantages of treatment services in the juvenile system, which was one statutory factor. Also, it determined that the evidence presented at the transfer hearing failed to establish that defendant possessed a deadly weapon, another statutory factor. Too, it found that the juvenile court failed to consider the nonstatutory element of his potential sentence as an adult. As a result, it found the transfer order had to be vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the judgment of conviction, vacated the decision to transfer defendant's case to the criminal court to be tried as an adult, and remanded the case to the juvenile court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The victim testified defendant inserted his penis into her vagina two or three times a week for three years, starting when she was 10 years old, and that defendant threatened to hurt her mother if she ever told anyone what he had done. The victim testified to how defendant inserted his penis into her anus after he discovered she had been writing about the incidents in her diary. The victim testified defendant caused her pain when he rubbed her vaginal area with baby oil prior to the first time he inserted his penis into her vagina, and she also testified he caused her pain when he inserted his penis into her anus. Defendant's repeated sexual assaults of the victim physically harmed her and caused both her and her family severe emotional harm. Further, other victims similarly testified that when defendant was dating their mother he sexually assaulted them for approximately two years, beginning when they were 14 years old and 8 years old.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an underlying divorce action involving the mother, father, and son, visitation and other issues not addressed by the dissolution judgment remained open. In connection with those issues, the trial court appointed the child representative for the son. The child representative remained in that capacity until the dissolution of marriage action was fully adjudicated and became final. Thereafter, the mother filed a three-count complaint against the child representative and his law firm, alleging legal malpractice, intentional breach of fiduciary duty and intentional interference with her custody rights, all related to his representation of the son in the underlying divorce proceeding. The trial court granted the child representative and law firm's 735 ILCS 5/2-619 (2010) motion to dismiss upon finding that they were absolutely immune for his work performed as a child representative in that case. The appellate court found that the child representative had absolute immunity under 750 ILCS 5/506(a) (2010) for work performed within his court-appointed duties. It also found that the law firm as a principal could not be liable since the agent, the child representative, was not liable.</SPAN></P>

The Board issued a written decision that affirmed the recommendation. Although the prospective candidate timely mailed his petition for review of the Board's decision, his petition violated 10 ILCS 5/10-10.1 (2010) because it was not sent registered or certified mail and it was mailed to the relevant parties' attorneys rather than, as that section required, the parties themselves. Although he tried to correct the problems by properly serving the parties, the service was beyond that statute's time limits. The trial court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The appellate court then found that because the trial court lacked jurisdiction due to his noncompliance with the Illinois Election Code, it lacked jurisdiction to hear his appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a murder case in which defendant was charged with murdering his estranged third wife in 2004 after his fourth wife disappeared in 2007, the circuit court did not err in precluding the State's expert witness from testifying what the judge in the divorce case would have ultimately ruled at the marital property distribution proceeding had the victim lived or what defendant's attorney in the divorce case would have advised him to expect to occur because experts were not permitted to testify as to statutory interpretation or legal conclusion and were not permitted to offer testimony that was based upon speculation or conjecture. Further, the circuit court did not err in precluding defendant's son from his first marriage, the victim's sister, and defendant's second wife from testifying about instances of domestic violence to show defendant's propensity to commit such crimes because the evidence was too remote in time; although the prior incidents shared some factual similarities to the charged conduct and were arguably relevant to show motive, intent, and propensity, all of the incidents occurred many years before the charged offense, some as many as 22 years earlier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss was granted as to those issues for which the State's notice of appeal was untimely filed under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(a)(1). As to the remaining issues, the circuit court's rulings on the admissibility of the evidence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of armed robbery while armed with a firearm and two counts of aggravated kidnaping while armed with a firearm. The trial court sentenced defendant to 20 years' imprisonment for armed robbery and 20 years for aggravated kidnaping, to run concurrently. After defendant's motion for postconviction relief was summarily dismissed, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his sentences violated the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court of appeals disagreed. The trial court declined to impose the 15-year add-on penalty to either of defendant's sentences, and his 20-year sentences were, therefore, proper. However, the trial court stated that the reason why it declined to add the 15-year enhancement was that the State did not give proper notice to defendant that it would seek the enhancement, and not that it had any doubts as to whether the add-on penalty was valid. Accordingly, while the sentence imposed by the trial court was proper, the appropriate remedy was to remand for sentencing in accordance with the statute as it existed before it was amended, in order to allow the trial court to determine defendant's sentence for each offense while taking into account the totality of his sentence. However, since the truth-in-sentencing provision under 730 ILCS 5/3-6-3 did not affect the sentencing range imposed for the offenses of aggravated kidnaping and armed violence, but only the manner in which the sentence was carried out, it did not violate the proportionate penalties clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded for resentencing. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, alleging that appellees, the warden, the acting warden, and the Director of the Department of Corrections (DOC), acted unlawfully by depriving him of certain property, exercise privileges, and administrative action. The Circuit Court of Livingston County (Illinois) dismissed the inmate's petition. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that the trial court erred by dismissing his mandamus petition. The appellate court held that the petition for a writ of mandamus was properly dismissed under 735 ILCS 5/2-615 (2008) because the inmate did not have a &quot;right&quot; to access the prison's exercise yard. Also, Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, &sect; 504.670 gave appellees the discretionary authority to place restrictions on the inmate's exercise-yard privileges. The inmate claimed only that his access to the yard was restricted whenever he received an inmate disciplinary report (IDR). Without more, his claim failed to set forth every material fact required to demonstrate that he is entitled to mandamus relief. Further, the DOC director could delegate the review of the inmate's grievance appeal because he was not required to personally review such appeals. And, the inmate did not allege material facts relating to the &quot;legal and personal property&quot; at issue, nor the circumstances under which appellees purportedly confiscated that property. Prison officials could establish regulations regarding the property inmates could retain in their cells. Finally, he did not have a constitutional right to the appointment of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pled guilty to one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, he moved to vacate that plea. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, he contended his plea was void because, before he entered it, the State had nol-prossed that charge. He also argued that his plea was not voluntary because he had not been informed it could be the basis for filing a petition to have him civilly committed as a sexually violent person. The appellate court rejected both claims. It noted the State had nol-prossed the charge, but found that the trial court had reacquired jurisdiction over it through the doctrine of revestment because he and the State participated in later proceedings regarding the charge that were inconsistent with that disposition, and without objection. As to plea voluntariness, the appellate court found the petition that the State filed to have him declared to be a sexually violent person was a collateral consequence that the trial court did not have to admonish him about before accepting his plea. It also added that it would not apply the United State Supreme Court's recent Padilla decision regarding deportation to the civil commitment context before it.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he contended that (1) the trial court violated Ill. Sup. Ct.

The appellate court found that he was not entitled to plain-error review relief, as even though the trial court erred in instructing the jurors under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 431(b), he did not show that a biased jury had been seated. It also found that the 15-year sentence enhancement violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution, meaning he had to be resentenced without that enhancement and that he waived the sentencing factor challenging by raising for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, which convicted him of possession of a controlled substance. Defendant contended that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him for violating a municipal ordinance prohibiting the solicitation of unlawful business, thereby requiring suppression of the heroin recovered in his postarrest search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in a high gang and narcotics area for yelling &quot;blows,&quot; in violation of Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 10-8-515, which prohibited the solicitation of unlawful business. He was taken to the police station, where a custodial search revealed seven packets of heroin. Contrary to defendant's argument, the court held that police did not lack probable cause to arrest him for violating the ordinance as the evidence showed that defendant solicited the sale of heroin on a public way in Chicago, thus allowing a conclusion that the officers witnessed defendant violate the ordinance and that they had probable cause to arrest defendant. While defendant argued that the word &quot;blows&quot; had meanings other than heroin, the existence of possible innocent explanations for the individual circumstances did not negate probable cause. The officer's belief that defendant was soliciting the sale of heroin was based on knowledge from 15 years' police service and hundreds of narcotics arrests that &quot;blows&quot; referred to the sale of heroin.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault and unlawful restraint for attacking his wife. In a separate case, he was also indicted for residential arson for setting fire to her house 13 days after the alleged attack on her. The first case proceeded to trial, and a jury convicted him of aggravated criminal sexual assault and unlawful restraint. After he was sentenced, the State dismissed the residential arson indictment. On appeal, the appellate court reversed defendant's convictions and remanded for a new trial. The State subsequently reindicted him for residential arson. He moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground of prosecutorial vindictiveness. The trial court held that the State did not meet its burden of establishing that it was not being vindictive; therefore, it granted his motion. The appellate court found that the State's decision to reindict him for residential arson after he had successfully appealed in a separate case his convictions of aggravated criminal sexual assault and unlawful restraint did not trigger a presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness. It then found that he did not prove that the State engaged in actual vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the trial court's error in failing to instruct the jury that the State had to prove a specific intent by defendant to injure her dog was not plain error because the evidence on that element was not closely balanced, as the jury could have found that defendant specifically intended to cause her dog injury at a point in time after the tow chain broke through the skin and during the four to six weeks it took for the chain to become seriously embedded in the dog's neck. The court could not find that delivering an agreed-to non-pattern jury instruction, when no such instruction was available and the given instruction tracked the statute, challenged the integrity of the judicial process. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in responding to the jury's note regarding whether defendant's failure to remove the chain could qualify as an &quot;act&quot; as the statute required because defendant's claimed distinction between an &quot;act&quot; and an &quot;omission&quot; had no legal basis in Illinois criminal law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 19-year-old youth, robbed the victim, who was a 17-year-old youth selling heroin in a public housing building. Later the same day, the victim went into a second building and saw defendant, who shot and gravely wounded the victim. Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of attempted first degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon (AUUW). He was sentenced to 45 years in prison on the attempted murder charge and had fees imposed against him. The appellate court found, inter alia, that (1) the trial court did not improperly assume the role of prosecutor by considering the the earlier robbery, as it only did so to assess the victim's ability to identify defendant regarding the current offenses; (2) his sentence for attempted murder was not excessive; (3) his convictions for aggravated battery with a firearm and one AUUW count violated the one-act, one-crime rule; (4) the AUUW statute,&nbsp;720 ILCS 5/24-1.6 (2004), did not violate the Second Amendment or Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 right to bear arms; and (5) a $ 50 court system fee could be permissibly imposed under 55 ILCS 5/5-1101(c) (2004).</SPAN></P>

It also affirmed imposition of a $ 50 court system fee, vacated the imposition of the other challenged fees totaling $ 160, and offset the fines totaling $ 15 with accrued presentence credit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, which convicted him of Class 4 possession of cocaine. Specifically, defendant challenged the denial of his motion to quash his arrest and suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed at a known narcotics sales spot yelling &quot;dro, dro&quot; at a passing vehicle. He was arrested for violating Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 10-8-515 (1998), which prohibited the solicitation of an unlawful business on a public way. A motion to quash the arrest and suppress evidence in a search incident to arrest was denied, and defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine. This appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court determined, had a complaint been filed against defendant based upon what was observed and heard at the time of the arrest, such a complaint charging solicitation of unlawful business in the language of Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 10-8-515 (1998) would have been insufficient under 725 ILCS 5/111-3(a) (2008) because the phrase &quot;unlawful business&quot; did not describe specific conduct. Moreover, the term &quot;dro&quot; did not qualify as a common term for cannabis such that a complaint defining the term would have satisfied the requirement that an ordinance violation be charged with reasonable certainty. The facts known in this case amounted to no more than reasonable suspicion under Terry, and probable cause did not exist to arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

It held that their equal protection and due process claims were barred by collateral estoppel, and that their privacy law claim had to be dismissed because federal privacy law would require dismissal. The appellate court found that their equal protection claim was not barred by collateral estoppel because the federal opinion was not decided on equal protection grounds, and that their due process claim was not barred by collateral estoppel because the federal court was presented with only a very narrow question not at issue in the present case. It also found state and federal constitutional clauses could be considered coextensive when the two clauses were worded the same, but that logic did not apply when the Illinois Constitution had an express clause, such as a right to privacy clause, which the federal constitution did not.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the child's mother testified that her daughter had ran away in March 2002, when she was  12-years old. In June 2002, defendant was observed with the child at a shopping mall. Defendant proclaimed to the police that the child was his cousin. The mother had reported the child missing, and testified she did not know defendant, she had not given him permission to care for her daughter, and he was not related to her or her daughter. Defendant argued that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutionally overbroad and criminalized constitutionally protected speech. The appellate court ruled that 720 ILCS 5/32-5.3 (2002) was not unconstitutionally overbroad. A construction of 720 ILCS 5/32-5.3 that required the false statement be given knowingly and with the intent of deceiving the relevant public official or employee advanced the State's interest in protecting minors, while limiting the punishment of speech to cases where a person knowingly deceives a public official or employee to frustrate the operations of government in the protection of minors. Also, defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) summarily dismissing her post-conviction petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before reaching the merits of defendant's case, the appellate court had to first determine whether defendant, who was convicted of a misdemeanor and received a disposition of supervision, had standing to proceed under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 ILCS 5/122-1 et seq., before the supervision was complete. The trial court placed defendant on supervision, which did not, as a matter of law, constitute a disposition following a judgment of conviction. As defendant had not yet received a judgment of conviction and sentence when she filed her petition under the Act, defendant's petition was premature. No exception existed to the rule that there had to be a final judgment to challenge under the Act. Also, defendant had another avenue available to raise her claims as Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(b) provided for a direct appeal. Further, the fact that defendant contended that there were serious collateral consequences that resulted from the entry of supervision in a criminal case did not change the fact that her petition was premature. Thus, the circuit court did not err in dismissing her post-conviction petition as premature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after a bench trial of attempted first degree murder of a peace officer, being an armed habitual criminal, and aggravated discharge of a firearm.

On appeal, he alleged the sentence enhancement was improper, his armed habitual criminal conviction was an ex post facto violation, his conviction for aggravated discharge of a firearm violated the one-act, one-crime rule, and his mittimus should be corrected. The appellate court found that: (1) allowing addition of a firearm enhancement to a sentence given pursuant to 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)(1)(A) (2006) addressed the legislature's desire both to deter intentional peace officer killings and to discourage the use of firearms in the commission of felonies; (2) the armed habitual criminal statute did not violate constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto legislation; (3) his convictions were not improperly based on a single physical act of firearm possession; and (4) his mittimus needed to be corrected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the trial of defendant, whose first name was Jesse, the State, in order to prove that defendant had a criminal record, introduced a certified copy of a 1997 conviction for unlawful use of a weapon by a felon for an individual with the same surname but with the first name of &quot;Jessie.&quot; Defendant did not object but challenged such evidence on appeal and contended that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the certified copy reflected his prior conviction rather than the conviction of an individual with a similar name. On review, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because the record indicated that defendant's criminal history report named defendant as &quot;Jessie&quot; and listed defendant's use of &quot;Jessie&quot; as an alias at least eight times between 1975 to 2002, as well as four convictions under the name &quot;Jessie.&quot; Further, the armed habitual criminal statute was a constitutionally permissible restriction of the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

In vacating, the appellate court first noted that the appeal was moot because the time period in the order had expired. However, the collateral consequences exception applied in this case because of the suspension of the patient's nursing licence and the necessity of seeking the reinstatement of that license. The State was put on notice that the patient was challenging her involuntary admission on the basis that she was reasonably expected to engage in dangerous conduct. Moreover, a posttrial motion was not required. Next, the involuntary admission was vacated as void because the trial court relied upon a standard that had been held to be unconstitutionally vague. The definition of dangerous conduct was unconstitutionally vague; because 405 ILCS 5/1-119(1), (3) (2008) required a finding that the patient was reasonably expected to engage in dangerous conduct as defined in the unconstitutional&nbsp;405 ILCS 5/1-104.5 (2008), the admission could not have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

To prove aggravated kidnapping as charged, the State only needed to prove the elements of kidnapping plus the commission of criminal sexual assault and the use of force or threat of force, but not aggravated criminal sexual assault. The seven-year sentences for each count fell within the statutory sentencing range of six to 30 years, and the imposition of the seven-year sentences as a consecutive sentence affected only the manner by which the sentence was carried out and did not constitute an increase in penalty.</SPAN></P>

When the LLC later filed its action challenging the TIF district, the trial court found it was barred by res judicata. The LLC contended that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because res judicata was inapplicable and inequitable in the instant cause. The appeals court disagreed. Each of the elements of res judicata had been met: the tenant brought a suit against the village to final adjudication, that suit clearly involved an identity of the same cause of action as the suit the LLC subsequently filed against the village, and the tenant and the LLC stood in privity with regard to the same set of operative facts. To allow the LLC to pursue its suit would essentially condemn the village to relitigate issues already decided in all potential suits filed by anyone with a property interest in the shopping center. This was what res judicata was meant to prevent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sex offenses against a child. At trial, the State called another witness to testify concerning defendant's sexual assault against her that led to his conviction of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in another county. Defendant's appointed counsel had represented the witness in a previous juvenile proceeding as guardian ad litem. The Appellate Court of Illinois held that defense counsel was laboring under a per se conflict of interest under the Sixth Amendment, because he had a previous association with an entity assisting the State. Counsel's prior representation of the witness was never disclosed to the trial court or waived on the record by defendant. Defendant's conviction had to be reversed, because counsel's representation might have been restrained by his prior commitments to the witness. For example, any information protected by the attorney-client privilege could have impacted his ability to effectively cross-examine the witness or attack her credibility.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that his convictions must be reversed because both the armed habitual criminal statute and the UUWF statute violated his constitutional right to bear arms. The appellate court ruled that the armed habitual criminal statute and the UUWF statute did not, on their faces, violate the Second Amendment, and the State was permitted to ban felons from possessing firearms. The restrictions fit proportionally with the interests the statutes served. Also, the armed habitual criminal statute did not violate the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws. The armed habitual criminal statute did not punish defendant for his prior convictions, but rather for a new and separate subsequent crime. However, simultaneous possession of four weapons could support only one conviction for violation of the armed habitual criminal statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Lake County Circuit Court (Illinois) granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence located after a police officer stopped defendant's vehicle because she was driving without a seatbelt, the officer learned her driving privileges had been suspended and that she could not produce an insurance card, and the officer located contraband when he conducted an inventory search as the vehicle was being prepared for impoundment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendant's car because she was not wearing a seat belt. The officer then learned that her driving privileges had been suspended and that she could not produce an insurance card. The officer arrested her. A tow truck was called so that the vehicle could be impounded. While the officer waited for the tow truck, he conducted an inventory search. Under the driver's seat, he found evidence that defendant unlawfully possessed a controlled substance. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence found. The appellate court found that once the officer learned that defendant had a suspended license and did not have an insurance card, the officer had a mandatory obligation under 625 ILCS 5/6-303(e) (2008) to impound the vehicle because it could not be operated until proof of insurance was shown. It then added that the officer was not required to determine whether a teenage passenger with defendant at the time of the arrest could have driven the vehicle away and that the officer's inventory search conducted pursuant to police department policy furthered a &quot;community caretaking&quot; function, making the search reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church sought an declaration that it could operate a church on certain property. The trial court denied the church's requested relief. The court affirmed on appeal.

The church could not reasonably rely on the illegality of the preamendment zoning ordinance when entering into the contract and expending money in an effort to buy the property. The trial court did not err in denying the church's preliminary injunction motion. Because churches, regardless of the makeup of their congregation, as well as all other nonrevenue-producing organizations, were prohibited in a certain commercial district, the amended ordinance did not show discrimination based on race, color or national origin under 740 ILCS 23/5 (2008).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The drivers were asked to and did submit to blood-alcohol tests.

Both drivers sought administrative review in the circuit court, and in each case the circuit court affirmed the decision of the Secretary. The appellate court ruled that where the evidence was insufficient to establish that the drivers were involved in motor vehicle accidents which resulted in death or personal injuries within the meaning of the statute, they should not have been subjected to blood-alcohol tests and their driving privileges should not have been suspended. The Secretary expanded the implied-consent statute to include accidents which could be of a less serious nature, where the injuries were not so severe that they required that a person be carried from the scene by ambulance, but where a person was carried from the scene by ambulance regardless of the severity of the injuries.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee determined after she left her sales position with the former employer that it was investigating her.

It counterclaimed for breach of fiduciary duty. A jury awarded her compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court in a bench trial awarded it compensatory and punitive damages despite no evidence showing that any customer left it to work with her at her new employer. Pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-1207 (2004), the trial court reduced the jury's punitive damage award to her. The appellate court found that the former employer was liable for the conduct of its agents, as it did not limit the investigation and used the information it was given. It also reinstated the full punitive damage award to her, especially given the large amount of attorney fees she incurred.

The trial court granted a 735 ILCS 5/2-619 (2008) motion to dismiss asserting that the taxpayers' subsequent lawsuit was barred on res judicata grounds. It also granted Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 137 sanctions against the taxpayers' attorneys for filing a frivolous lawsuit. The appellate court found that (1) res judicata barred the subsequent lawsuit since the taxpayers were in privity with the earlier lawsuit plaintiffs, there was an identity of the two actions, and the earlier lawsuit terminated on its merits; (2) the Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 137 sanctions awarded were proper; and (3) the Citizen Participation Act did not bar entry of the sanction award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, that convicted him of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon and of being an armed habitual criminal under 720 ILCS 5/24-1.7 (2008), arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support the latter conviction and that the armed criminal statute violated his constitutional right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected defendant's contention that the State failed to prove him guilty of being an armed habitual criminal because the State failed to prove that he owned the vehicle in which the handgun was found or had knowledge of the gun's presence in his girlfriend's vehicle. Defendant's knowledge was presumed because defendant had control and possession of the vehicle, defendant abandoned the vehicle as police officers approached, and the gun was in plain view in the back seat. Knowledge could be established by evidence of defendant's conduct from which it could be inferred that he knew of the gun's presence. Further, the armed habitual criminal statute did not violate defendant's Second Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. II, right to bear arms. While the Second Amendment vested individuals with the right to bear arms to protect oneself in one's home, it did not give people the right to bear arms in public. The right to bear arms was subject to some restrictions, and the legislature was vested with the authority to disqualify certain classifications of people, such as convicted felons, from the exercise of Second Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court, County Department, Chancery Division (Illinois), entered a judgment that granted defendant amendment proponents' 735 ILCS 5/2-619 (2008) motion to dismiss plaintiff nearby private property owners' legal challenge to the city council's approval of an amendment to a city-planned development. The nearby private property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nearby private property owners sued defendant amendment proponents to challenge the city council's decision to approve an amendment to one of the city's planned developments pursuant to the Chicago Zoning Ordinance, which allowed for the construction of a children's museum and a new park district field house facility in a city park. The trial court granted the amendment proponents' motion to dismiss pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-619 (2008) asserting that the relevant complaint was defective because the nearby property owners failed to comply with Illinois Municipal Code notice requirements set forth in 65 ILCS 5/11-13-8 (2008). The appellate court rejected the nearby private property owners' claim that compliance with 65 ILCS 5/11-13-8 (2008), which they conceded had not occurred, was not necessary since their amended complaint was not a declaratory judgment action but rather an independent action brought pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/11-13-25 (2008) of the Illinois Municipal Code. It found that recent authority had held that 65 ILCS 5/11-13-25 (2008) did not afford private property owners an independent cause of action to challenge any type of zoning ordinance amendments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by granting defendant's motion to suppress because: (1) defendant's conduct of activating his right turn signal and driving past three opportunities to turn was not a traffic violation under 625 ILCS 5/11-804(d) and therefore the officer's stop of defendant's vehicle was not objectively justified by reasonable suspicion; and (2) the officer's mistaken belief that defendant's conduct amounted to a traffic violation did not justify the stop at its inception. The court rejected the State's contention that defendant's conduct violated 625 ILCS 5/12-208(b), 12-212 because those statutes governed a vehicle's equipment, not the driver's conduct. The State forfeited its claim that the officer had a reasonable articulable suspicion of a violation of 625 ILCS 5/12-101(a) because it raised it for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicted defendant of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon (AUUW), under 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6(a)(1), (a)(3)(A) (2008), and unlawful possession of a firearm, under 720 ILCS 5/24-3.1(a)(1) (2008). He was sentenced to 24 months of probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the amended AUUW statute applied retroactively to the facts of his case because the amendment merely clarified the original intent of the statute under which he was convicted. The appellate court held that the amended AUUW statute did not apply because the incident involving defendant occurred more than a year before the effective date of the statutory amendments. Even if the statutory amendments applied, defendant's conviction would still stand because defendant did not have the requisite permission to possess the gun. The owner of the home and yard where defendant was arrested, denied that defendant had a gun. Defendant also denied having a gun. Thus, it could have been inferred that the owner did not give defendant the requisite &quot;permission&quot; to possess a gun on his land. Further, 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6 (2008) did not violate defendant's second amendment rights because it was substantially related to the important governmental objective of keeping police officers and the general public safe and the fit between the AUUW statute and the government objective was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Kendall County, Illinois, convicting him of one count of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) under 625 ILCS 5/11-501 (2006), a Class 1 felony, and sentencing him to 7 1/2 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offense was a Class 1 felony because defendant had four prior convictions of DUI. Defendant argued that his offense must be reduced from a Class 1 felony to a Class 4 felony, and the cause remanded for resentencing, because 2005 Ill. Laws 94-116 (eff. Jan. 1, 2006), which created 625 ILCS 5/11-501(c-1)(4) and made his offense a Class 1 felony, was unconstitutional. The appellate court ruled that defendant was properly convicted of Class 1 felony DUI. By passing 2005 Ill. Laws 94-116, the Illinois Legislature set up a coherent and consistent scheme under which any fifth DUI would be a Class 1 felony, while any fourth DUI would be, at most, a Class 2 felony. Under 5 ILCS 70/6 (2006), the conflict between 2005 Ill. Laws 94-609 (eff. Jan. 1, 2006) and 2005 Ill. Laws 94-116 was not irreconcilable and the Illinois Legislature had not intended that the latter repeal the former. 2005 Ill. Laws 94-609 made only a limited change to 625 ILCS 5/11-501, which had nothing to do with 2005 Ill. Laws 94-116.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain her conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. The trial evidence showed that 87 cats were removed from defendant's two-bedroom residence. Many of the cats had upper respiratory tract infections. Testimony at trial reflected that one cat was &quot;severely infected&quot; with an upper respiratory tract infection and had to be euthanized. A witness testified that no more than five cats should be kept in one residence to ensure a healthy environment for the animals. He testified that upper respiratory tract infections can continue circulating, being repeatedly passed from cat to cat, so that, in an overcrowded environment, none of the cats can ever recover. Defendant failed to protect her cat from a disease that would have been both preventable and treatable had she not allowed an excess of 80 stray cats into her residence. Furthermore, defendant's conduct of calling the animal control office and authorizing the animal control facility to remove and take custody of all 87 cats indicated that she was aware that she was unable to provide any of the cats with adequate humane care and treatment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action against defendants, a county, its commissioners, and its sheriff, plaintiff gun owners sought review of a dismissal pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-615 by the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, of their request for a declaration that Cook County, Ill., Ordinance No. 06-O-50 (2006) was unconstitutional. A prior affirmance was vacated, and the court reconsidered in light of McDonald v. City of Chicago.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance, which amended Cook County, Ill., Code of Ordinances &sect; 54-211, banned certain assault weapons and assault ammunition. The owners claimed, inter alia, that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and that it violated U.S. Const. amend. II. Upon reconsideration, the court affirmed. While the United States Supreme Court precedent of Heller had recognized that a prohibition on handgun possession in the home violated the Second Amendment, no such protection was afforded to those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes. Using an intermediate scrutiny standard of review, the ordinance was found to be constitutional as it was sufficiently tailored in its restrictions to rapid-firing or high-capacity weapons. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague as it gave definitions and examples as objective criteria for its enforcement. The overbreadth doctrine did not apply as U.S. Const. amend. I rights were not implicated. An equal protection argument failed as assault weapons owners did not constitute a suspect classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lessor sued defendants, school district and finance authority. The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, granted summary judgment in favor of the district, and separately granted the claimant a judgment declaring that the authority lacked the power to cancel contracts except in accord with contract cancellation provisions. The authority and claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district leased portable classrooms from the lessor, and agreed to pay a cancellation fee if it cancelled the leases before the termination of the lease terms. The finance authority later cancelled the district's leases. The finance authority did not direct the district to pay the cancellation fees established in the leases, and the district did not pay the fees. The trial court found that the finance authority ordered the district not to pay the cancellation fees and that the order made performance by the district legally impossible. The trial court declared that the finance authority lacked the power to cancel contracts except in accord with contract cancellation provisions. The appellate court ruled that the trial court did not err when it found, due to a legal impossibility created when the State invoked the School Finance Law, 105 ILCS 5/1F-1 et seq. (2004), that the district lacked statutory authority to pay the lessor its cancellation fees. The State invoked the School Finance Law, which provided the finance authority exclusive control over the district's finances, the district was divested of control over its finances and had no statutory authority to pay its debts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, which dismissed his post-conviction petition following a third-stage evidentiary hearing on the issue of his actual innocence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was 15-years-old when he was involved in a shooting where one person was killed and another person was injured. He was convicted of first degree murder and attempted first degree murder. A petition for post-conviction relief was dismissed, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court held that a sentence that was void could have been attacked at any time. The appellate court rejected the inmate's assertion that the trial court was required to sentence him under the Illinois Juvenile Court Act, 705 ILCS 405/1-1 et seq (1996). Former 705 ILCS 405/5-4(6)(a) (1996) covered the five enumerated charges therein and all other charges arising out of the same incident. The inmate's conviction for attempted murder arose out of the same incident as his conviction for first degree murder. Pursuant to former 705 ILCS 405/5-4(6)(c)(i) (1996), the trial court properly sentenced the inmate under the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections, 730 ILCS 5/5-1-1 et seq (1996). Because the attempted murder charge was an offense covered by former 705 ILCS 405/5-4(6)(a) (1996), the State did not need to request a hearing to have the inmate sentenced in criminal court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Illinois Department of Revenue decided that appellant taxpayers' gambling winnings for 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 were taxable income and that their gambling losses for those years were not deductible. The Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois) affirmed the Department's decision. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the Department did not clearly err by concluding that the taxpayers' gambling activity did not constitute a trade or business, and therefore the activity constituted causal gambling and the taxpayers were not entitled to a state tax deduction for their losses, because the evidence showed that the taxpayers did not devote themselves full time to gambling but rather that one taxpayer continued to work full time in the graphic arts industry where he drew a comfortable salary that supported their gambling. The court rejected the taxpayers' due process challenges to the Illinois Income Tax Act because the tax on gambling winnings did not constitute double taxation, as gambling winnings that represented the return of capital were not taxable under federal law, which Illinois followed, and thus were excluded from gross income before adjusted gross income was determined. In addition, gambling winnings had long been considered income under federal tax law and Illinois law acceded to that characterization by not permitting exclusion of gambling winnings from adjusted gross income as carried over from the federal return.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant son challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County, Illinois, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee bank in a breach of contract action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son received a settlement when he was a minor, and the proceeds were deposited in an account with instructions that they were not to be withdrawn without a court order. However, his mother removed funds from the account. The son later filed an action against his mother and the bank. Summary judgment was granted to the bank on the basis of a three-year limitations period, and this appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court held that the three-year limitation period in 810 ILCS 5/4-111 (2006) applied in this case, despite the son's claim of a common law breach of contract. 810 ILCS 5/4-401(a) (2006) applied to situations where a withdrawal was alleged to be in breach of a signatory card and included instructions that formed the bank/customer agreement. However, the son's cause of action was not necessarily time barred. The discovery rule had been utilized by Illinois courts for Uniform Commercial Code and breach of contract cases, and fraudulent concealment by the mother could have tolled the statute of limitations as well. The trial court had to determine on remand when the son knew, or had reason to know, that a cause of action might have existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, four riverboat casinos, appealed after the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County, Illinois, granted motions to dismiss filed by defendants, the Illinois State Treasurer and the Illinois Racing Board, and intervenor defendant race tracks. The casinos had challenged the constitutionality of 2007 Ill. Laws 1008 (Act) (amending 230 ILCS 10/7 (2006))</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act required the casinos to pay 3% of their adjusted gross receipts (AGR) into a fund to be distributed to the state's horse racing tracks. Casinos with 2004 AGR under $200 million were exempt from the tax. The casinos each had 2004 AGR in excess of $200 million. They challenged the Act based on the uniformity-clause, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, arguing in part that the 2007 AGR should have been used. The tracks argued that the challenge was barred by collateral estoppel as the tax classification had been upheld in litigation regarding an almost identical 2006 statute. The appellate court did not address the collateral estoppel issue as it ruled that the tax classification was not unconstitutional. The four casinos were the highest grossing casinos in the state and had AGR over $200 million in both 2004 and 2007. No other casinos had that size AGR in those years. The four casinos were the only ones in the state that would be subject to the tax, regardless of which AGR year was used. The legislature's determination that the four casinos were in the best position to absorb the tax for three years following the enactment of the Act was not arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was alleged that 2009 Ill. Laws 34, 2009 Ill. Laws 35, 2009 Ill. Laws 37, and 2009 Ill. Laws 38 were unconstitutional. Plaintiffs were not able to file a complaint under 735 ILCS 5/11-303 (2008), and they sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the single subject rule under Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d) regulated the process by which legislation was enacted. It was designed to prevent the passage of legislation that, if standing alone, could not have mustered the necessary votes for enactment. The wide range of topics in 2009 Ill. Laws 34 could not have been considered to possess a natural and logical connection to the single subject of revenue to the state. 2009 Ill. Laws 34 did not involve the single subject of implementation of the state budget. When an act violated the single subject rule, it had to be struck in its entirety. Pursuant to their own terms, 2009 Ill. Laws 35, 2009 Ill. Laws 37, and 2009 Ill. Laws 38 were all contingent upon the enactment of 2009 Ill. Laws 34. Therefore, because 2009 Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit Fulton County, Illinois, convicting him of resisting a peace officer in violation of 720 ILCS 5/31-1 (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an alderman for the city. The city had published notice that the city's budget was available for viewing during normal business hours. Defendant was later informed by the budget director that he could not obtain a copy of the budget at that time. The same day defendant went to city hall, accompanied by his wife and friend. Defendant's wife prepared a video recording of the events that transpired when defendant went to city hall concerning the budget. The budget director informed defendant that the mayor had directed him not to distribute copies of the budget until the following Monday. Defendant was ultimately charged with refusing the police chief's request that defendant exit the city private offices. The appellate court ruled that defendant's acts did not constitute resistance under 720 ILCS 5/31-1. Defendant merely disputed the chief's authority to ask defendant to leave the private city office space based on defendant's reasonable belief that he had a right to be present. Defendant's act of verbally disputing the chief's authority for a brief time did not constitute resisting a peace officer.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant claimed his two convictions were of minimal probative value and were highly prejudicial. The court of appeals disagreed. The record clearly revealed that the trial court was aware of its discretion and exercised it stating that: &quot;I understand the arguments of both of the parties and I think that there is always a careful balancing test to be performed when admitting proof of other crimes. In this case, the defendant is charged with burglary and the element is did he intend to commit a theft, so it is somewhat prejudicial that the defendant's five prior felony convictions are all thefts. On the other hand, that has to be balanced against the defendant's testimony and his credibility.&quot; Rather than &quot;verbal homage&quot; to the balancing test, the trial court's ruling demonstrated reasoned application. While defendant's convictions were not recent, it could not be said that the trial court applied the balancing test improperly. That others might have reached a different result did not render the trial court's decision erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of first degree murder. After several direct appeals and motions for postconviction relief, defendant appealed the trial court's order denying defendant leave to file his fourth postconviction petition and dismissing his petition under 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 (2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying postconviction relief because new evidence showed that four officers involved in defendant's interrogation were implicated in allegations of torture, coercion, and misconduct. The court of appeals disagreed. Only two examples cited by defendant to show a pattern and practice of abuse could have been known to the State at the time of defendant's trial. One was a 1991 incident involving a detective, in which he was reprimanded for failing to have a youth officer in the interrogation room, as required when questioning a juvenile suspect. Even if the State were aware of the reprimand, it was unclear why the State had a duty to disclose that information under Brady. Defendant did not allege that the detective was involved in defendant's interrogation and defendant's successive postconviction petitions did not name him in his allegations of police brutality. Further, the detective's reprimand did not involve similar methods of abuse as alleged by defendant. Therefore, that evidence could not be deemed material to defendant's allegations that police brutality compelled his confession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee food broker sued appellant corporation to recover commissions owed to the broker for services it rendered in Ohio. The corporation did not file an appearance, and a default judgment was entered against it in Ohio. The broker registered the Ohio judgment in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. Thirty-seven days later, the corporation moved to quash the broker's registration of the Ohio judgment. The trial court denied the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A motion to vacate a void judgment for lack of service that was filed more than 30 days after the judgment was entered was properly designated a 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 (2008) petition. An attack on a judgment on the basis of voidness may be construed as a 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 (2008) petition, and satisfaction of the time constraints or the requirement of a meritorious defense or due diligence was not necessary. Accordingly, the corporation's motion to quash registration of the Ohio judgment was in effect a petition under 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 (2008). The denial of the corporation's motion was therefore a final and appealable order under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 304(b)(3), vesting the court with jurisdiction. Review of a judgment on a 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 (2008) petition that was requesting relief based on the allegation that the judgment was void, shall be de novo. The technical defects in both the broker and the corporation's names during the course of the litigation were not fatal to the registration and entry of the Ohio judgment, nor could it be said that the real parties in interest were not at the table. The corporation's argument that the broker committed fraud therefore failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, which recognized the Ohio judgment upon registration of that judgment in the trial court by the broker, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The street was a four-lane roadway with two lanes of northbound traffic and two lanes of southbound traffic. While traveling in the left-hand northbound lane, the officer twice observed defendant's vehicle's cross the lane divider between the two northbound lanes of traffic. The officer testified that both times defendant's vehicle barely went over the lane divider and that both times, defendant's tires crossed the line for a matter of seconds. The appellate court ruled that the trial court properly granted defendant's motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence. The officer provided no testimony from which to find that all parts of defendant's vehicle were not at all times physically within a single lane of traffic. The officer provided no testimony from which to find that an officer in his position could reasonably believe that defendant was actually driving in two lanes and was therefore engaged in improper lane usage in violation of 625 ILCS 5/11-709(a) (2006). The facts and circumstances surrounding the traffic stop did not provide a reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop defendant based on the officer's stated reason of a violation of 625 ILCS 5/11-709(a).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found the victim's testimony that defendant's penis went inside her anus and, thus, supported the relevant conviction, the trial court complied with Ill. Sup. Ct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicting him of two counts of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon under 720 ILCS 5/24-1.1(a) (2008) and six counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon (AUUW) under 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6 (2008), sentencing him to five years in prison, and assessing costs totaling $ 715.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the recent cases of Heller and McDonald should be extended to invalidate 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6 (2008) and held that the statute did not violate the Second Amendment because there was a rational basis to the statute's ban on carrying and possessing loaded firearms outside of the home, namely the protection of police officers and the general public. Nor did Heller or McDonald render 720 ILCS 5/24-1.1(a) (2008) unconstitutional because defendant was found to be in possession of a handgun and ammunition while standing on a public street. However, the court held that the trial court erred by assessing defendant a $ 10 mental health fee, a $ 5 youth diversion fee, a $ 30 Children's Advocacy Center fee, and a $ 5 drug court fee because none of those fees were designed to reimburse the State for money it expended in prosecuting defendant, and therefore they were all fines for which presentence incarceration credit of $ 5 per day was authorized. The charges totaled $ 50 and defendant was entitled to that amount in credit from his presentence incarceration credit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and sentences were affirmed. The costs were modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The salesperson, acting as an independent contractor, sold advertisements on a Web site for homes that were for sale by owner. She was paid for each advertisement she sold. The company that owned the Web site entered into a consent order admitting that its activities amounted to unlicensed practice of real estate in violation of 225 ILCS 454/20-10 (2002) and agreeing to become a licensed corporate broker and to pay a fine. The court held that the salesperson engaged in licensed activities under 225 ILCS 454/1-10 (2002) because she used language resembling that of licensed brokers and actively referred clients to the Web site for advice on marketing and selling their homes. She acted for another, within the meaning of &sect; 20-10, because she was not merely acting for herself. Although she did not receive commissions on the sale of homes, the payments she received were compensation under &sect; 1-10. The court exercised its discretion under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 366(a)(5) to reduce the fine, noting that the company that owned the Web site had paid a significantly smaller fine. The court further held that a constitutional free speech argument was waived by failure to raise it sufficiently below.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's decision as modified to reflect a reduction in the fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brother appealed an order the Circuit Court of Boone County (Illinois) dismissing, under 735 ILCS 5/2-619 (2008), his medical malpractice action against defendants, two hospitals, several health services and treatment centers, and five doctors, which alleged that defendants were negligent in the postoperative care and treatment of the decedent, the brother's sister, and that their negligence caused her death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the brother's action as a Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 219(c) sanction for failing to produce his expert for deposition and on the ground that the expert was not qualified to author the physican's report. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by dismissing the brother's complaint because his expert was qualified to author the physician's report under 735 ILCS 5/2--622(a) (2004), as: (1) his report sufficiently set for the requisite &sect; 2-622(a)(1) qualifications, including the fact that he was licensed to practice medicine in all its branches; (2) the expert had practiced within the last six years in the same area of health care law that was at issue, namely patients undergoing abdominal surgery and postoperative care; (3) the expert included detailed reasons for his determination that defendants' conduct fell below the standard of care; and (4) the expert's depositions showed that he had practiced in the last six years within the same area of health care at issue. The trial court also erred by dismissing the brother's complaint as a sanction for the failure to produce the expert for a deposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Glen Ellyn, Ill., Ordinance No. 3810 (1991) contained a condition that antennas on a water tower were to be kept to a minimum. Glen Ellyn, Ill., Ordinance 5606 (2007) allowed for the installation of a cellular antenna structure on the water tower. After the residents' first complaint was dismissed, they were granted leave to file a second amended complaint. A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim was granted, and this appeal followed. In partially affirming, the appellate court held that the residents had standing challenge Glen Ellyn, Ill., Ordinance 3810 (1991) based on the language contained in 65 ILCS 5/11-13-15 (2008) and Glen Ellyn, Illinois, Zoning Code &sect; 10-10-18(B). However, the residents failed to state a claim that the at a minimum requirement was violated. As to Glen Ellyn, Ill., Ordinance 5606 (2007), the village was properly named as a defendant since it was the owner of the property, and the residents had standing. A claim relating to radio frequency (RF) was preempted by the Telecommunications Act. However, the other allegations relating to Glen Ellyn, Ill., Ordinance 5606 (2007) should not have been dismissed for failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the trial court: (1) erred in rejecting his supplemental questions during voir dire regarding racial and ethnic bias; and (2) failed to comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 431(b). The appellate court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to ask the supplemental questions. Neither the State's theory of the prosecution nor the evidence demonstrated, in any fashion, that the crimes were motivated by race or ethnicity. Consequently, posing the proposed questions to the members of venire was irrelevant and would have tended to inject considerations of race into a case where the issue was absent. Although the trial court violated rule 431(b) by failing to ascertain whether the potential jurors understood and accepted each of the four Zehr principles, defendant forfeited the issue by failing to object at trial or in his posttrial motion. There was sufficient circumstantial evidence to link defendant to the crimes charged. While defendant claimed the evidence was closely balanced, he offered no challenge to its sufficiency. Because the evidence against defendant was not closely balanced, the appellate court honored the procedural default.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant motor vehicle dealer filed a second-amended complaint against appellees, corporation, its wholly owned subsidiary, and its president, for violations of the Motor Vehicle Franchise Act, 815 ILCS 710/1 et seq. (2008), fraud, and tortious interference with contract. The Circuit Court of Sangamon County, Illinois dismissed 12 of the 14 counts. The dealer filed a notice of interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that issues as to whether good cause existed to cancel or terminate a franchise or the refusal to extend the franchise were matters best left to the arbitrator or the Motor Vehicle Review Board under &sect; 12(d) (815 ILCS 710/12(d) (2008)) of the Motor Vehicle Franchise Act and not the judiciary. As the circuit court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the 815 ILCS 710/4(d)(6) (2008) claims, the portions of the order dealing with those respective claims in the second-amended complaint were void and would not be addressed in the appeal. The allegations in two of the counts were nothing more than conclusions without specific facts in support. Thus, the dealer failed to state a cause of action under 815 ILCS 710/9(a) (2008). Although the dealer alleged the termination or nonrenewal of the franchise occurring after May 22, 2009, even with good cause, entitled the dealer to damages under 815 ILCS 710/9.5(a) (2009), the dealer failed to state a cause of action under 815 ILCS 710/9.5 because the sales and service agreement remained in effect and had not been terminated, and the subsidiary offered an extension of the agreement until December 31, 2012.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention that 720 ILCS 5/24-1.7 was unconstitutional because defendant failed to show that making his prior convictions independent elements of the offense, rather than a sentencing enhancement, violated due process. Trial counsel was not ineffective for stipulating to defendant's prior convictions because doing so was inarguably less prejudicial than making the prior convictions an issue in the case. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a bifurcated trial because defendant failed to show that the trial court was authorized or compelled to order a bifurcated trial based on his prior convictions being elements of the offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Carroll County (Illinois) granting defendant's motion to suppress bank records belonging to her and her husband. Defendant had been charged with theft of property over $ 10,000 in violation of 720 ILCS 5/16-1(a)(2) (2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of obtaining by deception control over property in a bank in the amount of $ 40,200. On appeal, the court held that defendant did have a right to privacy in her bank records under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court held that the intrusion was not reasonable under the Banking Act (Act), 205 ILCS 5/48.1 (2008) because: (1) there was no evidence supporting either that a police officer relied on the Act to make his or request of the bank or that the bank disclosed the records in reliance on the Act; and (2) the Act in no way provided an exception for state action. The intrusion was not reasonable in light of the parties' relationship, employee and employer, because the question was not whether the bank intruded into defendant's privacy but whether the State did. The court could not conclude that the State's request for documents, failure to obtain a subpoena or warrant, and intrusion on defendant's constitutional right to privacy in her bank records were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee priest was convicted of the aggravated criminal sexual abuse of three minors and served a term of incarceration for those convictions. Following a jury trial, the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) adjudicated him a sexually violent person under the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act (Act), 725 ILCS 207/1 et seq. (2006)), but permitted conditional release. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred by granting the priest conditional release. The appellate court held that the trial court's comment that one doctor's rescoring of the actuarial tests was &quot;without foundation in the record&quot; was supported by the doctor's testimony. The opinion was literally without foundation in the record and the trial court's characterization of it as such was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting conditional release because two experts believed that the priest was unlikely to reoffend for a variety of reasons, and all of the actuarial tests administered by the various doctors reflected a low or, at most, moderate risk of rearrest for similar offenses. Additionally, the priest accepted responsibility for his actions, voluntarily admitted to previously unknown offenses, and was motivated and cooperative during his treatment in the secure detention facility. Moreover, the therapy he was receiving now would be more effective the restrictions and conditions imposed on the priest during his release were extensive.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that (1) he could not show he had been prejudiced when trial counsel stated defendant would testify and he did not do so; (2) the prior conviction evidence did not involve an offense too remote in time, but did involve a sufficiently similar offense for admissibility purposes; (3) the statute allowing admission of that evidence did not violate due process since the trial court under it could bar evidence that was too prejudicial; and (4) the State proved that he acted so as to threaten or endanger life and, thus, showed he violated the aggravated criminal sexual assault statute,&nbsp;720 ILCS 5/12-14(a)(3) (2006).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the taxpayers' complaint failed to sufficiently plead a violation of the privileges and immunities clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 1, because nowhere in the complaint did the taxpayers provide any factual allegations supporting their conclusion that residents of a foreign state who moved to the city and purchased real estate did not cause inadequate school funding. The taxpayers' complaint failed to state a claim that the ordinance was not rationally related to a legitimate government interest as required for a claim under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the allegations showed that the ordinance made a reasonable distinction between those adding new burdens to the schools, who were subject to the transfer tax, and those who did not add to the underfunding, those were exempt from paying the tax. The taxpayers' claim that the tax violated the uniformity clause of Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 was also properly dismissed because it was reasonable to impose on new residents the one-time burden of contributing to the maintenance of a school district, as new residents generally will add to the school population and costs.</SPAN></P>

Defendant performed the nine-step-walk-and-turn test correctly but failed the one-legged-stand test because he swayed slightly and raised his arms more than six inches past his side. The trooper arrested defendant; defendant agreed to take a Breathalyzer test, which registered a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.11. On appeal, the court affirmed. While defendant argued that the State failed for provide a proper foundation that the Breathalyzer was tested regularly for accuracy and was working properly, the foundation testimony did not violate the Confrontation Clause, U.S. Const. amend. VI, because the certification regarding the device's testing was not testimonial as the person performing the testing of the device's accuracy did so with no particular prosecutorial use in mind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of the 9th Judicial Circuit, Hancock County, Illinois found defendant guilty of unlawful use of property, 720 ILCS 646/35(a) (2008), unlawful possession of methamphetamine precursor, 720 ILCS 646/20(b)(1) (2008), unlawful possession of methamphetamine, 720 ILCS 646/60(a) (2008), obstructing justice, 720 ILCS 5/31-4(a) (2008), and aggravated fleeing, 625 ILCS 5/11-204.1(a)(1) (2008).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that his conviction for unlawful use of property cannot stand as &sect; 35 of the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, 720 ILCS 646/35 (2008) was unconstitutional as it bore no reasonable relationship to a legitimate state interest. The appellate court found that 720 ILCS 646/35 satisfied the rational basis test because: (1) its language showed the legislature intended to safeguard the public welfare from the harm caused by manufacturing and distribution of methamphetamine; (2) prohibiting the use of a vehicle to bring about a violation of the Act was a reasonable method of accomplishing the Act's desired objective: that was, reducing or eliminating methamphetamine-related crimes in the state and the corresponding harm caused by those crimes; and (3) 720 ILCS 646/35's proscription against using vehicles to bring about a violation of the Act was reasonably designed to remedy the evils that the legislature has determined to be a threat to the public health, safety and general welfare of the state and was reasonably related to stopping the manufacturing and distribution of methamphetamine in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed with the exception of defendant's conviction for possession of methamphetamine, which was vacated as a lesser-included offense of unlawful use of property. The case was remanded to the circuit court to modify its sentencing order consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant judgment debtor appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied its motion to quash plaintiff judgment creditor's registration of a foreign judgment under the Illinois Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, 735 ILCS 5/12-650 et seq. (2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor obtained a judgment against the debtor in Ohio. The debtor was served with the complaint according to the rules of Ohio civil procedure. It did not file an appearance, and a default judgment was entered against it in Ohio. The motion to quash was filed more than 30 days after the registration of the Ohio judgment in the circuit court. The court observed that the foreign judgment was subject under 735 ILCS 5/12-652(a) (2008) to the same procedures and defenses as any judgment entered in the circuit court, including the requirement of 735 ILCS 5/2-1203(a) (2008) that a posttrial motion be filed within 30 days. Because the motion to quash was untimely, the court construed it as a petition under 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 (2008) and found it appealable under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 304(b)(3). The court characterized the debtor's allegation that the creditor was not registered to do business in Ohio as intrinsic fraud in the procurement of the Ohio judgment; as such, it was a defense that the debtor could advance in an Ohio court. Technical defects in the parties' names during the course of the litigation were not fatal to the registration and did not amount to fraud.</SPAN></P>

It then limited their attorney fee award to the fees connected to the motion to dismiss. He appealed; they cross-appealed the fee ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vocal opponents started a campaign to have the coach removed as a high school's head basketball coach and athletic director due to their disagreement with his coaching style. When the school board did not remove him, they continued the campaign. Eventually, the school board removed him as a coach although he remained as an athletic director. The coach sued the vocal opponents alleging defamation, false light, and tortious interference claims. The trial court dismissed all claims against them upon finding that they had immunity under the Citizen Participation Act, 735 ILCS 110/1 et seq. (2008) (Act). It then limited their attorney fee award to the fees incurred in obtaining dismissal under the Act. The appellate court found that (1) the coach did not show that the Act was unconstitutional, as the legislature in enacting it properly balanced the right to petition the government for favorable action and a party's right to common law relief; (2) the Act applied to their attempts to get the school board to act favorably; and (3) the trial court, pursuant to the Act, properly limited the attorney fee award to the vocal opponents despite the case involved more than the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit, Peoria County, Illinois, which convicted him of armed robbery and sentenced him to 26 years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with four counts of armed robbery, and he entered a written waiver of a trial by jury. Later, he entered into a partially negotiated plea agreement where three of the counts were dismissed. The trial court announced that the parties had decided to proceed by way of a stipulated bench trial as to one count of robbery so that defense counsel could have later challenged the constitutionality of a 20-year sentencing enhancement under 720 ILCS 5/18-2(b) (2008). Defendant was sentenced to 26 years in prison, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court rejected the argument that the stipulated bench trial was tantamount to a guilty plea and that a remand was necessary for the trial court to comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 605(c) and Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d). Defense counsel did not stipulate that the facts presented by the State were sufficient for a finding of guilt. Moreover, it was clear that defense counsel was proceeding to a stipulated bench trial to preserve the constitutional issue. Defendant, with full knowledge and understanding of the proceedings, was allowed to preserve an issue for appeal and still receive the benefit of the plea proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a minor, through her father, filed a declaratory judgment action against appellees, school district and Illinois State Board of Education, and asserted that a $ 350 fee for a drivers' education course was unauthorized under Ill. Adm. Code tit. 23, &sect; 252.30(a)(3), amended at 32 Ill. Reb. 10935 (2008), and Ill. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois dismissed the case with prejudice. The minor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the minor alleged that the district's request and renewal applications for waiver under 105 ILCS 5/2-3.25g(c) (2008) of the Illinois School Code, 105 ILCS 5/27-23 (2008), which sought to increase the driver's education fees in the district to include staffing costs, were unconstitutional under the free education clause, Ill. Const art. X, &sect; 1, and were therefore invalid, 105 ILCS 5/27-23 (2008) provided that the school district may charge a reasonable fee, and the language of the statute must be given its plain and ordinary meaning, which illustrated that it was never intended to be free. Therefore, because driver's education was not covered by the free education clause, the $ 350 Drivers Education Course fee did not violate Ill. Const art. X, &sect; 1, and the minor's complaint against the school district was properly dismissed with prejudice. The Illinois State Board of Education did not have the obligation to reject the district's waiver request for anything other than completeness, 105 ILCS 5/2-3.25g(d) (2008), and that completeness review did not warrant consideration of Ill. Admin. Code tit. 23, &sect; 252.30(a)(3). Therefore, the Board was not a proper party defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the patient was a resident of the center, the doctor prescribed a medication for the patient that adversely affected her. When the patient had not filed her health care professional's report under 735 ILCS 5/2-622 within 90 days after filing her medical malpractice complaint, defendants made a motion to dismiss. The patient responded with a motion for additional time to file the report and filed the report, without leave of the trial court, within two weeks of the motion to dismiss. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice on the basis that 735 ILCS 5/2-622 only allowed one 90-day extension for the filing of the report. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Because 2005 Ill. Laws 677, which had added the provision regarding only one 90-day extension, had been declared unconstitutional after the action had been filed, 735 ILCS 5/2-622 reverted to its pre-2005 provisions, which did not include the limitation on extensions to file the report. The action was remanded for the trial court to determine whether the patient could establish good cause for not filing the report within 90 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's dismissal and remanded to the trial court for consideration of whether the patient should have extra time to filed the health care professional's report and whether striking the report that the patient filed previously was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-husband's motion to disqualify alleged a conflict of interest in the attorney representing the daughter and that, pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, 750 ILCS 5/506 (2008) and article IX of the Supreme Court Rules, Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 900 et seq., the daughter could only be represented only by independent court-appointed counsel. The trial court did not make a finding of a conflict of interest but disqualified the attorney on the second ground alleged and appointed a county representative for the daughter. The court found that because the ex-husband did not have custody of the daughter and she was not involved in any custody or visitation matter, article IX was inapplicable to the daughter. Article IX was not a vehicle to appoint counsel. Rather, it represented a minimum standard or guideline when the trial court did appoint counsel for a minor who was involved in a custody dispute, so that the custody matter was expedited. Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion by exceeding its authority and disqualifying the attorney pursuant to &sect; 506 of the Dissolution of Marriage Act and article IX.</SPAN></P>

VII, &sect; 6(e)(2) because the tax was on tangible personal property and the ordinance expressly declared that the tax was to be paid by the purchaser. 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1(2002) did not apply because the bottled water tax was a sales tax rather than an occupation tax and was not measured by the gross receipts from sales but instead was a flat amount on each bottle sold. The uniformity clause in art. IX, &sect; 2 was not violated because a real and substantial difference existed between the bottled water taxed and the beverages marketed for certain specific features, such as flavoring, that were not taxed and the classification bore a reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation to discourage the purchase of bottled water to, inter alia, conserve energy from nonrenewable sources because the bottles were made from nonrenewable petroleum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by excluding his proposed testimony of a private investigator regarding the transferability of gunshot residue and that defendant's hands could have acquired the gunshot residue from a contaminated environment rather than from handling the rifle. The court of appeals disagreed. The investigator utterly lacked the requisite education, experience or qualifications necessary to be offered as an expert. The investigator acknowledged that he was something of a hobbyist when it came to the analysis of gunshot residue beyond matters of basic collection of the evidence. Moreover, he did not exhibit any particular expertise in the area of transferability of gunshot residue over and above that offered by the State's expert who explained the dynamics of transference. The judge clearly understood the objective of the defense in offering the testimony and aptly perceived the shortcomings of the investigator's expertise as it related to that objective. It was clear the investigator lacked any education or training in the sciences nor did he have sufficient experience to support any such conclusions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For the eight years preceding 2006, the prior owners used the property for farming. In anticipation of a sale to the current owners, the prior owners declined to plant a crop in 2006. The sale closed in December 2006. The property was assessed as urban land for tax year 2006. The change in classification caused the assessed value of the subject property to rise from approximately $ 11,000 to over $ 3 million. The court found, inter alia, in order to qualify for farmland valuation and assessment under 35 ILCS 200/10-110 (2008) the property had to be used as a farm for the two preceding years as well as the year under review. Because the property was not used as a farm during 2006, the owners were not entitled to valuation and assessment as farmland.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Du Page County Circuit Court (Illinois), after preliminary proceedings, entered a judgment that granted plaintiff city's motion for immediate vesting of title under the Eminent Domain Act, 735 ILCS 30/20-5-5 (2008), in a case where the city sought to condemn defendant cemetery owner's cemetery as the city sought to expand its airport. The cemetery owner and defendant relatives appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city decided to undertake the enormous project of expanding its airport. While doing so, it sought to condemn the cemetery owner's cemetery. To that end, it filed an eminent-domain action. The cemetery owner and several relatives of people buried in the cemetery moved to dismiss the action. In a separate action, other relatives sought injunctive relief. The cases were consolidated. The trial court granted the city's motion for immediate vesting of title under the Eminent Domain Act, 735 ILCS 30/20-5-5 (2008). The appellate court found that res judicata barred the relatives from raising claims in the trial court arising out of the same group of operative facts that other parties had raised in an earlier federal court lawsuit involving the same matter. It also found that (1) the trial court did not err in denying the cemetery owner and relatives' motion to compel discovery upon finding that those parties already had the materials that they needed; and (2) the city sufficiently described the specific project it was undertaking and provided a definite timeline such that it complied with 735 ILCS 30/20-5-5(b) (2008) in moving for the vesting of title via the quick-take procedure.</SPAN></P>

(2008) (Act), because the foundation was not a &quot;public body&quot; under the Act. Defendant state labor department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foundation, a not-for-profit corporation functioning as a Presbyterian ministry for college students, contracted with the construction company to build student housing and parking on its property. Financing, in part, stemmed from tax-free bonds issued through the Illinois Finance Authority. It sought summary judgment in a declaratory judgment case against the state labor department in which it claimed that the Prevailing Wage Act, 820 ILCS 130/1 et seq. (2008), was inapplicable because the foundation was not a &quot;public body&quot; under the Act. The trial court granted summary judgment to the foundation, contractor, and subcontractors. The appellate court found that the foundation was a &quot;public body&quot; under the Act since it financed its project with tax-exempt bonds issued under the Illinois Finance Authority Act, 20 ILCS 3501/801-1 et seq. (2008). It also rejected the foundation's claims that the Act violated equal protection, since the Act was rationally related to protecting workers, or the establishment clauses of the state and federal constitutions because the foundation's status as a private religious foundation was irrelevant to its identity under the establishment clauses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) of armed robbery, aggravated kidnapping, and unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon. The trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms of 12 years, 27 years, and 12 years, for each offense, respectively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that because his testimony that he participated in the crimes to avert harm to his family constituted, at the very least, &quot;some evidence&quot; to support his affirmative defense of necessity, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the defense. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant had other reasonable alternatives to acting as an accomplice to armed robbery and aggravated kidnapping. Defendant's own testimony revealed that when defendant knew what was happening and had opportunities to withdraw or ask for help, he chose to continue his association with the principals and aid and abet them in their criminal conduct. Defendant testified that, after he knew that he was contributing to numerous crimes, he was left sitting alone in the van. Yet, defendant did not attempt to flee or use his cell phone to call 911 or anyone else; instead, he smoked marijuana. Despite the fact that defendant had ample opportunity to use his cell phone to call 911 or his family, he never did. Further, when defendant was driving the van while the principals were in the truck with the victim, he could have driven away instead of following them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon conviction under an accountability theory was reversed and the sentence was vacated. The case was remanded for resentencing on defendant's convictions of aggravated kidnapping. Defendant was given an additional day of jail credit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. He refused to submit to chemical testing and the State notified him his license would be suspended under 625 ILCS 5/11-501.1 (2008). Defendant's petition to rescind the summary suspension was denied. The Circuit Court of Livingston County (Illinois) ruled that the State was prohibited from presenting testimony from the suspension hearing in the criminal trial. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred by barring the use of defendant's testimony given at the rescission hearing as substantive evidence in the subsequent criminal proceeding. Defendant argued that he did not have a free choice whether to testify or remain silent at the rescission hearing, as the loss of his driving privileges was at stake. If he testified he risked being convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. If he remained silent, he risked the suspension of his driving privilege. The appellate court agreed with the State, concluding that since defendant chose to testify instead of claiming the privilege against self-incrimination, his disclosures were not compelled incriminations. Therefore, defendant was foreclosed from invoking the privilege when such information was later introduced against him in the criminal prosecution. Defendant's rescission-hearing testimony was entirely voluntary and subsequently admissible in the criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of three counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm and two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. Defendant was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for the aggravated discharge of a firearm convictions and three years' imprisonment for the aggravated unlawful use of a weapon convictions. Defendant was assessed a $ 5 court system fee. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6 was unconstitutional as violating U.S. Const. amend. II. The court of appeals disagreed. The holdings upon which defendant relied were limited to the question presented - the right to possess a commonly used firearm, a handgun, in the home for self-defense purposes. In the instant case, defendant was carrying the loaded firearm in his vehicle and shot at a person. Defendant also argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain one conviction for aggravated discharge of a firearm. The court of appeals disagreed. The officer identified defendant as one of the shooters in the second shooting and corroborated much of the victim's disavowed testimony as to that event. Further, physical evidence linked both shootings to the handguns, shell casings and bullets that were found at the scene of the second shooting, in the car and in the victim's vehicle. Further, defendant was identified as one of the men holding a gun at the second shooting and discarding the guns through the window. That corroborating evidence provided support sufficient to support the victim's disavowed statement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The $ 5 court system fee and defendant's convictions under counts III and VII were vacated. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. The trial court sentenced him to 20 years' imprisonment. Defendant's motion to reconsider the sentence was denied, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in admitting evidence concerning defendant's prior conviction for aggravated criminal sexual abuse under 725 ILCS 5/115-7.3. The court of appeals disagreed. There were general areas of similarity between the two crimes. The two victims were female and were in the same age range of 12 to 14 years old. Defendant was significantly older than each of the girls; he was almost 20 when he assaulted the prior complainant and 23 when he committed the charged offense against the victim. Both girls had problems with their home lives; the prior complainant described herself as a &quot;runaway&quot; and a &quot;runner,&quot; while evidence indicated that the victim had not attended school on at least one occasion, prompting her mother to inform the police. Both began as consensual encounters, and both involved vaginal penetration. Defendant's closing argument reduced the prejudicial value of the evidence because defense counsel specifically asked the jury not to give the prior conviction any weight. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of defendant's prior conviction for aggravated criminal sexual abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed an amended charge of discrimination against the employer alleging it issued two written reprimands against him despite him satisfactorily performing his duties as a warehouse worker fulfilling customer orders. He claimed that he received the reprimands due to his race, African-American, and his age, 55, in violation of the Illinois Human Rights Acts, 775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (2004) (Act). The state human rights department investigated and found that he failed to present substantial evidence supporting his charge. Eventually, the chief legal counsel sustained the department's finding. The appellate court found that the employee did not present substantial evidence and, thus, did not show that the chief legal counsel's decision was an abuse of discretion. It determined that the employee did not show that either reprimand resulted in an adverse employment action against him or that similarly-situated workers not in the protected classes had been treated differently. It also held that he waived his claim that the 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2) (2004) substantial evidence standard was unconstitutionally vague because he did not show that it implicated First Amendment concerns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the decision of the chief legal counsel of the state human rights department sustaining the department's decision to dismiss the employee's discrimination charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Du Page County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a judgment that dismissed plaintiff widow's claim against defendant attorney for alleged legal malpractice in the drafting of a deed to real property that her late husband allegedly intended to convey to her as his joint tenant. It did so after finding the claim to be barred by the statute of repose, 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3(c) (1994). The widow appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow's late husband, shortly after they were married, retained the attorney to draft a deed to the premises where the widow and late husband lived to make him and the widow co-owners in joint tenancy with rights of survivorship. The attorney prepared a quitclaim deed that, by its terms, conveyed title to the premises from the late husband to the late husband and widow in joint tenancy. The next month, the attorney recorded the deed. More than 10 years after the deed was drafted and recorded, the late husband died. The widow then determined that the quitclaim deed conveyed nothing to her because the late husband did not hold title to the premises but merely held the beneficial interest in a land trust that did. She sued the attorney for legal malpractice about two months after the late husband died. The trial court found that the six-year statute of repose, 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3(c) (1994), applied and dismissed her claim. The appellate court disagreed and determined that she merely had to file within two years of the late husband's death pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3 (1994) because the late husband could have corrected the problem at any time up to the time of his death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction entered by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for first degree murder and home invasion. Defendant was sentenced to 60 years in prison. A prior decision was modified upon rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that his sentence should be vacated because the State's notice of intent to seek the death penalty was not filed until 247 days after his arraignment, rather than 120 days, in violation of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 416(c). Defendant's motion to strike the notice had been denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The issue was not moot because although a death sentence was not imposed, if the trial court had found defendant was not eligible for the death penalty, it might have sentenced defendant to less than 60 years in prison, and the instant court could remand for resentencing. Because Rule 416 contained no negative language prohibiting the State from pursuing the death penalty in the absence of a timely filed notice, the rule was directory as no specific consequence was triggered by the failure to comply. Reversal was not mandated because the rights intended to be protected were actually protected in defendant's case as he was provided with additional attorneys who specialized in death penalty cases and received additional peremptory challenges and permission to life qualify the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and remanded the matter with directions to vacate, with the State's agreement, the $ 5 court system fee, the $ 10 mental health court assessment, the $ 5 youth diversion/peer court assessment, the $ 5 drug court assessment, and the $ 25 court supervision assessment and to amend the fines and fees order to reflect a reduction in the total amount of $ 50.</SPAN></P>

There were clear criteria set forth for deciding the case under 65 ILCS 5/11-61-2 (2004), and there was no deference given to the legislative enactments of the units of local government. There was no abuse of discretion in denying the district's discovery requests because the material sought was not relevant. Next, the taking was authorized by 65 ILCS 5/11-61-2 (2004). The village was permitted to use the property to expand its facilities. Holding the property for a future use or for an investment did not constitute a &quot;use already existing&quot; within the meaning of 65 ILCS 5/11-61-2 (2004). There was no error in the trial court's finding that the taking was not detrimental to the public.

The State charged defendant with first degree murder and claimed that defendant shook the child to death. Defendant claimed that the death was due to brain damage from a seizure. Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of that charge. The trial court then imposed a mandatory life sentence. Defendant claimed on appeal that inculpatory statements he made to police should have been suppressed, that the State did not prove the requisite mental state necessary to convict, and that the sentence was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that defendant's inculpatory statements were properly admitted, as he did not show he made an unambiguous request for counsel to be present during questioning, as was required by the Fifth Amendment. It also found that the State proved under 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(2) (2004) that defendant knew his conduct in shaking the child created a strong probability of great bodily harm. Finally, it found that because the sentence of life imprisonment violated the Illinois Constitution's single-subject clause, defendant had to be resentenced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed, inter alia, that trial counsel was ineffective and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for possession of handgun ammunition. On appeal, the court affirmed. A video obtained by a confidential informant (CI) while he was present in defendant's trailer did not require a warrant under U.S. Const. amend. IV or Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 as defendant had no constitutionally protected privacy interest in any activity that the CI viewed while in his home. A search warrant application was not deficient because the CI's affidavit indicated that he had seen hydrocodone pills inside defendant's home within 72 hours of filing and had purchased prescription narcotic pills from defendant in the past. Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to stipulate to defendant's prior conviction as the prior burglary conviction was over 30 years old at the time of trial and there was little danger that he was convicted based on an improper propensity inference. The statutory definition of firearm ammunition in 430 ILCS 65/1.1 (2006) did not require proof that the ammunition was live but only that it was designed to be used or adaptable to use in a firearm.</SPAN></P>

Nevertheless, he forced his way in to her ninth-floor apartment. They struggled; she then fell out a bedroom window to her death. The State filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty 247 days after he was arraigned. The trial court denied defense counsel's subsequently-filed motion to strike the notice as untimely under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 416(c). A jury then convicted defendant on first degree murder and home invasion charges, and he was sentenced to 60 years in prison, The appellate court then rejected challenges to the denial of the motion to strike. As a preliminary matter, it disagreed with the State that defendant could not make those challenges. It then found that while the language of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 416(c) was directory rather than mandatory, that rule still made it a mandatory obligation that the notice of intent be filed within 120 days of arraignment. However, it also found that the failure to comply was only one factor for the trial court to consider in determining whether the notice should be stricken, and that defendant could not show that he was prejudiced by the late filing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 25-years-old and the young victim was five-years-old at the time that defendant, the boyfriend of the young victim's mother, allegedly placed his mouth on her vagina.

He challenged whether 725 ILCS 5/115-10 (2008), allowing for a videotaped interview of the young victim discussing the abuse, was constitutional, whether the trial court erred in admitting it under that statute, whether the evidence proved him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and whether he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The appellate court found that (1) the statute, presumed to be constitutional, was not shown to be facially unconstitutional; (2) the videotape was properly admitted since the young victim meaningfully testified and was available for cross-examination; (3) the jury could have found him guilty of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt; and (4) he did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel since his trial counsel could not have successfully argued that the videotape was inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1988 the petitioner pled guilty to various offenses in two cases in exchange for the State's sentence recommendation. After admonishing the petitioner, the trial court accepted the petitioner's guilty plea and sentenced him in accordance with the plea agreement. The appellate court ruled that the petitioner's 735 ILCS 5/2-1401(f) (2006) petition did not set forth any allegation that the trial court lacked personal or subject matter jurisdiction. Although the entry of a judgment on multiple convictions in violation of the one-act/one-crime rule constituted error, it did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction, and the erroneous judgment was merely voidable, not void. The petition failed to set forth any cognizable claim that the petitioner's convictions and sentences were void. Also, the State fully performed its obligations under the plea agreement. The petitioner did not argue that the trial court's failure to admonish him regarding mandatory supervised release denied him due process or the benefit of his plea bargain. Caselaw did not suggest that the failure to admonish a defendant regarding mandatory supervised release deprived the trial court of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was arrested for driving with a license that had been revoked because of a prior driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) conviction. His vehicle was seized and subsequently forfeited. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court noted that the trial court considered mitigating factors and still concluded that a forfeiture was warranted. Moreover, there was nothing that required the trial court to consider mitigating evidence in determining the propriety of a vehicle forfeiture. The trial court's ruling was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Next, the forfeiture of the vehicle did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The forfeiture of the vehicle in this case was not grossly disproportionate to the offense of driving on a revoked license. Driving with a revoked license that stemmed from a DUI conviction was one of the most serious driving offenses that could have been committed absent bodily injury. A forfeiture of personal property was less harsh than a forfeiture of real property, and a forfeiture of a vehicle worth more than the owner's had been previously upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Lake County, Illinois, defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, 720 ILCS 570/401(c)(2) (2006), a Class 1 felony. Defendant was sentenced under the habitual offender statute as a Class X offender, 730 ILCS 5/5-5-3(c)(8) (2006), and a fee for reimbursement of court-appointed counsel was imposed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man were walking on a path when they were ordered to approach a squad car. The two men veered off the path into the bushes and then emerged and approached the officers. Cocaine was found in the bushes and on defendant's person. The court found that the amount of time that had passed and the proximity of defendant to the bushes rendered reasonable the inference that defendant possessed the cocaine. Defendant abandoned the drugs before he was seized. He was not seized until he returned to the path, approached the squad car, and submitted to the order. The allegedly unlawful seizure at the time of submission did not result in the recovery of any evidence. Thus, the arrest based on the drugs found during the perimeter search was proper, and the search incident to that arrest was valid. There was no error in preventing defense counsel from using a whiteboard as demonstrative evidence during cross-examination. Because defendant was sentenced as a Class X offender based on his criminal history, he was subject to a mandatory supervised release term of three years; his sentence of 14 years' imprisonment plus a three-year term of mandatory supervised release was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed except as to the reimbursement order, which it vacated and remanded for a hearing on defendant's ability to pay for the services of his court-appointed attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee village filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois), for authorization pursuant to &sect; 11-31-1(a) of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/11-31-1(a) (2006), to demolish an apartment building that was owned by appellant property owner. The trial court issued an order authorizing the village to demolish the owner's building. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that the trial court erred in finding that the owner's building was dangerous and unsafe under the Illinois Municipal Code, because it erred in finding that the owner could not reasonably repair the building and because the village did not provide the notice which the Code required. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in concluding that the building was dangerous and unsafe under 65 ILCS 5/11-31-1(a). Further, the trial court did not err by consulting a village ordinance to set the Code's standard for determining whether repair to the building could not be reasonably accomplished. Furthermore, because the damage to the building exceeded the village ordinance's 50 percent standard, repairs were forbidden and thus not reasonable. However, the record did not reveal whether proper notice was given to any lienholders, as required by &sect; 11-31-1(a), but the village did not dispute the owner's assertion that it was not. Therefore, vacation of the trial court's demolition order and remand for the trial court to make further determinations was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated, and the matter was remanded for the trial court to determine whether there were any lienholders, and, if so, whether they were notified. If there was no deficiency in notification, the court could reenter its demolition order, but if there was inadequate notice to a lienholder, the court had to ensure proper notice and hear the lienholder's objections, if any, before entering (or declining to enter) a demolition order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a husband and his wife, appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of the 13th Judicial Circuit La Salle County, Illinois, which dismissed their amended petition for discovery pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 224 that sought disclosure from respondent publisher of identifying information concerning the persons responsible for certain comments posted on the publisher's web site, which petitioners alleged were defamatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several online posts to an article on the publisher's web site stated that petitioners had bribed the town's planning commissioners. The trial court adopted a test known as the Dendrite-Cahill test, and found that petitioners had not satisfied the hypothetical summary judgment test because the literary and social context of the statements rendered them nonactionable opinions as a matter of law. The court disagreed and held that subjecting an Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 224 petition to the same level of scrutiny afforded the sufficiency of a complaint pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-615 would address any constitutional concerns arising from disclosing the identity of any potential defendant. Although certain types of anonymous speech were constitutionally protected, it was overly broad to assert that anonymous speech, in and of itself, warranted constitutional protection and anonymous Internet speakers did not enjoy a higher degree of protection from claims of defamation than the private individual who had a cause of action against him for defamation. Petitioners stated a cause of action for defamation sufficient to warrant the anonymous individuals to come forward and answer a complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded for entry of an order granting the petition for disclosure pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 224.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The detainee was convicted of multiple counts of rape and sentenced to a number of concurrent terms of imprisonment. Just before his release from prison, petitioner State filed a petition pursuant to the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 ILCS 207/1 et seq. (2008) (Act), seeking to have him adjudicated a sexually violent person and committed to the care and custody of state human services agency. After a hearing that included the testimony of mental health expert witnesses, the trial court denied the request and declined to hold a trial. The appellate court found that the trial court's ruling was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, as the detainee had refused to participate in formal sexual offender treatment and had disagreed that he needed it. It also found that the disorder that the detainee had, &quot;paraphilia NOS, nonconsent&quot; met the requirements under the Act of being a valid disorder for which the detainee could be involuntarily committed, despite the fact that the disorder was not specifically named in a leading diagnostic manual, as the testimony of mental health expert witnesses identified is a valid disorder even if it was not named in that manual.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Du Page County Circuit Court (Illinois), in a condemnation case, granted summary judgment for plaintiff condemnor on whether the condemnor negotiated in good faith before suing and on a motion in limine to bar evidence. It then denied defendant condemnees' motion for a posttrial hearing to determine fair market value as of the time the jury set a &quot;fair market value&quot; figure, which was eight years after the action was filed. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condemnor decided to acquire some land that the condemnees had acquired years before. It notified the condemnees, offered to pay a certain sum, and gave the condemnees time to respond. The condemnees rejected the initial offer. The condemnor then filed a condemnation complaint. The trial court granted summary judgment to the condemnor on acting-in-good-faith and motion in limine issues. It declined the condemnees' request for a post-hearing valuation. After eight years passed from the filing of the case, the jury determined a &quot;fair market value&quot; figure, as of the date the condemnation case was filed. The appellate court found that (1) summary judgment was properly awarded to the condemnor on the good-faith and motion in limine issues, as the record showed it made an offer in-line with appraisal valuations and an annexation agreement would have barred further development of the land; and (2) a post-trial hearing should have been held on whether the substantial delay in rendering a verdict on the land's &quot;fair market value&quot; deprived the condemnees of Fifth Amendment just compensation, as use of a traditional &quot;time-of-filing&quot; valuation might be unconstitutional given the delay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's granting of summary judgment in favor of the condemnor on the issue of whether it engaged in good-faith negotiations and the granting of its motion in limine. It vacated the jury's verdict setting forth the value of the property, which was subject to possible reinstatement by the trial court after a just compensation hearing. It also remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of three counts of child abduction and sentenced to six-year terms of imprisonment for each conviction, with two of the terms to be served consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of his three convictions for attempted sexual assault because the evidence served only to demonstrate to the jury his propensity to commit crime. The court of appeals agreed. The prosecution's written motion for admission of defendant's prior crimes did not suggest similarities between those crimes and the alleged child abduction offense. Defendant's prior crimes involved attacks made by force upon adult women he followed from bars late at night. They offered no insight on his intentions in offering rides to elementary school girls from his car in broad daylight other than to show his propensity to commit sex crimes. Indeed, the prosecution's focus on defendant's propensity was demonstrated at trial by its reconsideration motion's invocation of his &quot;sexually deviant background.&quot; Defendant's earlier crimes were not sufficiently similar to the child abduction charges to permit those crimes to establish his intent other than by demonstrating his propensity to commit sexual offenses. Therefore, the trial court committed reversible error in admitting the prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that (1) the cyberstalking statute,&nbsp;720 ILCS 5/12-7.5(a)(1) (2008), did not violate his First Amendment rights since it targeted knowing conduct occurring without lawful justification and, thus, was neither overbroad nor vague; (2) the cyberstalking and harassment through electronic communication convictions involved the same conduct, meaning they violated the one-act, one-crime rule and that the harassment conviction had to be vacated; (3) the State proved him guilty of cyberstalking and stalking beyond a reasonable doubt; and (4) the trial court made a proper inquiry into his pro se ineffective assistance of counsel claims before declining to appoint new counsel to pursue them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Sangamon County, Illinois, granted the motion of defendants, state officials, for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs', non-profit corporation and member, motion to reconsider on their suit against the state officials barring the transfer of funds from a number of funds, including the Cycle Rider Safety Training Fund (CRST Fund), to the General Revenue Fund. The non-profit and member appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that because the monies in the CRST Fund were private, the legislature could not transfer the monies pursuant to the 2004 and 2005 budget implementations (BIMP) without violating the takings clauses of the Illinois and United States Constitutions. The appellate court noted that the collected and placed into the CRST Fund were fees charged by the State for the privilege of operating a motorcycle. They were not from the sale of a private corporation's assets with the proceeds being used, at the State's direction, to create a foundation or trust. Because there was no evidence that any private monies were transferred from the CRST Fund to the General Revenue Fund, plaintiffs could not show any private money was taken. The legislature had the authority to enact the 2004 and 2005 BIMPs that enabled the transfer of funds. The Illinois legislature, by enacting the 1992 amendments to the Cycle Rider Safety Training Act (Act), 625 ILCS 35/6 (1992), did not create an irrevocable trust and therefore had the authority to transfer funds. The legislative enactments showed that the legislature intended to authorize the transfer of CRST Fund monies into the General Revenue Fund.</SPAN></P>

The beneficiaries appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trust grantor hired the law firm to handle the trust grantor's estate plan. The law firm, with the accounting firm's help, prepared the trust grantor's trust and will. Too, the accounting firm provided financial and accounting services for estate planning purposes to the trust grantor. After the trust grantor died, the accounting firm retained the bank to act as a co-executor and co-trustee of the will and trust. The trust beneficiaries then sued the law firm, accounting firm, and bank alleging the mishandling of the trust grantor's estate plan. The trial court, pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-615 (2008) and 735 ILCS 5/2-619 (2008), dismissed nine counts of the original complaint, first amended complaint, and second amended complaint. The appellate court found that (1) as to the original complaint, the trust beneficiaries could not challenge the will's validity because they did not file their challenge within 755 ILCS 5/8-1 (2008)'s six-month time period; (2) the trust beneficiaries did not show any negligence occurred in implementing the trust grantor's intent; and (3) the trust beneficiaries lacked standing to challenge the services that were provided to the trust grantor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Vermilion County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered final judgments of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of armed robbery with a firearm and armed violence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with, inter alia, armed robbery with a firearm and armed violence with a category I weapon predicated on the offense of robbery after he used a gun to rob a pizza delivery man. A jury found him guilty of armed robbery with a firearm and armed violence. The trial court sentenced him to 15 years in prison on his armed violence conviction. He alleged on appeal that (1) his trial counsel was ineffective for eliciting testimony from defendant about a prior juvenile conviction, and (2) the armed violence sentence violated the Illinois Constitution's proportionate penalties clause. The appellate court found that under 705 ILCS 405/5-150(1)(c) (2008), he could be impeached with a juvenile adjudication and, thus, his counsel prudently made the jury aware of it before the State did so. Next, it found his armed violence sentence, which had to be for at least 15 years due to 720 ILCS 5/18-2(b) (2006)'s mandatory enhancement for using a handgun, was harsher than the sentence for armed robbery with a firearm despite the offenses having identical elements. It thus concluded that the armed violence violated the proportionate penalties clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded his case to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business owners filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants, the director of the Department of Labor and the Illinois Attorney General. The Circuit Court of Franklin County (Illinois) denied plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) preventing defendants from enforcing the Illinois Employee Classification Act, 820 ILCS 185/1 et seq., against them. Plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed that the Act violated the Illinois Constitution and the United States Constitution and thus was unenforceable. The court first held that the issues plaintiffs raised were ripe for judicial decision under 735 ILCS 5/2-701(a) (2008). They were basically legal in nature, i.e., whether the Act was constitutionally valid, and a sufficient hardship existed to make judicial review appropriate. The court held that the trial court erred in denying the TRO request. Plaintiffs' procedural due process claim presented a fair question concerning plaintiffs' right to relief, since the Department's fact-finding investigations and enforcement sanctions under the Act appeared to fall outside the procedural protections normally afforded to persons subject to administrative investigations and administrative penalties. Plaintiffs alleged that immediate and irreparable harm to their business's relationships with its subcontractors would occur without a TRO, due to the threat of a $1.6 million penalty and the uncertainty of the pending investigations. Because of the potential harm to plaintiffs' businesses, they had an inadequate remedy at law. Thus, a TRO was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order denying plaintiffs' motion for a TRO. It remanded with directions for the trial court to enter a TRO enjoining the Department from enforcing the Act against the plaintiffs until the trial court could conduct a hearing on plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff personal representative brought an action under the Survival Act, 755 ILCS 5/27-6 (2006), against defendant nursing home operator. The Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) granted defendant's motion to strike plaintiff's reservation of the right to request punitive damages on the basis that it did not survive the decedent's death. Plaintiff filed an interlocutory appeal, and the court was asked to answer a certified question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, answering the certified question in the negative, held that common-law punitive damages were not available in a survival action brought under the Nursing Home Care Act (&quot;Act&quot;), 210 ILCS 45/1-101 et seq. (2006). There was no statutory basis for punitive damages. Case law reflected that the Act &quot;authorized&quot; punitive damages only in the sense that it did not preclude a plaintiff from pursuing other available causes of action in addition to those that were available under the Act. The legislative history of the repeal of the Act's treble damages provision clearly reflected that while the Act previously included an express provision for punitive damages, it no longer did. Furthermore, the Illinois Supreme Court had not created an equitable-considerations exception permitting recovery of punitive damages under the Survival Act. Even if such an exception existed, it did not apply here. The Act provided for a range of both civil and criminal penalties for violations thereof. Furthermore, it would be inappropriate for the court to conclude that equity required punitive damages availability in light of the legislature's repeal of the treble damages provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question in the negative. It remanded the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an attorney and a party litigant, filed suit against defendants, the Illinois State Comptroller and Treasurer. Plaintiffs prevailed on their claim that funds were unlawfully transferred from the Lawyers Assistance Program (LAP) and the Mandatory Arbitration Fund (MAF) into the state's general revenue fund, but the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied a permanent injunction, interest, and attorney fees. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Illinois Attorney General was not under a duty to withdraw as defendants' counsel. The Attorney General was deemed to have a conflict of interest only where she was interested as a private individual or was an actual party. Furthermore, plaintiffs had not shown that the Attorney General was under any legal obligation to provide or secure representation for any part of the judicial branch where, as here, no such entity was named as a party to the litigation. The trial court did not err in refusing to order that any interest accrued on the swept funds while in the general revenue fund be deposited with the LAP and MAF. Under 30 ILCS 105/4.1(a) (2006), interest on fees was to be deposited into the general revenue fund. Plaintiffs had not shown that the disposition of interest unduly infringed upon inherent judicial powers under Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 or unconstitutionally burdened access to the courts. Finally, expenses in civil litigation against the State was a subject matter in which the Court of Claims was given exclusive jurisdiction. Thus, the court lacked jurisdiction over plaintiffs' attorney fee claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Williamson County Circuit Court (Illinois) dismissed plaintiff companies' complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and a temporary restraining order, after they challenged a law allowing defendant county to impose a tax for school facility use, the validity of county ordinances imposing it that county, and the validity of defendant state agency's filing certificate regarding one ordinance. The companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois legislature enacted the County School Facility Occupation Tax Law (School Facility Tax Law), 55 ILCS 5/5-1006.7 (Supp. 2007). The School Facility Tax Law allowed Illinois counties to impose a countywide retailers' occupation tax and a service occupation tax, the retail sales tax, at a rate of one percent, to be used exclusively for school facility purposes. Pursuant to the School Facility Tax Law, defendant Boards passed a similar resolution requesting that the county submit to the voters the question of imposing a one percent sales tax for school facility purposes. The county did so. The voters in an election voted for the county having the authority to impose the sales tax. The county passed ordinances that would allow for it to implement the tax. The companies claimed in an amended complaint that they were subject to the tax, which was unconstitutional as applied. The trial court granted a motion to dismiss the companies' amended complaint. The appellate court found that the companies had standing to challenge imposition of the tax, as they both alleged that they were retailers who were subject to the tax and, thus, that they were personally affected by it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two decedents were killed when a small plane owned and piloted by the one decedent crashed, allegedly because an inadequate fuel gauge  led to propeller problems. It filed strict product liability and negligence claims against the manufacturer and seller of both the plane and its component parts. It also asserted breach of warranty claims against the one seller. The trial court dismissed the product liability claims against the one seller, and otherwise granted summary judgment to the manufacturers and sellers. The appellate court fond that it lacked jurisdiction to review the appeal of the personal representative about the ruling dismissing the product liability claims, as dismissal under 735 ILCS 5/2-621 (1994), the Illinois distributor statute, was not a final and appealable order given the possibility of further action in the trial court. It also held that genuine issues of material fact barred the summary judgment grant to the one seller on the negligence and breach of implied warranty claims. However, it found that the General Aviation Revitalization Act, with its 18-year statute of repose, protected the remaining manufacturers and sellers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kane County Circuit Court (Illinois), in three separate cases, rejected each appellant claimant's contentions that the property forfeiture provisions of the Criminal Code of 1961, 720 ILCS 5/36-1 et seq. (2008), were unconstitutional for not including a provision for a prompt &quot;probable cause&quot; hearing. It then ordered that the relevant vehicle in each case be forfeited.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three separate cases, the county state's attorney filed a complaint for forfeiture and alleged that claimant's vehicle was subject to forfeiture. In each case, the claimant argued in the trial court that the property-forfeiture provisions of the Criminal Code of 1961, 720 ILCS 5/36-1 et seq. (2008), were unconstitutional because they did not include a provision for a prompt &quot;probable cause&quot; hearing. In each case, the trial court rejected the claimant's constitutional argument and ordered his vehicle forfeited. The appellate court first noted that the statute was presumed to be constitutional and the claimant in each case had the burden of overcoming that presumption. It then found that none of them was able to do so. It determined that the procedure accorded to the claimants in each case in the trial court comported with due process such that no additional procedures were required. The appellate court determined that the hearings complied with Barker for determining whether there was an undue delay and found that no such delay was shown. It then found that the law dictated that a forfeiture proceeding that met the Barker test satisfied due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 21st Judicial Circuit Court, Iroquois County (Illinois), granted summary judgment to defendant recreational vehicle manufacturer after plaintiff recreational vehicle dealer filed suit against the manufacturer and alleged that the manufacturer violated the Illinois Motor Vehicle Franchise Act, 815 ILCS 710/1 et seq. (2008), in its business dealings with the dealer. The dealer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer and dealer entered into an agreement, the first contract, authorizing the dealer to sell one of the manufacturer's products. As the first contract was about to expire, the manufacturer sent the dealer a second contract. It did not define the dealer's sales territory, have an expiration date, or list sales goals. The dealer refused to sign it. The dealer entered into a new written contract, the third contract, with the manufacturer, which contained some similarities and some differences to the first contract. The manufacturer then located another dealer about 90 miles from the dealer's franchise location. The dealer claimed that the manufacturer's conduct violated the Illinois Motor Vehicle Franchise Act, 815 ILCS 710/1 et seq. (2008). The trial court, however, granted the manufacturer's summary judgment motion. The appellate court found that the manufacturer did not violate that statute because, (1) under 815 ILCS 710/4(e)(8) (2008), it did not have to give notice of the location of a new franchise because the new franchise was not within the relevant market area and (2) the manufacturer did not engage in any conduct prohibited by 815 ILCS 710/4(d)(6) (2008).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a judgment that adjudicated respondent juvenile delinquent on two counts of aggravated battery. The juvenile appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim and the juvenile scuffled. The juvenile then struck the victim such that the victim had to get stitches. The State charged the juvenile with two counts of aggravated battery, one count being based upon 720 ILCS 5/12-4(a) (2004), for causing great bodily harm, and the other count being based on 720 ILCS 5/12-4(b)(8) (2004), for causing harm to a victim on a public way. After a hearing, the trial court adjudicated her delinquent. It then sentenced her to five years of probation and ordered her to submit a DNA indexing sample. The appellate court found that (1) the State proved her delinquent beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the juvenile did not lay a proper foundation for admission of testimony about the victim; (3) the one-act, one-crime rule applied to juvenile cases and, thus, she could only be found delinquent on one of the two aggravated battery charges, requiring a remand to determine which charge should be vacated; (4) her probation sentence could not extend beyond her 21st birthday; and (5) 730 ILCS 5/5-3-4 (2004), making it mandatory that she submit a DNA sample, was not facially unconstitutional under either the Fourth Amendment or Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment, but remanded the case to the trial court with directions to vacate one of the findings of delinquency, to correct the &quot;Trial Order,&quot; and to modify the juvenile's probation to terminate on her 21st birthday, on a specified date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) denied defendant majority shareholder's motion to dismiss plaintiff minority shareholders' amended complaint alleging in regard to a merger and sale transaction that the majority shareholders mistreated them and forced them to accept an inadequate payment for their shares. It then certified a question about whether the three-year limitations period of 815 ILCS 5/13(D) (2008) applied to the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minority shareholders filed an amended complaint against the majority shareholder, and asserted breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against the majority shareholder stemming from the majority shareholder's alleged conduct during a merger and sale transaction. The minority shareholders claimed that they were mistreated and forced to sell their shares for inadequate value. Since the minority shareholders filed suit four years after the alleged misconduct, the majority shareholders claimed that their action was barred under the Illinois Securities Law's three-year limitations period set forth in 815 ILCS 5/13(D) (2008). The trial court disagreed and found that the lawsuit was governed by the residual five-year limitations period of 735 ILCS 5/13-205 (2008). The appellate court, on the trial court's certified question, found that 815 ILCS 5/13(D) (2008) did not apply to bar the minority shareholders' lawsuit against the majority shareholders. It so concluded because it found that 815 ILCS 5/13 (2008) did not concern retroactive common law damages claims for breach of fiduciary duty brought by sellers of securities in general, or minority shareholders in particular.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court answered the trial court's certified question in the negative and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

In the second case, the property owners sued the hospitals and claimed that hospital property was being illegally used while the hospitals claimed that the IPD ordinance passed by the city council validly permitted the use. The trial court found the ordinances of the city, a home rule unit, that were used to approve the hospitals' IPD were valid. The appellate court found that despite the nearby property owners claiming violation of their constitutional rights pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/11-13-25 (2006), involving zoning decisions, they were actually seeking a finding that ordinances should be invalidated for the city's failure to follow its own self-imposed regulations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Winnebago County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a judgment that denied defendant nursing home operators' motion to enforce an arbitration provision after plaintiff nursing home resident sued them for relief under the Nursing Home Care Act, 210 ILCS 45/1-101 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident sued the operators for relief under the Nursing Home Care Act, 210 ILCS 45/1-101 et seq. (2006) (Care Act), and for negligence for wrongful injuries she said she suffered while she was cared for at their long-term care facility. The operators answered her complaint and moved for enforcement of an arbitration provision contained in the written agreement that was signed so that she could become a resident at the facility. The trial court denied the motion to enforce. The appellate court found that the policy favoring arbitration set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2 (FAA), was in direct conflict with provisions of the Care Act, namely, 210 ILCS 45/3-606 (2006) and 210 ILCS 45/3-607 (2006), that purported to nullify the arbitration provision in the nursing home admission agreement. It then found that pursuant to the supremacy clause contained in the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, the FAA preempted the Care Act regarding the enforceability of the arbitration provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered an adjudication that found respondent juvenile to be delinquent for the offense of aggravated battery. The juvenile appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim and the juvenile got into a confrontation. The juvenile pummeled the victim to the point where the victim had to get stitches. As a result, the State filed a petition charging the juvenile with two counts of aggravated battery, based upon 720 ILCS 5/12-4(a) (2004), causing great bodily harm, and 720 ILCS 5/12-4(b)(8) (2004), causing harm to a victim on a public way. The trial court later adjudicated her delinquent. It then sentenced her to five years of probation and ordered her to submit a sample for DNA indexing. The appellate court found that (1) the State proved her delinquent beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the juvenile did not lay a proper foundation for admission testimony about the victim; (3) the one-act, one-crime rule applied to juvenile proceedings and, thus, the juvenile could only be found delinquent on one of the two aggravated assault charges, requiring a remand to determine which charge should be vacated; (4) her probation sentence could not extend beyond her 21st birthday; and (5) 730 ILCS 5/5-3-4 (2004), making it mandatory that she submit a DNA sample, was not facially unconstitutional under either the Fourth Amendment or Ill. Const. art. I. &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's adjudication to the extent of ordering that one finding of delinquency be vacated as directed, that the trial court's &quot;Trial Order&quot; be corrected, and that the juvenile's probation be modified such that it be terminated on a specified date.</SPAN></P>

A tie vote of respondent Illinois Board of Elections resulted in the candidate's name remaining on the ballot. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied a petition for administrative review. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate voted a Democratic ballot in a consolidated primary election and later voted in a general township election in April 2009. In October 2009, he filed his nomination papers as a Republican party candidate in the 2010 Republican primary. The court stated that restrictions on candidates' party-switching had not been held unconstitutional.&nbsp;10 ILCS 5/8-8 (2006), however, no longer provided express time limitations on party-switching for candidates; the only remaining restriction was that the candidate had to be a qualified primary voter. Apart from the basic age and residency requirements contained therein, 10 ILCS 5/7-43 (2006) had very limited requirements for primary voting, including declaring party affiliation and refraining from participating in the opposing party's activities within 45 days of the primary. If &sect; 7-43 was accorded with the other relevant restrictions on primary voting found in &sect; 8-8, that a &quot;qualified primary elector&quot; of a party could not sign petitions or be a candidate of more than one party, then the candidate had declared affiliation and was a qualified primary voter of the Republican Party. Thus, his statement of candidacy was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying the petition and confirmed the Board's decision that the candidate could remain on the primary ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a substance containing cocaine. The Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) had denied his motion to suppress evidence seized during a search of his home on the ground that under the United States Supreme Court's decision in Hudson, the exclusionary rule did not apply. Defendant appealed. He argued that the evidence should be excluded under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the search violated the knock-and-announce rule of U.S. Const. amend. IV. In Hudson, the United States Supreme Court had held that the federal exclusionary rule did not apply to violations of the knock-and-announce rule. Because the Illinois Supreme Court had with limited exceptions construed &sect; 6 in &quot;lockstep&quot; with the United States Supreme Court's construction of the Fourth Amendment, the trial court declined to find that &sect; 6 required suppression. The court stated that it would not expand the state exclusionary remedy beyond the federal one unless (1) the framers of the 1970 constitution intended the expansion; or (2) denying the expansion would be antithetical to state tradition and values as reflected by long-standing case precedent. Here, because the state exclusionary rule was a judicially created remedy, the language of &sect; 6 did not show anything, and the framers had not discussed the exclusionary rule. Moreover, the narrow exception that the Illinois Supreme Court had carved to the lockstep doctrine involved legislation authorizing unconstitutional searches and did not support carving out another exception under the very different circumstances here.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a general verdict for them, and awarded both compensatory and punitive damages. The appellate court found that (1) the jury properly considered the negligent design claims, as evidence was admitted that aft-of-the-axle fuel tanks such as was on their vehicle were defective because they tended to rupture in rear-end collisions, causing postcollision fires, that the automobile manufacturer was long aware of that hazard, and that it was negligent in continuing to so design vehicles without at least guarding against the hazard or warning vehicle owners about it; (2) the jury was properly instructed; (3) not submitting the automobile manufacturer's special interrogatories to the jury was not error, as answers to them might still allow for the return of a general verdict; and (4) the evidence supported giving a jury instruction on punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

During the pendency of the case, however, both the statute of limitations and the statute of repose expired. Eventually, the malpractice case itself was dismissed for want of prosecution. Two months later, the former client refiled the case under the Illinois saving statute,&nbsp;735 ILCS 5/13-217 (2008). The trial court, however, found that the refiled suit was barred by the six-year statute of repose for claims of legal malpractice, 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3(c) (2008). The appellate court found that the Illinois saving statute permitting the refiling of certain dismissed actions, such as those for want of prosecution, within one year of the dismissal created an exception to the statute of repose for legal malpractice actions, 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3 (2008) and, thus, the former client should have been allowed to maintain his refiled action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state natural resources agency filed five separate cases in the trial court involving oil wells operated by the operator. The trial court in each case agreed with administrative proceedings that found the wells had been abandoned. In each case, the operator then raised issues concerning the alleged lack of notice given to the operator regarding the hearings. The trial court eventually dismissed the operator's claims. The appellate court found that (1) the state natural resources agency's settlement offer in two cases was too indefinite to be enforced under contract law; (2) the trial court lost jurisdiction over one of the cases after entering a final judgment dismissing it with prejudice, which became an adjudication on the merits under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 273, and res judicata barred the operator from relitigating an alleged lack of notice involving a second well; (3) a finding that the operator received sufficient notice of the proceedings concerning two wells was not against the manifest weight of the evidence; and (4) a separate lawsuit was not sufficiently related to the current case such that the trial court was required to recuse itself under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 63(C).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 12th Judicial Circuit Court, Will County (Illinois), entered a final judgment of conviction after a jury found defendant had violated the Smoke Free Illinois Act, 410 ILCS 82/15 (2008). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers from the forum county's health department observed defendant smoking in a forum county tavern. Defendant was then issued a ticket that charged her with violating 410 ILCS 82/15 (2008), known as the Smoke Free Act, which banned smoking in specified places. Following a jury trial, she was found guilty of violating that law, and was ordered to pay a fine and submit to court supervision. Defendant claimed on appeal that the State could not prosecute alleged violations of the law through criminal proceedings in the trial court. The State claimed that the law did not contain ant language that specifically deprived the trial court of jurisdiction. The appellate court found that the legislature could divest trial courts of original jurisdiction by enacting a comprehensive statutory scheme if it explicitly did so in that scheme. It then found that due to the legislature's mention of the Department of Public Health and enforcing agencies in that law, the legislature had clearly signaled an intent that violations of the law were not to be handled through criminal proceedings in the trial courts, which meant defendant's conviction had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kane County Circuit (Illinois) entered a judgment for defendant city after plaintiff church filed a lawsuit to challenge the city's denial of the church's applications for a site plan review of its proposed new building addition, parking lot, and driveway or, in the alternative, a special use permit for the same improvements to the church's property. The church appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church applied for a site plan review of its proposed new building addition, parking lot, and driveway, or, alternatively, a special use permit for the same improvements. The city denied the applications. The church claimed that the denials were improper. The trial court ruled for the city. The appellate court found that the determination that noncomplying churches could not use the site plan review process, Aurora, Ill., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 5.14, but should submit their application to the special use permit process was not irrational and did not discriminate based on religion. For that reason, the appellate court also concluded that not allowing the church to use the site review plan process did not impose a &quot;substantial burden&quot; on churches or their members in violation of the Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 775 ILCS 35/1 et seq. (2006). However, it also found that the law regarding special permit applications was amended while the case was pending on appeal and, thus, a remand was necessary under the amended law, 65 ILCS 5/11-13-25, to determine whether the city's denial of the special permit application violated the church's substantive due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision that the church could not use the site plan review process and that not allowing such use did not violate the Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It reversed the trial court's judgment affirming the city's denial of the special use permit and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois), in plaintiff personal representative's action against defendant manufacturers and sellers of a plane, and its component parts, asserting strict product liability and negligence claims regarding an airplane crash, dismissed the product liability claims against the one seller. It then granted summary judgment to the manufacturers and sellers on all remaining claims. The personal representative appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two decedents were killed when the small plane owned and piloted by one decedent crashed. The personal representative believed that the crash was caused by an inadequate fuel gauge leading to propeller problems. It asserted strict product liability and negligence claims against the manufacturers and sellers of both the plane and its component parts. It also asserted breach of warranty claims against one seller. The trial court dismissed the product liability claims against the one seller, and granted summary judgment to the defendants on the remaining claims. The appellate court found that it lacked jurisdiction to review the appeal of the personal representative about the ruling dismissing the product liability claims, as the dismissal pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-621 (2006) was not a final and appealable order since further action in the trial court under that statute was possible. It also found that genuine issues of material fact precluded a summary judgment grant to the one seller as to the negligence and breach of implied warranty claims. However, it found that the General Aviation Revitalization Act, with its 18-year statute of repose, protected the remaining defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court dismissed the personal representative's appeal from the trial court's order dismissing its strict liability counts against the one seller. It also reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the one seller on the personal representative's negligence and breach of implied warranty counts. Otherwise, it affirmed the rulings granting summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied the bank's motion for summary judgment and granted the purchaser's cross-motion for summary judgment. The bank appealed. It argued that it never received notice of the sale under the Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/1-1 et seq. (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that the bidder had not made a diligent effort to ascertain the identity of the record owner of the lot. It had never consulted the actual public records to determine the name and address of the party entitled to notice; it had relied upon a tract index; and it did not use a correct legal description of the property. When numerous errors in the process of determining the identity of the record owner of the property resulted in a total lack of notice to the record owner, the record owner was entitled to relief from a tax deed under 35 ILCS 200/22-45(4) (2006). Moreover, this lack of notice was a violation of the bank's right to due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Further, this total lack of notice meant that the circuit court never acquired personal jurisdiction over the bank and that the tax deed was void. The purchaser was not a bona fide purchaser for value under &sect; 2-1401(e). At the time he contracted to buy the property, the sellers did not have a legally recorded ownership interest, and a chain of title inquiry would have placed him on inquiry notice to investigate the tax deed proceeding, which would have disclosed numerous deficiencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment. It remanded the cause with directions for the trial court to set aside the tax deed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State conceded that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the shotgun was modified. The court stated that the mens rea applicable to 720 ILCS 5/24-5(b) (2006) was knowledge. The knowledge required applied only to the possessory component of the offense. The State did not have to prove knowledge of the character of the firearm. Though the defacement bore upon the commission of the offense, it was not an element of the offense. Here, an officer's testimony that he saw defendant carrying the defaced shotgun and placing it inside the door of his home was sufficient to demonstrate his knowing possession of the firearm as well as its unlawful nature. Next, the State's identification testimony was sufficient to prove that defendant was the possessor of the firearm. The officer had a significant opportunity to view defendant and never lost sight of him. There was no lapse between the offense and the identification. Finally, even if defense counsel was ineffective for failing to lay the proper foundation for the admission of a clothing receipt from a jail, defendant had not shown prejudice. The contents of the receipt would have been cumulative of the testimony already offered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's conviction for possession of a modified shotgun. It affirmed the rest of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three separate cases, the State petitioned for the revocation of probation. The first defendant, second defendant, and third defendant moved for dismissal of the respective revocation petitions based on 730 ILCS 5/5-6-4(i) (2008), which established the alternative of intermediate sanctions as a way of avoiding a potential revocation of probation. The trial court granted the respective dismissal motions because the first defendant, second defendant, and third defendant had accepted and completed the sanctions their probation officers had proposed. The State appealed in all three cases, which presented the same question: whether that statute violated the doctrine of separation of powers, Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, by unduly infringing on the executive branch or, more specifically, the State's Attorneys in their function of prosecuting probation violations. The appellate court found that the State had not rebutted the presumption that the statute was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Livingston County Circuit Court (Illinois), in three separate cases, granted the motions to dismiss filed by the first defendant, second defendant, and third defendant, and dismissed the State's respective petitions for revocation of probation. It did so because the defendants in each case had accepted and completed 730 ILCS 5/5-6-4(i) (2008) intermediate sanctions proposed by their probation officers. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three separate cases, the State petitioned for the revocation of probation. The first defendant, second defendant, and third defendant moved for dismissal of the respective revocation petitions based on 730 ILCS 5/5-6-4(i) (2008), which established the alternative of intermediate sanctions as a way to avoid a possible revocation of probation. The trial court granted the respective dismissal motions because the first defendant, second defendant, and third defendant had accepted and completed the sanctions their probation officers had proposed. The State appealed in all three cases, which presented the same question: whether that statute violated the doctrine of separation of powers, Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, by unduly infringing on the executive branch or, more specifically, the State's Attorneys in their function of prosecuting probation violations. The appellate court found that the State had not rebutted the presumption that the statute was constitutional. It so decided based in its finding that granting or denying probation revocation in Illinois had long been a judicial function and the probation officer proposing the intermediate sanctions was a judicial officer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Champaign County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered final judgments of conviction after defendant pleaded guilty to attempted residential burglary in violation of 720 ILCS 5/8-4(a), 19-3(a) (2006), aggravated battery in violation of 720 ILCS 5/12-4(b)(18) (2006), and disarming a peace officer in violation of 720 ILCS 5/31-1a (2006). It then sentenced him. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with multiple offenses due to his attempt to break into a woman's residence and his unsuccessful attempt to take a police officer's weapon. He pled guilty to the offenses, including the offense of 720 ILCS 5/31-1a (2006), disarming a peace officer. On appeal, he argued that 720 ILCS 5/31-1a (2006) impermissibly included conduct constituting both the inchoate and completed offense. The appellate court first found that defendant normally would have been considered to forfeit the issue, Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d), for not raising it earlier. However, it also concluded that he could alternatively relief under the plain error doctrine since the general attempt statute,&nbsp;720 ILCS 5/8-4(a) (2006), could not apply in place of 720 ILCS 5/31-1a (2006). It so determined because it found that 720 ILCS 5/31-1a (2006) contained a manifest legislative intent to exclude application of the general attempt statute through language of &quot;takes or attempts to take.&quot; Accordingly, it also held that he could not show his counsel provided ineffective assistance for not raising the issue of whether the disarming statute could apply instead of the general attempt statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a high-profile entertainer, was charged with having sex with a minor. Before jury selection, the trial court sealed certain pretrial proceedings and records, and, separately, issued a &quot;Decorum Order,&quot; which restrained the speech of attorneys and witnesses. The sealed proceedings concerned mainly two topics: proposed questions for potential jurors, and a motion by the State requesting the trial court for permission to introduce evidence of defendant's other criminal acts. The media intervenors were allowed to intervene, but their motions for access to the closed proceedings and documents, and to vacate the &quot;Decorum Order&quot; were denied. Defendant was then acquitted. The media intervenors claimed violation of their First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The appellate court disagreed and found, inter alia, that (1) a petition to intervene was the proper way to seek relief; (2) appellate court jurisdiction under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 307 was proper to review the denial; (3) the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine applied; (4) the presumption of access did not apply to the pretrial proceedings and documents involved; and (5) the Decorum Order was proper.</SPAN></P>

The defendant claimed on appeal that the trial court should not have refused his request to represent himself and allowed an ineffective interpreter to participate. The appellate disagreed. It found that even assuming he made a knowing and intelligent self-representation request, his right to represent himself pursuant to the Sixth Amendment and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 was not timely made because defendant's appointed counsel at the time of the request already had a long involvement with the case and defendant had already been found guilty. It also found that he forfeited the interpreter issue by not timely objecting. Although he requested Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615(a) plain-error review, the appellate court determined such review would not be proper since the evidence was not closely balanced and any alleged errors by the interpreter did not affect the fairness of his trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Illinois, defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 15 of the Smoke Free Illinois Act (Act), 410 ILCS 82/15 (2008).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, among other things, that the Act was not enforceable through criminal proceedings. The court agreed that the Act was not enforceable through criminal proceedings.

The citation and complaint given to defendant noted, &quot;court appearance required&quot; in the circuit court of Will County and contained no option to summarily pay the fine or contest the citation in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. These facts alone mandated reversal of defendant's conviction. In addition, the language of the Act made clear that the legislature intended that violations of the Act were enforced administratively.

The appellate court found that (1) applicants' first request during the prior year was disapproved for purposes of 415 ILCS 5/39.2(m) (2004) of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (Act) when the Board reversed the city's council's decision on that earlier application on the grounds that the city council erred in finding the proposed landfill met the criterion in 415 ILCS 5/39.2(a)(ii) (2004) of the Act; (2) remand was not necessary to determine whether the  subsequent request was substantially similar to their request from a year earlier because their later request failed to satisfy all of the criteria in 415 ILCS 5/39.2(a) (2004); and (3) the finding that the later application failed to satisfy all of the statutory criteria was dispositive because all of the statutory criteria had to be met for local siting approval.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), defendant was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in violation of 720 ILCS 5/12-16(c)(1)(i) (2002). The present court reversed the conviction and remanded the cause for a new trial. The Supreme Court of Illinois ordered the present court to reconsider the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges involved defendant's four-year-old niece. The court first held that the trial court erred in ruling that the niece was available and that she testified for purposes of 725 ILCS 5/115-10 (2002). She neither made accusations nor gave relevant and material testimony. The niece's inability to answer the single question about alleged abuse--to accuse defendant--led only to the State's ability to bring in other witnesses to testify about what the victim said to them at some other time. If a child did not testify at trial, &sect; 115-10(b)(2)(B) still allowed the introduction of the child's nontestimonial out -of-court statement if there was corroborative evidence of the act which was the subject of the statement. Here, however, there was no corroborative evidence of any act alleged in the niece's statements. The only evidence was the various recitations of the niece's out-of-court statements. Next, one witness had not testified as to what the niece had said but as to what an officer serving as a translator told her the niece had said. In such a case, &sect; 115-10(a)(2) required the State to present the testimony of the person who actually heard the niece's remarks--the translator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On reconsideration, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. It remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with domestic battery in violation of 720 ILCS 5/12-3.2(a)(1) (2006) regarding alleged violence against his girlfriend. At trial, his ex-wife was permitted to testify pursuant to 725 ILCS 5/115-7.4 (Supp. 2007), concerning the admission of evidence of prior acts of domestic abuse, that defendant had physically abused her prior to their marriage. The jury found him guilty. On appeal, he contended that 725 ILCS 5/115-7.4 (Supp. 2007) violated both his constitutional equal protection and due process rights. The appellate court disagreed. It determined that alleged domestic abusers did not constitute a suspect class and, thus, the statute to pass muster under an equal protection clause analysis only had to be rationally based. It found that the statute qualified because domestic abuse crimes often went unreported and such a statute helped to promote the prosecution of such crimes. It also found that the statute did not violate his due process rights because a trial court had to weigh the probative value of the prior acts evidence against its prejudicial effect as a means of excluding such evidence that was unfairly prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

The psychiatrist also filed a petition for authority to administer involuntary medication. The trial court held commitment and medication hearings. After hearing from the psychiatrist, the trial court ordered the patient to be involuntarily committed to a mental health facility and medicated against her will. The appellate court found that the matter was moot because the involuntary admission was only for a limited time period which had passed. However, it found that the public interest and capable-of-repetition-yet-evading review exceptions to the mootness doctrine applied. It then found that the State conceded that it provided neither social investigation nor possible alternative placement reports required by 405 ILCS 5/3-810 (2006) to the trial court, and that such an error could not be considered harmless or forfeited.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to the collector and district. The appellate court found that the Illinois Pension Code, 40 ILCS 5/7-171(b)(1) (1998), authorized the assessment of such taxes to allow the district to make its contribution to the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund, and nowhere in that statute was there a requirement that the district had to first pass an appropriation for the contribution before the assessment could be levied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged mentally ill person's mother petitioned for his emergency involuntary admission.

The appellate court, after finding the case moot because the hospitalization had ended but reviewable under the public interest exception to mootness, held that the definition of &quot;dangerous conduct&quot; in 405 ILCS 5/1-104.5 (2008) was void for vagueness, as it did not provide a sufficient standard to justify the involuntary hospitalization of a mentally ill individual, particularly in the alleged mentally ill person's case where his conduct and beliefs might seem annoying, but where he reasonably appeared to present little threat of engaging in dangerous conduct. It also found that &quot;dangerous conduct&quot; as referenced in 405 ILCS 5/1-119(3) (2008), which presented the same vagueness problem, violated substantive due process guarantees since it could apply to harm that nevertheless did not justify an involuntary commitment.</SPAN></P>

Prior to filing a lawsuit, the pedestrian  reached a settlement agreement with the other person for the limit of that other person's insurance policy. The trial court then denied the alleged tortfeasors' motion to file a third party action against the other person. Following a trial, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the alleged tortfeasor. The appellate court found that the trial court should not have included the other person, a settling tortfeasor, on the verdict form because that person under 735 ILCS 5/2-1117 (2004) was not a defendant &quot;sued by the plaintiff pursuant to the state supreme court's recent interpretation of that statute in Ready, and because the appellate court could not state for certain that the jury did not consider the other person's role in the accident in reaching its verdict, it found a new trial was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sangamon County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a judgment that found respondent mental illness patient that he was a person subject to involuntary admission and ordering him to be treated for his mental illness for a period not to exceed 90 days at a specified facility pursuant to an agreement for alternative treatment. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient had a long history of mental illness. Petitioner State filed a petition for involuntary admission, at a specific facility, pursuant to the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code, 405 ILCS 5/3-813 (2008). The same day that petition was filed, the State petitioned for alternative treatment, alleging that the patient's condition had recently improved; also provided was an agreement for alternative treatment, which the patient decided not to sign. The trial court then held a hearing on the involuntary admission petition. It found that the State had proved its position by clear and convincing evidence. It then noted that it was allowing the alternative treatment requested in the agreement. The appellate court found that although the case was technically moot since the 90-day involuntary admission period had passed, it involved a matter of public interest and should be reviewed. It also found that the involuntary admission judgment, pursuant to 405 ILCS 5/2-107.1 (2008), and the alternative treatment judgment, under 405 ILCS 5/3-801.5 (2008), could not stand because those proceedings were mutually exclusive and provided for different remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated the trial court's judgment as void for want of statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered final judgments awarding damages after defendant storage facility owners were found liable to plaintiff renter on claims for breach of contract, conversion, and a violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 ILCS 505/10a (2002), due to loss of her personal property from a storage unit. The owners appealed; she cross appealed for a compensatory damage increase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The renter obtained a storage unit from the owners in return for her credit card being automatically billed. However, she was not told that her items were put in a rental unit already rented to another person. The owners sold the personal items stored in her unit when the person to whom the unit was rented fell behind in paying rent, and did not notify the renter, who had always timely paid rent. She sued the owners for breach of contract, conversion, and a violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 ILCS 505/10a (2002) (Act). A jury awarded her identical compensatory damages on the breach of contract and conversion claims. The trial court awarded her damages on claims under the Act. She was also awarded punitive damages on the conversion and Act claims, and attorney fees under the Act. The appellate court found that she could not receive compensatory damages for both breach of contract and conversion, since the claims were based on the same act. It also found the punitive damage award for conversion to be excessive and determined that the compensatory damage award for conversion had to be reexamined, but held the awards made under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment, but ordered that the jury's compensatory damage award be reduced, and directed that the case be remanded to the trial court for a new trial be held on both compensatory and punitive damages regarding the conversion claim.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with domestic battery in violation of 720 ILCS 5/12-3.2(a)(1) (2006) against his girlfriend. At trial, his  ex-wife testified that defendant had physically abused her prior to their marriage. The jury found defendant guilty. Defendant argued on appeal that 725 ILCS 5/115-7.4 (Supp. 2007), which allowed evidence of prior acts of domestic battery to be admissible in a domestic battery trial, was unconstitutional. The appellate court rejected his claim and affirmed upon finding that statutes were presumed to be constitutional and defendant did not meet his burden of showing that 725 ILCS 5/115-7.4 (Supp. 2007) was unconstitutional. It determined that as an alleged domestic abuser, defendant was not a member of a suspect class for equal protection purposes and, thus, the legislation allowing admission of prior bad acts only had to have a rational basis, which it did. It then found that for due process purposes, the statute contained sufficient procedural safeguards because the evidence could not be admitted unless it was both relevant and not unfairly prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee outdoor advertiser sued appellant city in the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief regarding the enforcement of an advertising ordinance against the advertiser. The court barred the city from enforcing the ordinance against the advertiser and ruled that the advertiser was eligible for attorney fees and costs as a prevailing party under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the award of fees and costs was to be reversed because (1) the advertiser was not a prevailing party under the Civil Rights Act of 1991; (2) even if the advertiser was a prevailing party, any victory was de minimis; and (3) section 9-102 of the Illinois Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, 745 ILCS 10/9-102 (2006), did not prescribe attorney fees. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 301 and 303, on the ground that the order finding the advertiser eligible for fees was not appealable because it did not specify the amount of the award. The order denying the motion to reconsider would have been a final order only if the court had set an amount of the award rather than staying the ultimate determination until after the appeal. In addition, the trial court's finding that the order was final and appealable was insufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 304(a). The inclusion of a Rule 304(a) finding in the order did not transform the nonfinal order into a final and appealable order.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) granted the attorney's motion to dismiss the duty of care claim. The wife appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client hired the attorney to either change legal title to, or the beneficial interest in, the property on which the client and the wife lived. The attorney prepared a quitclaim deed that convey title from the client to the client and the wife in joint tenancy and recorded the deed. After the client died, the wife discovered that the property was held in trust and thus, the quitclaim deed conveyed nothing to the wife. On appeal, the wife contended that the dismissal was improper because 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3(d) (1994) excluded the case from the six-year statute of repose. The appellate court agreed. Because the wife did not suffer her injury until after the client died, &sect; 13-214.3(b) of the statute of repose allowed her to file her action against the attorney within two years after the client's death. The appellate court found that the wife did so. Therefore, the trial court erred in holding that the statute of repose barred the duty of care claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with theft in violation of 720 ILCS 5/16-1(a)(5) (2006) for obtaining or exerting control over property in the custody of any law enforcement agency after defendant purchased several cell phones from undercover police. Defendant bought the phones over several months for  sums far less than their indicated retail price. Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted. On appeal, he asserted that the evidence was insufficient to establish he had the crime's requisite knowledge and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. The appellate court found that even though testimony did not show that the term &quot;stolen&quot; was ever used during the transactions, the statute's requirement that an &quot;explicit representation&quot; be made that the property was stolen because unambiguous veiled references to stealing, such as police telling defendant that they nearly got caught taking the phones from a store, were made. It also found that defendant did not show he received ineffective assistance of counsel since most of what defendant objected to was defense counsel's choice of trial tactics, and defendant did not show that he had been prejudiced by counsel's conduct.</SPAN></P>

(2006). The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a random audit of the employer's taxable wages and contributions for a particular tax year, defendant employment security agency determined that the employer's liability for unemployment insurance contributions exceeded its payments remitted. The agency demanded payment. The employer sought a hearing to determine if its contracted physicians, scheduler, and auditor were employees under the Illinois Unemployment Insurance Act, 820 ILCS 405/100 et seq. (2006) (Act). A hearing was held. The director eventually determined that the employer had to pay the requested contributions. The trial court affirmed. The appellate court found that the workers at issue were employees, rather than independent contractors, as pursuant to 820 ILCS 405/212(B) (2006), the services they provided were within the employer's usual course of business and were not services incidental to it. The appellate court also found that the fact that the director administered Act was not a violation of the employer's due process rights since the director did not have expansive executive powers or receive a direct gain from decisions under the administrative process provided by the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">These consolidated appeals arose out of a filing by a utility company of an action with the Illinois Commerce Commission in which the company sought to restructure and alter the rates it charged certain customers, including a building manager association and two railroads.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the benefits of the incentive plan to ratepayers in the sense that attracting good employees raised the level of service customers would receive was too remote to be included in the rate base under 220 ILCS 5/16-108(c). The company did not show a sufficient nexus between the earnings-per-share portion of the incentive compensation plan and a benefit to ratepayers. Discontinuance of the members of the association's rider that gave them a preferential rate for electricity used for space-heating purposes was not a termination of service under 220 ILCS 5/16-103(a), and was within the Commission's authority. The allowance for the recovery of the company's construction costs for new supply facilities and of the charges for reserving capacity within its distribution system did not violate the Contract Clauses, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10 and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. A rider that allowed the company to recover costs associated with reserving capacity for the railroads' automatic load transfer systems did not violate the Illinois Public Utilities Act, 220 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq. (2004). 220 ILCS 5/16-129 did not limit the Commission's authority over utility rates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of unlawful use of a weapon for possession of a sawed-off shotgun in violation of 720 ILCS 5/24-1(a)(7)(ii) (2006)). He then received a probationary sentence. He claimed on appeal that: (1) the State failed to prove him guilty of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt because the weapon recovered was in such disrepair that it was not a deadly weapon; and (2) the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him because it punished his innocent conduct. The appellate court found that unlike some other statutes regarding weapons, 720 ILCS 5/24-1(a)(7)(ii) (2006) did not contain an exception for broken down weapons in a non-functioning state, and, thus, it was within the trial court's province to determine whether the weapon was a deadly weapon under the statute. It also found that the statute was designed to protect the public from the inherent dangers of sawed-off shot guns and imposing a culpable mental state would defeat that purpose. As a result, it found that the statute, as applied to defendant, did not violate his due process rights because it was reasonably related to the goal of public safety and did not sweep too broadly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court, County Department Law Division (Illinois), where defendant state revenue department sought to tax plaintiff corporation's airplane based on its purchase price, granted summary judgment for the Department regarding the validity of the tax. However, it granted summary judgment to the corporation upon finding that only a limited &quot;actual use&quot; tax could be imposed. Both the Department and the corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the corporation purchased the aircraft partially for use in Illinois, the Department audited the purchase and determined that a use tax pursuant to the Use Tax Act, 35 ILCS 105/1 et seq. (Act), was due. As a result, it issued a notice of tax liability to the corporation that assessed use tax, penalties, and accrued interest. The corporation paid the amount allegedly owed and sued the Department. One of the corporation's claims was that the use tax was not validly imposed because the use did not have a &quot;substantial nexus&quot; with Illinois. It also asserted that even if the use tax was valid, the tax should not be on the airplane's purchase price, but according to the more limited &quot;actual use&quot; of the airplane in Illinois. The trial court granted summary judgment for the Department on the validity question, but granted summary judgment to the corporation on the claim for a limited tax. The appellate court found that the evidence showed that the use of the airplane had a &quot;substantial nexus&quot; with Illinois. However, it also found that an &quot;actual use&quot; limitation was not required because the Act allowed for apportionment via a credit provision in case a use tax was imposed elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment to the extent that the trial court found that the use tax was validly imposed. It reversed the trial court's judgment to the extent that the trial court found that the use tax had to be limited to the actual usage of the airplane because a use tax did not have to be apportioned so long as a credit provision was in place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party sued a vehicle driver and his mother, the vehicle owner, for injuries she sustained when she was struck by a vehicle being operated by the vehicle driver.

The trial court granted summary judgment to the vehicle owner and vehicle driver on res judicata grounds. It also sanctioned the injured party's counsel for not appearing at the hearing regarding the vehicle driver's motion. Furthermore, it denied the injured party's 735 ILCS 5/2-1001(a)(2) (2006) motion for substitution of judge. The appellate court found that denial of the motion for substitution was proper since there had already been a ruling on a substantial issue and that the injured party did not support her argument with citation to relevant authority about her counsel being sanctioned. However, it found that the 735 ILCS 5/2-1009(a) (2004) voluntary dismissal as to the vehicle owner was not a final and appealable ruling as to the vehicle driver, which meant he should not have been granted summary judgment on res judicata grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a 23-count second amended complaint alleging, inter alia, abuse of process, malicious prosecution, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, arising from a lawsuit defendants previously filed against plaintiff in federal court. The instant appeal was from an order denying two motions to dismiss. The appellate court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction over the appeal. The denial of a motion to dismiss, of itself, was not a final and appealable order within the purview of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 307, as it was a mere interlocutory order, which did not give the appellate court jurisdiction on appeal. Also, 735 ILCS 110/20 (a) (Supp. 2007) would not confer jurisdiction on the appellate court in the absence of a final judgment, and to the extent the Citizen Participation Act attempted to provide for appeals from less than final judgments, it would be unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6, granted the right to appeal from a final judgment only. A statute that claimed to give a right to an interlocutory appeal not covered by supreme court rules or to give the appellate court jurisdiction over that appeal would violate Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, convicting him of false personation of an attorney under 720 ILCS 5/32-5 (2002) for rendering a trademark opinion while he knowingly lacked the authority to practice law, and sentencing him to one year of probation and 100 hours of community service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2003, the client retained defendant's services as a patent attorney to provide a legal opinion on a trademark matter. Defendant, a law school graduate since 1974, replied to the letter with a three-page legal opinion on the trademark issue, listing himself in the opinion's letterhead as an attorney at law and patent attorney. Defendant collected $ 11,005.70 for this work. Defendant had been admitted to the patent bar until 1990, when his name was removed from the roster of registered patent attorneys and patent agents. The appellate court ruled that the State provided sufficient evidence to convict defendant of false personation of an attorney. A mere assertion by defendant that he was admitted to the bar in Texas or anywhere else was insufficient to require the State to prove he was not admitted in that jurisdiction. The State presented sufficient evidence to prove that defendant knowingly practiced law without authorization from the Michigan bar. Also, the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant knowingly practiced law without authority from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 22 right to bear arms or the Second Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

The appellate court found that the Heller ruling did not incorporate the Second Amendment so as to make it applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. It also found that under Ill. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 12th Judicial Circuit Court, Will County (Illinois), entered a final judgment of conviction after defendant pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of prostitution in violation of 720 ILCS 5/11-14(a) (2002).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police conducted an undercover investigation into defendant's massage therapy business. An officer posed as a potential client, entered her house, and requested services. After defendant informed the officer that she would massage his genital area and anus for a specified sum, the officer and other officers arrested her. She was then charged with misdemeanor prostitution in violation of 720 ILCS 5/11-14 (2002). She voluntarily pled guilty. On appeal, the appellate court found that she could not challenge the denial of her motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence since her decision to voluntarily plead guilty waived any defenses raised in the motion. It also found that the prostitution statue was neither unconstitutionally overbroad, because her exercise of protected First Amendment rights was not inhibited, nor vague because the statute unambiguously prohibited defendant's conduct in providing notice that the offer of money in exchange for sex was proscribed. Too, it found that her equal protection rights were not violated since she was not similarly situated to clients under the statute and that she did not show she had an adequate ground for withdrawing her guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court (CC) of St. Clair County (Illinois) denied a motion by defendant interstate compact entity to dismiss a complaint filed against it by plaintiff driver, arising from a vehicle collision with a public bus. The CC certified a question regarding whether, inter alia, the entity was a &quot;local public entity&quot; as defined by the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, 745 ILCS 10/8-101 et seq. (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The entity was responsible for operating mass transportation on both sides of the Mississippi River. The driver's vehicle was hit by a bus, and he filed suit, alleging that the bus driver's negligence caused the collision, and that the entity was vicariously liable. The entity sought dismissal based on 735 ILCS 5/2-619(5) (2006), and the CC denied it. It certified a question as to whether the agency was a local public entity under 745 ILCS 10/1-206 (2006), such that it was subject to the one-year statute of limitations of 745 ILCS 10/8-101(a) (2006). The court reviewed the nature of interstate compact entities, noting that authority for such an entity had to come from both states and be approved by Congress. It concluded that the legislature did not intend to include the entity within the Act's definition of a &quot;local public entity.&quot; Accordingly, the one-year limitations period under &sect; 8-101(a) did not apply to the driver's claim. The court noted that while it could not overrule the precedential decision of Grady, 151 Ill. App. 3d 749, it declined to follow it. The Transportation Cooperation Act, 5 ILCS 225/2 (2006), did not support inclusion of the entity within the definition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of shooting at a van full of people and killing one of them. The appellate court noted that codefendant, who was the driver of the vehicle defendant was riding in when he shot at the van, was offered the benefits of a plea agreement in exchange for his &quot;truthful&quot; testimony, not in exchange for his &quot;consistent&quot; testimony.&quot; In addition, codefendant was required to plead guilty to conspiracy and swear to the facts contained in the plea agreement. Thus, the admission of codefendant's testimony pursuant to a plea agreement did not deny defendant due process. There was no evidence that defendant fired at the van to kill the victim. Rather, he simply opened fire on the van and, as a result, the victim was shot. Defendant's felonious conduct had a purpose other than the killing of the victim. Thus, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on felony murder. While defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to be present when the trial judge responded to the jury's note in his absence, he failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the error. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentences.</SPAN></P>

A different judge heard and denied the motion. The judge then awarded maintenance, and, in doing so, took into account that the former wife was the primary caretaker for the children, which allowed the former husband to earn a substantial salary. The judge also directed the former wife to obtain employment commensurate with her training and education. The appellate court found that the former husband did not establish that the judge was actually prejudiced against him and the award of maintenance was not an abuse of discretion given the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, a mentally impaired man, appealed the order of the Circuit Court of Randolph County (Illinois), which found him subject to involuntary admission, pursuant to the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code, 405 ILCS 5/1-100 et seq. (2006). Petitioner filed a petition for involuntary admission, alleging that respondent continued to be a person subject to involuntary admission pursuant, 405 ILCS 5/3-813(b) (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent had been residing at a mental health center after he was acquitted from attempting to escape from a group home. Petitioner asserted that respondent was a danger to himself and others and was unable to provide for his basic physical needs or protect himself from harm without help. Petitioner alleged that respondent was aggressive and often refused medication. Respondent had a long history of mental illness and he was placed in the custody of the State as an infant due to inadequate parental supervision. Of significance in the case was that respondent waived his right to a hearing on the petition to find him subject to involuntary admission. The court found error, concluding that the trial court's inquiry into respondent's capacity to make the waiver was woefully inadequate. The court further held that respondent, nor any other person subject to possible involuntary commitment, may not effectively waive the entire hearing on a petition for involuntary admission.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was also charged with official misconduct, 720 ILCS 5/33-3(b) (1998). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted defendant a directed verdict on the criminal drug conspiracy count, but found defendant guilty of official misconduct and sentenced defendant to probation and community service.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Illinois accused defendant, a police department dispatcher, of notifying a codefendant about police activity near the codefendant's residence to facilitate illegal drug-dealing by the codefendant. Defendant contended that, assuming she disseminated confidential information, the State failed to prove that her acts violated a law as required by the official misconduct statute. The State maintained that it proved defendant guilty of official misconduct because she violated the rules and regulations of the police department by disseminating confidential information to the codefendant. On appeal, the court found that defendant was a public employee because (1) she was authorized to perform official functions (dispatched information for the police department); and (2) she was paid by a municipality of the State under 720 ILCS 5/2-17 (1998). However, the official misconduct statute required the State to prove that defendant violated a law. Instead, the State presented evidence that defendant violated the police department's rules and regulations, which were not laws. Therefore, defendant did not violate the official misconduct statute because defendant did not violate a law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of criminal drug conspiracy under 720 ILCS 570/405.1 (2004) and delivery of more than 100 but less than 400 grams of cocaine, possession of more than 900 grams of cocaine with intent to deliver, and possession of 1 to 15 grams of cocaine with intent to deliver under 720 ILCS 570/401(a)(2)(D) (2004).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested following an undercover investigation into a suspected drug ring. Throughout the trial, the State of Illinois played tape-recorded conversations between an undercover police investigator and a drug dealer as well as surveillance videotapes of their interactions. The State also played tape-recorded conversations that were intercepted pursuant to electronic surveillance orders. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in issuing wiretap orders under 725 ILCS 5/108B-4(a)(3)(viii) (1998), or extensions of the wiretaps, because the affidavits appended in support of the application sufficiently demonstrated that other normal investigative procedures had been tried and had failed, appeared to be unlikely to succeed if tried, or were too dangerous to employ. Furthermore, the evidence was sufficient to support the criminal drug conspiracy conviction. Moreover, the stop and search of a vehicle without a warrant was not unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. However, defendant could not have been convicted of both criminal drug conspiracy and intent to deliver cocaine under 720 ILCS 5/8-5 (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence for criminal drug conspiracy were vacated, but the remaining convictions and sentences for possession with intent to deliver were affirmed.

The Circuit Court of DeWitt County (Illinois) sentenced him to 20 years in prison. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant filed for leave to appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because 725 ILCS 5/115-10(b) (2002) created a hearsay exception that was not firmly rooted in the common law, the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI, required that the victim's statements to her mother and a child advocacy worker possess particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. The appellate court concluded that the Confrontation Clause was not an issue under the circumstances of the instant action, because the victim &quot;appeared&quot; for cross-examination and answered defense counsel's questions. Defendant also argued that the admission of the subject statements was error because the statements were unreliable. While defendant forfeited the issue, the appellate court nonetheless rejected it on the merits, concluding that the victim's delay in reporting the incident did not render the statements inadmissible and the statements did not seemed coached. Finally, defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial based in improper comments made by the prosecutor. Even if the comments were improper, the error did not result in substantial prejudice to defendant, as the jury was instructed that closing arguments were not evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Adams County (Illinois), which convicted her of unlawful possession of pseudoephedrine in violation of &sect; 20(b) of Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act, 720 ILCS 648/20(b) (2006). She argued that &sect; 20(b) violated the due-process guarantee of Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant knowingly purchased products containing more than 7,500 milligrams of pseudoephedrine within a 30-day period in violation of the Act. The appellate court held that the restrictions in &sect; 20(b) represented a valid exercise of police power and did not violate the due-process clause of the Illinois Constitution. Section 20(b) bore a reasonable relationship to the State's interest in stopping the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine. The legislature found that ephedrine or pseudoephedrine was the &quot;essential ingredient,&quot; 720 ILCS 648/5 (2006), in methamphetamine. It could reasonably have determined that a link existed between individuals making repeated purchases of small quantities of products containing methamphetamine precursors over short periods of time and the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine. Section 20(b) provided a reasonable means of limiting the amount of methamphetamine precursor available for diversion to the manufacture of methamphetamine. That diversion affected the public welfare. As a result, the legislature had the ability to use its police power to place limits on the purchase of products containing methamphetamine precursors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of predatory sexual assault of a child and aggravated sexual abuse and was sentenced to nine consecutive life terms of imprisonment for the predatory sexual assault and a concurrent 14-year term for aggravated sexual abuse. The convictions were affirmed, and the life sentences were made concurrent. Defendant's petition for leave to appeal with the Illinois Supreme Court was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court was directed to reconsider its decision in light of In re Rolandis G. The appellate court held that 725 ILCS 5/115-10 (2004) was not facially unconstitutional as a violation of the Confrontation Clause, U.S. Const., amend. VI and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The admission of an 11-year-old victim's hearsay statements under &sect; 115-10 did not violate the Confrontation Clause. The victim testified consistently with her hearsay statements that defendant forced his penis into her mouth, between her legs, and into her vagina. On cross-examination, the victim answered all of the questions put to her by defense counsel. The victim appeared for cross-examination under Crawford and the Confrontation Clause. As the victim was present for cross-examination and answered defense counsel's questions, the Confrontation Clause did not constrain the use of the victim's prior statements. Life terms could not be served consecutively. Defendant forfeited his appeal as to the use of the age of the victim as an aggravating factor for aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Rolandis G. did not warrant a different result as it did not address when a declarant appeared for cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's earlier decision was vacated.

The State was granted its statutory assessment of $ 50 against defendant as costs of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On direct appeal, the inmate raised two claim of ineffective assistance by trial counsel, which the court found would be more appropriately decided in a postconviction proceeding. The inmate failed to raise those issues in his postconviction petition. On appeal, the inmate contended that the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the constitution required that he have legal counsel appointed to assist him in preparing his postconviction petition. The appellate court concluded that the inmate waived his ineffective assistance claims and that it did not have the authority to excuse that waiver. The appellate court further concluded that the inmate did not have a constitutional right to the assistance of counsel in preparing his postconviction petition. The appellate court disagreed with the inmate's claim that the appellate court effectively created a discretionary review process, requiring him to make a preliminary showing of merit before he could secure his first direct review of the ineffective assistance claims when it declined to consider them on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the Department's and the group home operator's motion to dismiss. The legal guardian appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legal guardian averred that her autistic and mentally retarded adult son lived in a group home, and, because of his disabilities, he engaged in self-injurious behavior.

She therefore sought to require the group home operator to use CES therapy to treat her son. On appeal, the court found that (1) &sect; 2-110 of the Illinois Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code, 405 ILCS 5/2-110 (2006), was unconstitutional as it violated the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

XIV or 405 ILCS 5/2-102(a) (2006) to adequate and humane care and services in the least restrictive environment was violated; (4) a settlement agreement did not require the continued use of CES; and (5) the separation of powers doctrine was not violated by the enactment of 20 ILCS 1705/15f.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of two counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child and sentenced him to consecutive nine-year prison terms on each count. On direct appeal, defendant's convictions were affirmed. The Supreme Court of Illinois denied defendant's petition for leave to appeal but also entered a nonprecedential supervisory order and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court first found that defendant forfeited his objection to the admission of the victim's testimony via closed-circuit television on the ground that the requirements of 725 ILCS 5/106B-5(a)(2) (2004) were not met, by failing to object on that ground. The appellate court also rejected defendant's challenge to the admission of the victims' statements under 725 ILCS 5/115-10 (2004), finding the statute constitutional and the Confrontation Clause not an issue. Among other things, the appellate court found that the victim &quot;appeared&quot; for cross-examination, in that she was present for cross-examination and answered defense counsel's questions. While the trial court erred in failing to give the jury an instruction regarding the statements admitted under &sect; 115-10 with all of the other instructions, reversal was not required as the jury was provided such an instruction after the testimony of each of the three witnesses who testified about the victim's statements. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the decision in In re Rolandis G. did not warrant a different result, as that decision did not address the issue of whether the declarant &quot;appeared&quot; for cross-examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated its earlier decision and then again affirmed defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that (1) defendant stipulated to an adequate chain of custody of the cocaine; (2) his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding the stipulation was better suited to postconviction proceedings; (3) any waiver of defendant's presence while notes from the deliberating jury were discussed was harmless; (4) he could not be convicted of an inchoate offense, conspiracy, and the principal offense, unlawful delivery, but only of unlawful delivery; (5) he could not be found guilty of a greater offense, unlawful delivery, and a lesser offense, unlawful possession with intent to deliver, but only of unlawful delivery; and (6) he could be fined under separate statutes, one mandatory and one discretionary, but was entitled to a presentence credit and a credit on a mandatory drug treatment assessment.</SPAN></P>

It also remanded the case to the trial court to amend the sentencing order as directed and otherwise affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol (aggravated DUI) under 625 ILCS 5/11-501(d)(1)(F) (2006). Following a sentencing hearing, the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to three years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statutory sentencing provision requiring a trial court to find &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; existed before it could impose a sentence of probation was unconstitutionally vague on its face and because it was subject to arbitrary and discriminatory application. The appellate court disagreed, concluding that the uncertainty of when probation could be imposed did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague on its face. The fact that the legislature did not specifically delineate the exact circumstances that constitute an &quot;extraordinary circumstance,&quot; but rather left such a determination to a trial court's sound discretion, did not render 625 ILCS 5/11-501(d)(2) (2006) of the Illinois Vehicle Code unconstitutionally vague. Defendant also argued that even assuming the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, the trial court nonetheless abused its discretion by failing to find extraordinary circumstances existed. Essentially, defendant argued that because he did not receive probation, the sentence imposed by the trial court was excessive. The appellate court disagreed, finding no abuse of discretion and that the sentence imposed was entirely reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The State was awarded a $ 50 statutory assessment against defendant as costs of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Acting Director of the Illinois Department of Central Management Services appealed an order entered by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied its motion to dismiss plaintiff tenant's declaratory judgment count seeking an interpretation of 20 ILCS 405/405-315(a) (2006), and granting the tenant's motion for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the prayer for relief did not transform the claim from a statutory interpretation claim into a contract dispute. The tenant's claim was a claim for prospective relief and was not barred by sovereign immunity. Because the interpretation of the statute was never litigated in a prior case, it was not barred by collateral estoppel. There was an actual controversy between the parties. A ruling as to the interpretation of the statute would resolve any uncertainty regarding the duration of the tenant's leasehold, the future marketability of the leasehold, and any mortgage financing issues. The tenant's complaint sought a declaration of the parties' rights pursuant to the enabling statute, which was a law, not a recommendation. The claim was ripe. Finally, the trial court properly interpreted the statute. The Director could exercise her discretion to enter into the lease only at its inception, not at every renewal period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from the police obtaining a search warrant following a statement from a jail informant that defendant had an illegal firearm hidden under a couch at a certain residence, which was discovered. On appeal, defendant asserted that his conviction for the offense of armed habitual criminal was violative of the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The court disagreed and held that the armed habitual criminal statute was not violative of the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws as the statute did not punish defendant for the offenses he committed before the statute creating the offense was enacted. Rather, defendant was convicted for the separate offense of possessing a firearm after having been convicted of three of the statute's enumerated offenses. Thus, his prior convictions were only an element of the offense and he was not punished for acts that occurred prior to the statute's effective date but for the new act of possessing a firearm. The court found no abuse of the trial court's discretion in allowing the State to declare the jail informant a hostile witness since he could not remember his prior statement and was uncooperative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court erred by dismissing appellant's petition under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 ILCS 5/122-1, because four of his sentences for home invasion exceeded the statutory maximum and were void. Appellant also asserted a claim of constitutional deprivation based on a double jeopardy violation caused by a second home invasion conviction for a single break-in. Appellant did not forfeit his claim regarding the violation of the one-act one-crime principle by failing to raise it in a direct appeal. The summary remand for noncompliance with the attorney certification requirement of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d) had the same effect as the filing of no appeal at all. Accordingly, the petition was neither frivolous nor patently without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee former patient sued appellants, a nursing home and others, alleging violations of the Nursing Home Care Act (210 ILCS 45/1-101 et seq. (2006)) and for negligence. Appellants challenged a ruling by the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) that denied their motion to enforce an arbitration clause that required that disputes be resolved through arbitration, as governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) (9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties agreed that &sect; 2 of the FAA and 210 ILCS 45/3-606 and 3-607 of the Nursing Home Care Act were unambiguous and that, absent preemption, the Nursing Home Care Act governed the admission agreement and the resident's stay at the home. The court followed the holding in Perry and rejected Carter, finding that there were only two limitations on the enforceability of arbitration provisions governed by the FAA: (1) they had to be part of a written maritime contract or (2) a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce, and such clauses were revocable on grounds as existed at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. There was nothing in the FAA to indicate that the broad principle of enforceability of arbitration clauses was subject to any additional limitations under state law; 710 ILCS 5/2(a) (2002) favored arbitration as a means of resolving disputes. The court found that the resident forfeited the issue of whether the nursing home admission agreement was a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce and held that the judicial forum provisions of &sect;&sect; 3-606 and 3-607 were not grounds as existed at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order denying appellants' motion to dismiss and remanded the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a judgment that granted the motion of plaintiff bail bond interest claimants for class certification and denied the motion to dismiss filed by defendants, a circuit clerk and a county, after the claimants sought payment of interest on returned bail bond funds. The appellate court granted the petition for leave to appeal the circuit clerk and county filed regarding the grant of class certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants sought to recover the interest that accrued on money that they deposited with circuit clerk, in connection with bail bonds that they executed. In addition to suing the circuit clerk, they also sued the county. The trial court granted the claimants' motion for class certification and denied the circuit clerk and county's motion to dismiss asserting that the claimants had not stated a cause of action. The appellate court granted the circuit clerk and county's petition for leave to appeal the grant of class certification. The appellate court then found that the claimants could not meet the threshold requirement of showing that they stated a cause of action, making moot a ruling on whether class certification was properly granted. The appellate court found that the statute regarding the return of bail bond funds, 725 ILCS 5/110-7(f) (2006), did not say anything about paying interest. Too, though the claimants asserted that the statute was facially unconstitutional for taking property without just compensation, no taking occurred because the amounts at issued were paid to secure the release of a person and, thus, no automatic right to return of the funds existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgments granting class certification, and denying the motion to dismiss filed by the circuit clerk and county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into a fully negotiated plea of guilty to four counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. He agreed to consecutive sentences of six years in prison on each charge, the sum total of which had to be served at 85 percent pursuant to a truth-in-sentencing law. He also received a sentence credit. He did not file a direct appeal. More than 11 years after he was sentenced, he filed a 735 ILCS 5/122-1 et seq. (2006) pro se postconviction relief petition. The trial court determined that the petition was not timely filed and that he had received the benefit of his plea. The appellate court found that the trial court erred in finding the petition to be untimely filed because the State had not raised that issue. However, it also found that he was not entitled to shorten his sentence by the mandatory supervised release (MSR) time that attached to it, but about which he had not been informed. The appellate court found that a reduction of his sentence due to the fact that the truth-in-sentencing law had been found unconstitutional meant that his ultimate sentence, even with the MSR, was considerably less than amount of time he agreed to under the plea bargain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with unlawful possession of a controlled substance. The Circuit Court of Clark County (Illinois) granted defendant's motion to suppress, finding that a deputy did not have a reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's car to investigate a material obstruction of the driver's view out of her front windshield in violation of &sect; 12-503(c) (625 ILCS 5/12-503(c) (2004)) of the Illinois Vehicle Code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed. The appellate court held that the air freshener was significantly smaller than the deputy estimated on the witness stand. The air freshener was less than three inches wide at its widest point and only three inches tall. The deputy only articulated facts showing defendant had an air freshener suspended from her rearview mirror. The deputy's decision to pull defendant over was based upon a mistake of law. Defendant made a prima facie showing the search was unlawful, and the burden shifted to the State. Given the lack of specificity in the deputy's response and his overestimation of the air freshener's size, the trial court did not improperly find the deputy's testimony lacked credibility. Although made in good faith, the stop was pretextual for Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV purposes. The deputy never testified how he believed the air freshener might have materially obstructed defendant's view. Size alone did not determine whether an object materially obstructed the driver's view. The appellate court recommended that the Illinois legislature consider whether the approach used to regulate obstruction of drivers' views.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of its judgment, the builder obtained a refund of the impact fees it paid to the village for 19 homes in built there between 1993 and 1997, namely an award of $ 114,700. The trial court found that the village exceeded its authority in enacting the ordinances imposing the impact fees and, therefore, determined that the ordinances were unenforceable. The court agreed, finding that as to the school impact fees charged, the trial court properly found that those fees were void under the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/11-12-5(1)(b) (2000), which prohibited a cash donation for general operations, as opposed to school grounds, as the fees directed to be forwarded to a school's general operation fund. As to the open space impact fees, the court held that the trial court properly found that the fees were solely revenue oriented and that there was no evidence that the village ordinances considered anything individual to the developer's activity. As to the developer's cross-appeal, the court found that the village's actions were not fraudulent, therefore, there was no entitlement to collecting prejudgment interest against it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court of Fayette County (Illinois) that dismissed his 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 petition for relief from judgment; defendant claimed that the trial court erred in failing to recharacterize his petition as a pleading filed under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 ILCS 5/122-1 et seq. (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's appellate counsel, on three separate occasions, informed the court that defendant's petition was a postconviction petition, and each time the State failed to object to the characterization. In addition, defense counsel specifically asked the trial court to recharacterize the petition as a postconviction petition. The appellate court found, inter alia, that by appointing counsel to represent defendant and ordering counsel to file a Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c) certificate, the trial court was treating defendant's pleading as a postconviction petition. While defendant's claims were subject to dismissal under &sect; 2-1401, they were appropriately considered in a postconviction petition. Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to recharacterize defendant's petition under &sect; 5/122-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the cause was remanded with directions to recharacterize defendant's petition as a postconviction petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a beneficiary under a will, appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found that his legal malpractice action against defendants, an attorney and her law firm, were time barred and dismissed the action on that basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beneficiary's action was based on the failure of a bequest to him due to defendants negligence in drafting the decedent's will. Defendants argued that the action was time barred pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3(d) (1994). Under the statute, the beneficiary's action had to be filed within the time for filing a petition contesting the validity of the will or the time for filing claims against the estate, whichever was later. The deadline for contesting the validity of the will had passed by the time the malpractice action was filed. However, the action was filed before the time for filing claims against the estate had elapsed. Contrary to defendants assertion, 755 ILCS 5/18-3(a) (2006) allowed for more than one deadline for filing such claims. Separate deadlines could exist for claims by unknown creditors and known creditors. In the instant case, while the time in which unknown creditors could file claims had elapsed, the time for known creditors to file claims had not elapsed on the date the malpractice action was filed. Thus, the malpractice action was timely under &sect; 13-214.3(d).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an attorney and his firm, challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that denied their motion to dismiss a complaint filed by appellees, residents of Florida and Missouri, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The complaint alleged fraud, a violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (815 ILCS 505/1 et seq. (2002)), conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, and conversion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney claimed that he and his firm had insufficient contacts with Illinois to be subject to long-arm jurisdiction under 735 ILCS 5/2-209(a) (2006). The sole issue was whether it was error to conclude that Illinois courts could exercise jurisdiction over appellants, who were Texas residents. Appellees conceded that appellants had not had continuous and systematic contact with Illinois so as to subject them to general personal jurisdiction, nor were appellants subject to specific personal jurisdiction. Appellees did not show that appellants purposefully directed their conduct towards Illinois so as to have an effect there. The purpose of the alleged conspiracy was to secure the money of the residents of Florida and Missouri through fraud. Any injury suffered by appellees was suffered in their home states, not in Illinois. Appellants' actions in furtherance of the conspiracy, including the attorney's transfer of funds allegedly stolen from appellees to an entity in Illinois, were not purposely directed towards Illinois. Appellants' activities did not meet the Rudzewicz test so as to subject them to in personam jurisdiction, even if the conspiracy theory of jurisdiction applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order.</SPAN></P>
