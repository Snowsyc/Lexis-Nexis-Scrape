<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of two counts of first degree murder following a jury trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court made a sua sponte Batson challenge to defense counsel's peremptory strike of an African-American juror. The supreme court saw no clear indication of a prima facie case of racial discrimination. The only factor that appeared to weigh in favor of a prima facie case was the fact that defendant was Hispanic and both the victim and the potential juror were African-American. No other considerations supported the trial court's apparent belief that a prima facie case existed. The record did not reveal a prima facie case of racial discrimination, if indeed that, as opposed to race-gender discrimination, was the basis for the sua sponte action. A trial court could raise a Batson issue sua sponte, but it could do so only when a prima facie case of discrimination was abundantly clear. Moreover, the trial court had to make an adequate record consisting of all relevant facts, factual findings, and articulated bases for both its finding of a prima facie case and for its ultimate determination at the third stage of the Batson procedure. The record was insufficient to demonstrate either a prima facie case of racial discrimination or the bases for the trial court's rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was remanded to the circuit court for a hearing on the existence of a prima facie case of discrimination. At that hearing, any omitted evidence pertinent to that question could be included in the record. The circuit court was to articulate proper findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the threshold question of a prima facie case of discrimination and specify what kind of discrimination it believed was at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of two counts of first degree murder and was subsequently sentenced to 85 years' incarceration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was the trial court's sua sponte Batson challenge to defense counsel's peremptory strike of a female African-American juror. The supreme court found that the record in its current state did not reveal a prima facie case of racial discrimination, if indeed that-as opposed to race-gender discrimination-was the basis for the trial court's sua sponte action. The supreme court held that a trial court could raise a Batson issue sua sponte, but it could do so only when a prima facie case of discrimination was abundantly clear. Moreover, the trial court had to make an adequate record consisting of all relevant facts, factual findings, and articulated bases for both its finding of a prima facie case and for its ultimate determination of discrimination at the third stage of the Batson procedure. The record in the instant case was insufficient to demonstrate either a prima facie case of racial discrimination or the bases for the trial court's rulings. There could be evidence that was not made a part of the record because the trial court believed that the preliminary matter of a prima facie case would become moot after it ruled on the third-stage issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was remanded to the circuit court for a limited hearing to allow the trial judge an opportunity to articulate the bases for his Batson rulings, particularly in regard to the threshold question of a prima facie case of discrimination. After proceedings on remand were completed, and any supplemental arguments were considered, the court would announce its judgment on any and all pending issues requiring resolution at that time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. The trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(a) (codified as amended at 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(b) (2004)). The Illinois appellate court modified his sentence to 60 years. The State appealed. Defendant requested cross-relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court enhanced the sentence based on its finding that the crime was accompanied by exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty. The court first held that because the finding had not been made by a jury, the sentence violated Apprendi. Applying a plain-error analysis because defendant had not timely objected to the error, the court held that defendant had not proven that the evidence was closely balanced as to whether his crime was exceptionally brutal or heinous and indicative of wanton cruelty. Defendant's cutting off the victim's head after his death indicated brutality in regard to his family, and testimony that defendant struck the victim repeatedly with a baseball bat displayed wanton cruelty. Thus, defendant's procedural default of the Apprendi violation could not be excused. Next, the trial court properly held inadmissible a juror's affidavit in which the juror stated that jurors inappropriately considered defendant's previous trial and his failure to testify. The allegations concerned only the jury's private deliberations and were not of the sort subject to extraneous proof; thus, the affidavit was inadmissible to impeach the verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment. It reversed the appellate court's modification of defendant's sentence. It affirmed the decisions of the trial court and the appellate court as they pertained to defendant's request for cross-relief.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-2c (1998). It also found that statute constituted impermissible special legislation. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-2c (1998), the property owner petitioned the state education superintendent to detach his parcel of vacant farmland property from the existing school districts associated with a township and annex it to adjoining school districts associated with the village. The trial court, however, found that the petition did not comply with 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-2c (1998) and additionally found that 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-2c (1998) constituted special legislation in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13. On appeal, the state supreme court found that the property owner's petition to detach vacant farmland property from the township school districts and annex it to the adjoining village school districts did not violate the statute, as the language of the statute dictated that the village to which the property was annexed only had to be in either the elementary or high school district and did not require that village be within both districts. The state supreme court also found that there was no special legislation violation because the law did not exclude any entity from a benefit received by the property owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the state education superintendent's order was confirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of, among other crimes, three counts of first degree murder (720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(a) (2002)) for killing three persons. The Circuit Court of Stark County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to death on each of the first degree murder convictions. Pursuant to Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4(b) (1970), defendant's appeal was brought directly to the supreme court because he was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the sentence was inappropriate because he acted under an extreme mental disturbance at the time of the murders and had no significant prior criminal history. The supreme court disagreed. A psychiatrist testified that defendant did not suffer from any delusional disorder pursuant to the 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(c)(2) mitigating factor. Rather, defendant suffered from two behavioral disorders, paranoid personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. His conduct was the culmination of an escalating pattern of violence against citizens in the community, and not the result of a spontaneous reaction. The trial court specifically found that defendant remained a threat to society, and that if given the opportunity, he would continue to be violent. Even if he had established the mitigating circumstance of an extreme mental disturbance, it would not be sufficient to overcome the aggravating circumstances. The Apprendi and Ring rules were not applicable to the second phase of a death penalty proceeding in Illinois because the trier of fact had already found beyond a reasonable doubt the necessary aggravating factor for imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the denial by Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) of his motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence on charges of burglary and theft. He also challenged the constitutionality of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2002). The latter argument challenged the statute both on its face and as applied in the case under the search and seizure provisions of the federal constitution and the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued a lack of probable cause for his arrest because the police had no particularized suspicion that he was involved in the theft of a license plate based on his proximity to a stolen van to which the plate had been attached. He also alleged that the taking of blood for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis and registration under &sect;&nbsp;5-4-3 was unconstitutional. The appellate court found a lack of probable cause for defendant's arrest and harmless error in the admission of certain statements. Finding that the evidence presented a sufficient basis for the finding of probable cause, the supreme court affirmed the denial of both the motion to quash and the motion to suppress. The supreme court also held that &sect; 5-4-3 was constitutional as applied to defendant. Thus, it was also facially constitutional. The purpose of the statute was to create a DNA database that could aid in future investigations to absolve innocents and identify the guilty. It was constitutional under both the special needs and the balancing only tests. Further, as a convicted felon, defendant's privacy rights were greatly reduced, and the drawing of blood was considered a minimal intrusion on those rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court affirmed the appellate court's ultimate judgment. It also found the DNA registry statute to be constitutional both facially and as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Each of them filed with the secretary of state a declaration of candidacy to succeed himself or herself. In each case, the secretary of state refused to accept the declaration because it was filed late, according to a statute regarding judicial retention, 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7A-1 (2004). The judges then moved for summary judgment and claimed that the statutory provision was unconstitutional due to the time deadline set forth in Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 12(d) regarding judicial retention. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the state supreme court first addressed whether the statute was mandatory or directory, and found that it was mandatory because it set forth a consequence for a judge's failure to meet the deadline. It then found that the statute was facially unconstitutional because it was directly in conflict with the Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 12(d) given that the statute tried to change the time deadline for filing judicial retention declarations in that constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

The public act had shortened the time for filing a legal malpractice action. Defendants, an attorney and a law firm, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimants filed a legal malpractice action against the attorney and law firm. The claimants relied on the limitations period for malpractice actions set forth in a civil procedure statute, as amended by 1995 Ill. Laws 89-7. The attorney and law firm moved to dismiss and claimed that the state supreme court's decision in Best, holding 1995 Ill. Laws 89-7 void in its entirety, rendered their complaint untimely. The trial court, relying on the void ab initio doctrine, agreed and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The appellate court reversed and held that dismissal would be unfair, as the claimants had filed their complaint within three weeks of the Best decision being filed. On further review, the state supreme court found that by virtue of its Best decision, no time remained for them to file their complaint because it was instantaneously barred when the prior version of the law became operative again; thus, the state supreme court found that the void ab initio doctrine should not be applied and that the three weeks in which the claimants filed their complaint after Best was a reasonable time period for filing their legal malpractice action.</SPAN></P>

The Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission denied relief, and the decision was confirmed by a circuit court. The employer's subsequent appeal was dismissed, and it again sought review. In affirming the dismissal of the appeal, the state supreme court determined that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The Commission had jurisdiction for this purpose, but only for 30 months following the issuance of the award, pursuant to 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. 305/19(h) (2002). The state supreme court determined that the review sought by the employer was not appropriate for partial disability claims, even though they were authorized for claims of totally and permanently disabled persons under 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. 305/8(f) (2002). The state supreme court also rejected the argument that due process and rights under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;12 were violated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The truck driver's vehicle was involved in an auto accident with another vehicle carrying two people, in Indiana. The two people filed a personal injury lawsuit in an Indiana state court against the truck driver, truck owner, and truck lessee. The truck driver, truck owner, and truck lessee removed the case to the federal trial court. A physician who treated one of the two people stated in a deposition that defendant doctor's surgery performed on that person was unnecessary and exacerbated his injuries. The truck driver, truck owner, and truck lessee moved to file a third-party complaint for contribution against the doctor. A federal magistrate judge denied the motion. Thereafter, the truck driver, truck owner, and truck lessee filed a claim for contribution against the doctor in the Illinois state trial court. The trial court denied the doctor's motion to dismiss; the appellate court reversed. On further review, the state supreme court found that the contribution claim, pursuant to language in 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 100/5, could not be brought in the Illinois state court because it was not a third-party complaint filed in a pending action, as that statute required.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had found that there was no question of material fact that the doctor failed to fulfill her service obligation because neither the type of medicine she practiced nor the locations where she practiced satisfied the terms of the scholarship contracts and the Act. The court found no merit with regard to the doctor's assertion on appeal that an installment agreement that had been entered into merged all claims based on the scholarship contracts and, therefore, the Department was precluded from proceeding. To the contrary, the court found that the installment agreement was a payment plan, rather than a settlement, and that the doctor failed to maintain the installment payments in any regard. The court held that the doctor breached the contracts when she did not obtain approval of her post-residency fellowship and failed to serve as a doctor within a designated shortage area.</SPAN></P>

The trial court adjudged defendant an habitual criminal, and imposed seven natural-life sentences pursuant to the Habitual Criminal Act, 720 Ill. Comp.

However, the state supreme court held that the appellate court properly determined that natural-life sentences could not be imposed consecutively. The state supreme court found that it was physically impossible to serve consecutive sentences of natural life. Nor would the total amount of two or more natural-life sentences ever be more than defendant's one life. The state supreme court found that the purpose of the consecutive sentencing statute, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5-8-4, of removing from society criminals not capable of reform was not served by consecutive natural life sentences. The state supreme court exercised its authority under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615(b)(4) and imposed concurrent natural life sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the appellate court concerning the holding that the trial court erred in imposing natural-life sentences on each of defendant's remaining five convictions was reversed. The trial court's judgment on the convictions and natural-life sentences for each conviction was affirmed. However, the trial court's judgment that defendant served those sentences consecutively was reversed, and concurrent sentences were imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court allowed a petition by the State for review of a decision of the Appellate Court of Illinois that affirmed respondent juvenile's adjudication as delinquent after finding that he had committed acts that would have constituted murder if committed by an adult but reversed an adult sentence that had been imposed under the extended juvenile jurisdiction (EJJ) statute,&nbsp;705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/5-810 (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile had been 14 when he killed the victim. The trial court had denied the State's motion to try him as an adult, and the appellate court had affirmed the ruling. Nonetheless, to assure the juvenile's compliance with its disposition, it imposed an EJJ adult sentence, which would come into play only in the event of an unsuccessful juvenile disposition. Since the juvenile had complied and been released, the issue of the propriety of an EJJ sentence was moot, but the court addressed it as a matter of public interest. The EJJ issue and the transfer for trial as an adult issues involved distinct consideration of different statutory factors by a trial judge. Therefore, the decision not to grant discretionary transfer to an adult court had no law of the case effect on the trial court's ability to impose an EJJ sentence. The court also considered whether the juvenile's statements to police during custodial interrogation were properly admitted. Adopting the objective test used in federal constitutional case law, it held that the juvenile's question, &quot;Do I need a lawyer?,&quot; to which an officer made a noncommittal response, was not an unequivocal invocation of the right to counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the affirmance of the delinquency adjudication but reversed the portion of the appellate judgment that had reversed the EJJ sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The DuPage County Circuit Court (Illinois) permitted defendant to withdraw her guilty plea to a charge of unlawful possession of a stolen motor vehicle, denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charge against her, and then dismissed that charge anyway, on the ground that the permissive inference contained in 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-103 (2000) was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with unlawful possession of a stolen motor vehicle in violation of 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-103(a)(1) (2000). She subsequently pled guilty. Thereafter, she sought to withdraw her guilty plea and challenged the constitutionality of 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-103(a)(1) (2000), which provided that the trier of fact could infer that a person exercising exclusive unexplained possession over a stolen vehicle knew that the vehicle was stolen, regardless of when it was stolen. Defendant also argued that the charge should be dismissed based on double jeopardy because she had pled guilty to criminal trespass to the same vehicle in a proceeding in another county, and the unlawful possession of a stolen motor vehicle charge in the forum county was the same continuing transaction. The trial court allowed her to withdraw her guilty plea, denied her motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy, and found the permissive inference to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the state supreme court found the two charges were separate acts and that the trial court prematurely found the permissive inference to be unconstitutional because it might not even be applied to her case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state supreme court affirmed the trial court's judgment insofar as it allowed defendant to withdraw her guilty pled.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant saw a car that had been left running at a gas station. No one appeared to be inside it. Defendant drove away in the car and soon wrecked the vehicle. Defendant then saw that a young child was in the car's rear seat. Defendant was charged with, inter alia, aggravated kidnapping. Defendant's counsel allegedly asserted that the lack of awareness of the child in the car would not be a defense to an aggravated kidnapping charge. Counsel also allegedly informed defendant that he would receive a 25-year sentence if he was convicted on it. Defendant was then admonished by the trial court, pled guilty in return for dismissal of other charges, and was sentenced to six years in prison. Subsequently, defendant filed a pro se petition under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 et seq. (2000). The trial court granted the State's motion to dismiss that claimed a substantial showing was not made of a constitutional violation. On further review, the state supreme court found defendant had stated a constitutional claim and the State had not shown that the trial court's admonitions overcame defense counsel's alleged erroneous advice given to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Illinois General Assembly enacted 1994 Ill. Laws 88-669 entitled &quot;An Act in relation to government regulation.&quot; That law amended, among other statutes, the Illinois Income Tax Act, 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1301 (1994) (Act). Thereafter, the State charged defendants under the amended version of the Act with willfully violating the Act by filing fraudulent tax returns for two different tax years by listing their adjusted gross income as nothing in each of those years when they allegedly knew that the true amount was in excess of that figure. Defendants moved to dismiss the indictments on the ground that the Act, as amended, violated the single subject clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d). The trial court granted defendants' motions to dismiss. On appeal, the state supreme court first found that defendants had standing to challenge the Act despite the nine-year delay between enactment and their challenge to it because they were charged with violating it. The state supreme court then found that 1994 Ill. Laws 88-669 violated the single subject clause of the Illinois Constitution because that law dealt with many different and disparate subjects.</SPAN></P>

(2002), which abated the Illinois Commerce Commission's proceedings against appellant telephone company. The Madison County Circuit Court declared &sect; 13-502.5 invalid under the Illinois Constitution. The company sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the Commission's investigation of the company's rate hike was pending, the legislature enacted &sect; 13-502.5, which abated the Commission's case against the company; classified certain of the company's services as competitive, enabling it to increase rates; and obliged it to refund money to some customers and to fund a state program. The trial court held that &sect; 13-502.5 violated the special legislation clause of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 and the due process and equal protection clauses of Ill Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The supreme court disagreed. Any advantages the company may have received under the law were not denied to others who were similarly situated. As the company was uniquely situated, the special legislation clause did not bar enactment of a law tailored to address conditions presented by that unique situation. Further, the classification established by 220 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-502.5 was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Since &sect; 13-502.5 did not violate the special legislation clause, it did not violate the businesses' right to equal protection.

The state supreme court concluded that the program was a form of restraint that fell within the broad meaning of the term &quot;custody.&quot; Thus, as a participant in the program, defendant was in the &quot;custody&quot; of the Cook County Department of Corrections and the Department of Community Supervision and Intervention. Significant restraints were placed on defendant's liberty. He reported to a jail facility on a daily basis and was expected to be at the facility from 8 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. In addition, the state supreme court concluded that the definitions of bail and recognizance found in 725 Ill.

Ann. 5/102-6, 5/102-19, and 5/110-2 (2000), and the statutory framework providing for the release of a defendant on bail or recognizance, left no doubt that the trial court was responsible for setting and modifying bail and releasing a defendant on his or her own recognizance, not the county sheriff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Coles County (Illinois), defendant was convicted of first degree murder (720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(a) (2000)) and other crimes. The jury found him eligible for the death penalty, and that no mitigating factors precluded such a sentence. The circuit court sentenced him to death on the first degree murder conviction. Because he was sentenced to death, his appeal was brought directly to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, all issues were related to the propriety of the death sentence. Defendant first disputed the use of statements he made pertaining to uncharged offenses, that he had committed a murder and burned down an apartment building. The state supreme court found these statements were voluntary and were not made to police officers in a custodial setting, but were made to defendant's friends, with no prompting whatsoever. It was for the jury to decide whether they were the product of a &quot;poor sense of humor&quot; or genuine admissions of responsibility. Defendant also disputed the State's introduction of his Internet viewing of sexually explicit sites, nude photos of his girlfriends, his e-mail address, his tattoos, the books he possessed, his possession of guns, and his &quot;political&quot; statements. However, most, if not all, of the evidence was admissible under Dawson. To the extent that some evidence could have been improperly admitted, its admission was harmless in view of overwhelming aggravating evidence. The admission of a crime scene expert's testimony was harmless, as it was cumulative of testimony given by other witnesses, and any inferences drawn by the expert were commonsense ones.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed. The clerk of the court was directed to enter an order setting Monday, January 9, 2006, as the date on which the sentence of death was to be carried out. Defendant was to be executed in the manner provided by law. The clerk was to send a certified copy of the mandate to the Director of Corrections, the warden of Tamms Correctional Center, and the warden of the institution where defendant was confined.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was injured while working as a seaman on a harbor boat. A request for a jury trial was stricken by the circuit court. An appeal was filed after a bench trial, and the decision to deny a jury trial was affirmed. In reversing, the court determined that the &quot;election&quot; referred to in the Jones Act was not the seaman's election of a right to a jury trial, but his election to proceed at law, rather than in admiralty. There was a right to trial by jury in common law claims, but not those filed in admiralty. The court noted that it was not bound by federal court decisions since the exact issues were not decided by the United States Supreme Court. The Act did not give an exclusive right to the injured employee to elect a trial by jury in an action filed in state court. Next, the court held that the availability of a jury trial in cases brought under the Act was a question properly controlled by the laws of the forum. The right was guaranteed by Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 because jury trials had been held for injured seamen for many years. The Act was not a new cause of action at law because it merely removed the bar to common law suits created by the decision in The Osceola.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgments of both the appellate and the circuit court were reversed, and the case was remanded for a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

The public guardian filed an amended petition to set aside the deed, pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1401 (1994) and 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 200/22-45 (1994).</SPAN></P>

The investment corporation received a tax deed in 1993. At the close of the hearing, the trial court found that the redemption period had expired, that no redemption had been made, and that the investment corporation complied with applicable notice provisions by exercising due diligence in attempting to locate the incompetent. The public guardian asserted that the tax deed should have been set aside because there was clear and convincing evidence that it was procured by fraud or deception because two of the notices were returned in their envelopes with the notation that the addressee was mentally incompetent. The court disagreed and noted that the fact that the investment corporation submitted those two envelopes into evidence was a strong indication that there was no deceptive or fraudulent act on the part of the investment corporation. The court also noted that no provisions existed under statutory law to set aside a tax deed upon equitable principles.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(i) and (a)(1)(d)(ii) (2000) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court was correct in so concluding and asserted that the 25-to-life sentence enhancement suffered from the same defect in that such enhancement was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that it was impermissible for a defendant to challenge a penalty under the proportionate penalties clause by comparing it to the penalty for an offense with different elements. As such, the trial court erred in holding that the 15- and 20-year firearm enhancements to first degree murder were unconstitutional under the proportionate penalties clause.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-11(a)(3) (2000) was unconstitutional. In a separate case, defendant two appealed from an appellate court ruling that &sect; 12-11(a)(3), (c) did not violate the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;11 (1970). The appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both defendants had been charged with home invasion with a firearm under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-11(a)(3) (2000). Both defendants argued that the sentence for home invasion while in possession of a firearm was unconstitutionally disproportionate to the sentence for aggravated battery with a firearm. That argument failed because after the Sharpe decision, defendants could not challenge a penalty under the proportionate penalties clause by comparing it with the penalty for an offense with different elements. Defendant one also argued that &sect; 12-11(a)(3) constituted an impermissible double enhancement. The trial court agreed with defendant two that the presence of a firearm was used twice in the home invasion statute, first as an element of the offense and then again to enhance the offense with a 15-year sentencing add-on. The supreme court disagreed. Home invasion with a firearm was a distinct offense. However, the firearm factor was used only as an element of the offense under &sect;&nbsp;12-11(a)(3); it was not mentioned in the sentencing provision of &sect;&nbsp;12-11(c), which simply defined the sentence for the distinct crime in &sect;&nbsp;12-11(a)(3).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant state officials appealed a Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) summary judgment declaring the Illinois FY2004 Budget Implementation Act, 2003 Ill. Laws 32 (2003), violative of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 as applied to plaintiff employer. The employer had challenged the operation of new statutory provisions, in particular, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/416 (2004) and 30 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 105/8j (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">To meet a fiscal crisis, the legislature had enacted what were denominated as non-consumer user fees, imposed on groups of taxpayers that used certain state administrative services. 30 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 105/8j (2004) authorized transfers of portions of those fees into the general revenue fund, ostensibly to cover indirect costs of providing the services. The employer challenged a particular fee imposed on it under 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/416 (2004) as a purchaser of workers' compensation insurance. It claimed that it had been unfairly burdened in violation of the uniformity clause and that the fee violated due process. The court held that the employer had failed to meet the heavy burden imposed on those who claimed a statute was unconstitutional. It had not overcome the officials' showing that the distinction between employers and employees was rationally based on which parties were best positioned to pay for administration of the workers' compensation system. The fee itself had already been lowered, and there was simply too little evidence to find a confiscatory fee that violated due process. The employer's takings claim would be considered on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county appealed the judgment of the Appellate Court for the Fourth District (Illinois), which affirmed the circuit court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee village in its suit seeking declaratory judgment that the village, and not the county, had zoning and building code jurisdiction on areas subject to annexation agreements with the village and an injunction preventing the county from interfering with such agreements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Property owners in the county reached agreements with the village for the future annexation of their properties. When the county asserted that it had building code jurisdiction over the properties, the village successfully sought declaratory judgment that it, not the county, had zoning and building code jurisdiction over the properties. On review, the court affirmed, first finding that because the county was not affected by &sect; 15.1 of the Municipal Code, 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-15.1-2.1 (2002), it did not have standing to challenge its constitutionality. The court then found that under all versions of the often amended &sect; 15.1, 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-15.1-1, property subject to an annexation agreement within the county would be subject to the municipality's ordinances, control, and jurisdiction. The court then found that the legislature had determined that a municipality could exercise certain jurisdiction over property that was subject to an annexation agreement as of the time the agreement was entered into, rather than the time of annexation, and that such a determination was best left to the discretion of the legislature in the exercise of its police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff policyholders brought a class action against defendant insurance company, for breach of contract and statutory consumer fraud, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The jury found in their favor on the breach of contract and fraud claims. The circuit court granted declaratory relief but not injunctive relief. The Appellate Court (Illinois) affirmed, but reversed a part of the damages. The company's petition to appeal was allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The policyholders disputed the propriety of the company's practice of specifying the use of non-&quot;original equipment manufacturer&quot; crash parts to repair its policyholders' cars when such cheaper parts were available. The appeals court found the jury verdict on the breach of contract claim could not be affirmed. The jury was incorrectly instructed that the operative language in the insurer's various policy forms could be given a uniform interpretation. Further, the verdict could not be affirmed for any subclass of policyholders who were insured under any of the relevant individual policy forms. There was no basis in the law for specification damages. As to the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, the supreme court found that the circuit court erred in certifying a nationwide class that included class members whose claims proceedings took place outside Illinois. The only putative class that could exist was a class consisting of policyholders whose vehicles were assessed and repaired in Illinois. Because the representative policyholder had not proven his claim for consumer fraud, there could be no Illinois class for the policyholders' consumer fraud count.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the pleading should have been dealt with as labeled and that there was no provision for summary dismissal under the mandamus statute. The supreme court affirmed but held that 1) the circuit court had the option, under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1(d) (2002), of recharacterizing the pro se motion, regardless of how it was labeled; 2) in all future cases, where a circuit court wished to recharacterize a first postconviction pro se motion as one falling under the Act, the circuit court was required to notify the pro se litigant of the court's intention, to warn the litigant of the effect of the recharacterization on subsequent postconviction petitions, and to provide the litigant with an opportunity to withdraw or amend the pleading so that it contained all of the claims appropriate to a postconviction petition; and 3) as the inmate had not been given the opportunity to withdraw or amend, remand was required so that he could do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant underwriter was the lead underwriter for the forum county's issuance of bonds to refinance, at lower interest rates, some municipal bonds. Thereafter, the taxpayers filed a putative class action seeking to recover, on behalf of the forum county, overcharges made by the underwriter. Also included in the taxpayers' lawsuit were defendants, two financial advisors who allegedly gave advice. The complaint did not allege any county involvement in any of the alleged wrongdoing. The underwriter, the two financial advisors, and the county, as a nominal plaintiff, filed motions to dismiss. They challenged the taxpayers' standing. The trial court granted the motions to dismiss. On direct appeal, the state supreme court found that the State's Attorney had the exclusive power to represent the forum county in litigation where it was the real party in interest, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/20-104(b) (1998) was unconstitutional to the extent it purported to confer standing on the taxpayers, and no common law claim could be brought because no claim was made that a public official was responsible for any alleged injury and only the State's Attorney had the power to assert such a claim.</SPAN></P>

The repair person called the police officer and told him what he had seen. The officer viewed the video and agreed that it was child pornography. Defendant was arrested. A search of defendant's home revealed numerous other images of child pornography. The indictment against defendant was sufficiently precise to adequately inform defendant of the nature of the charges. The indictment charged him with possessing a photograph or other similar visual reproduction or depiction by computer. From this language, defendant should have understood that he was charged with possessing pornographic pictures of children. The disjunctive language in each count merely gave the State flexibility as to the physical form of the pictures. Defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied. The Fourth Amendment was not violated when the officer viewed the file as the officer's confirmation of what the repair person, a private citizen, saw on the file did not exceed the scope of the repair person's private search to which no Fourth Amendment protection attached.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the Illinois State Treasurer and a bank, appealed from a decision of an appellate court (Illinois), which affirmed a circuit court's judgment in favor of plaintiff buyers in a breach of contract action involving the buyers' attempts to purchase two hotel venture loans from the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The buyers tried to purchase venture loans that had been made from a state mortgage fund. The Treasurer failed to close on the agreements after the Illinois Attorney General withheld approval of them, based in part on his opinion that the Governor's consent was required before the transactions could go forward. On appeal, defendants contended, as they had in both lower courts, that the buyers were asserting a breach of contract action against the State that could only be brought in the Illinois Court of Claims. The court agreed, holding that the officer suit exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not apply. The fact that the Treasurer chose to adhere to the Attorney General's opinion did not violate Ill. Const. art. V, &sect; 18 (1970). The court expressed no opinion as to whether either approval of the buy-sell agreements by either the Governor or the Attorney General was needed. It simply held that the Treasurer had not acted outside the broad grant of authority given to her in &sect; 18 and, even if she had, her actions were not ultra vires. Thus, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/8(b) (2000) controlled, and the buyers' action could only be brought in the court of claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgments of both lower courts reversed, and the case was remanded to the circuit court with directions to dismiss the buyers' complaint.</SPAN></P>

The complaints included common law claims alleging fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, accountant malpractice, and fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation as well as claims under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/20-104(b) (2002) and the Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers filed their actions against defendant financial entities to recover, on behalf of the State, overcharges made in connection with certain state bond transactions. The issues on appeal dealt with the taxpayers' standing to bring their claims and the constitutionality of the qui tam provisions of the Whistleblower Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 175/1 et seq. (2002). Refusing to deviate from its holding in Lyons, the supreme court held that the taxpayers lacked standing to bring the common law claims because the State was the real party in interest on those claims and, therefore, only the Illinois Attorney General had standing to bring them. Also in accordance with Lyons, the taxpayers' claims under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/20-104(b) (2002) failed because that statute unconstitutionally usurped the Attorney General's powers. However, as the Attorney General retained authority to control any litigation under the qui tam provisions of the Whistleblower Act, the trial court erred in finding those provisions to be unconstitutional and in dismissing the taxpayers' qui tam claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with seven counts of possession of child pornography in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-20.1(a)(6) (2000). Three counts involved three Polaroid photographs of defendant's then 16-year-old former girlfriend. The remaining four charges were based on images contained on some computer disks that police seized from his home pursuant to a search warrant. The images were converted into photographs and were admitted into evidence. Following a bench trial, the trial court convicted defendant on six of the seven charges; it found reasonable doubt about whether the children depicted in the seventh charge were actually minors. The trial court's ruling was based on its viewing of the images themselves. The appellate court affirmed and stated that the convictions could be based on a viewing of the images themselves. On further review, the state supreme court found that the evidence sufficiently supported the convictions and that the trier of fact was capable of determining whether real children, as opposed to virtual images of them, were used in pornographic images simply by viewing the images themselves.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that the evidence was not sufficient to find her unfit. The mother conceded that she met three of the four bases for lack of fitness listed in 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(s) (2002), that the child was in the temporary custody of the Department of Children and Family Services, that she was incarcerated, and that she had been repeated incarcerated. However, the mother challenged the finding that her repeated incarceration prevented her from discharging her parental responsibility for the child. The supreme court noted that appellate court's decision was based on the mother's ability to discharge her parental responsibilities as shown by her experiences, including those after being released from prison. The record showed that the mother was a long-term substance abuser. Although the mother completed various classes concerning substance abuse, parenting, anger management, and grief, and attended Alcoholics Anonymous on a regular basis, the supreme court agreed that the mother failed to show that she had the capability to parent the child, who suffered from development deficits. The mother did not have the necessary skills or knowledge for such a challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An informant complained that three African-American men were selling drugs on a street corner. Most of the prior complaints from that citizen were well founded. When two police officers arrived at the scene, they saw defendant and two other African-American men standing on the street corner. One of the officers knew that defendant had been previously arrested for a drug offense. The other officer recognized one of the other two men as a gang member. The three men talked to a person inside a van that pulled up, until the van drove away. The officers drove up to the three men. After a pat-down search revealed nothing, the officers arrested defendant for violating a municipal drug-loitering ordinance. In a search incident to the arrest, the officers found cocaine on defendant. On appeal, the court found that the information provided by the informant was sufficient to justify the officers conducting an investigatory stop. However, the arresting officers lacked probable cause under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 to arrest defendant for violating the drug-loitering ordinance. Therefore, the circuit court should have suppressed the cocaine found incident to the arrest.</SPAN></P>

That was because the board also denied the policeman's application on the basis that the policeman failed &quot;to prove&quot; he was disabled and the appeals court did not address that alternative issue; if it had addressed that alternative issue and agreed with the board, then it would not have had to address the issue of (1) whether the policeman's application could be denied just because one of the three physicians failed &quot;to certify&quot; the policeman was disabled, and (2) the resulting question of whether the board's requirement, that all three physicians had to certify that the policeman was disabled, was constitutional (a question that the appeals court had resolved in favor of the board).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State charged defendant with two counts of domestic battery, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-3.2(a)(1), (a)(2) (2002). Defendant moved to dismiss the charges. Following an evidentiary hearing, the circuit court granted the motion to dismiss. The Circuit Court of Douglas County (Illinois) denied the State's motion to reconsider. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction for domestic battery was based on an incident involving a former girlfriend. Defendant and the victim dated for 10 months and lived together for four of those months. The incident occurred four months after the couple ended their relationship. On appeal, defendant argued that the definition of family or household members in 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-3.2(a)(1), (a)(2) (2002) was unconstitutionally vague because it did not place a time limit on the former relationship. The appellate court agreed with the State that the trial court clearly erred in holding the statute unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. Defendant fell within the definition of a family or household member on two separate bases: he and the victim had had a dating relationship and had shared a common dwelling. In addition, the appellate court found the prohibitions were sufficiently definite, when measured by common understanding and practice, to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair warning as to what conduct was prohibited. It was not unreasonable for the legislature to include within the domestic battery statute relationships that had been over for only a few months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's order holding the statute unconstitutional was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Illinois appellate court found in the case of respondent first mother that the statute used to conclusively presume her to be an unfit parent, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(q) (2000), violated her due process and equal protection clause rights. In a separate case, the Illinois appellate court upheld that statute's constitutionality. Petitioner State appealed in the first mother's case, and respondent second mother appealed in the other.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In two appeals, the state supreme court considered the constitutionality of 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(q) (2000), which provided a conclusive presumption of parental unfitness if the parent had been convicted of certain offenses. In the first case, the first mother was convicted of the attempted murder of her infant son. She later gave birth to another child. The State sought to have her found unfit based on the conviction and that statute. The trial court found her to be unfit; her parental rights were later terminated. On appeal, the appellate court found the statute violated her due process and equal protection rights. In the second case, the prior conviction was aggravated battery; the parental rights were also terminated under the statute. The appellate court found the statute to be constitutional. On further review, the state supreme court noted that the same or similar offenses listed under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(i) (2000) created only a rebuttable presumption of unfitness and violated the mothers' equal protection rights because the State could not show a compelling state interest existed in having different presumptions in similar statutory provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court's judgment finding that the statute was unconstitutional was affirmed. Its judgment in the second case finding that the statute was constitutional was reversed as was the underlying trial court decision terminating the second mother's parental rights. Both decisions found the mothers' equal protection rights were violated. Also, the second case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1203 (2000) postjudgment motion after the appellate court found that the trial court's order for issuance of a tax deed was incontestable and that a property owner could not file a postjudgment motion for reconsideration. The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners had a single-family residence which was sold to a company for taxes due. The company later transferred the property to appellant mortgage corporation. The mortgage corporation petitioned the trial court for a tax deed. The property owners did not redeem. The mortgage corporation applied for an order directing the county clerk to issue a tax deed. Eventually, the trial court ordered the county clerk to issue it. The property owners filed a 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1203 (2000) motion to vacate. Within 30 days of the trial court's denying the motion, the property owners filed a notice of appeal. The appellate court dismissed the appeal as untimely because it found, from the language of 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 200/22-45 (2000), that the order for issuance of a tax deed could only be challenged by a direct appeal or by a 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1401 (2000) motion for relief from judgment. On further appeal, the state supreme court found that the property owners could file a &sect; 2-1203 motion because the legislature, in drafting &sect; 2-1401, was only concerned about limiting collateral, but not direct, attacks on an order for issuance of a tax deed.</SPAN></P>

The party was held at the teaching assistant's apartment and lasted into the early hours of the morning.

Defendant answered, and agreed to the sergeant's request to find the host, but when he attempted to close the front door, the sergeant put his arm on the door to prevent it from being shut. Defendant objected to the sergeant's insistence that the door remain open and tried to slam it shut. The sergeant arrested defendant for obstructing a peace officer in violation of the municipal code. He was convicted, which was affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that as a mere party guest, defendant did not have standing to assert that the sergeant's actions were tantamount to an entry and a search of a private residence without a warrant in violation of U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff State sued defendants, a corporation and its president, over the alleged contamination of soil and groundwater. The circuit court awarded remediation costs and imposed a civil penalty, but refused to enter a mandatory injunction requiring defendants to clean up the contamination. The State and defendants appealed. The Illinois appellate court affirmed the denial of injunctive relief. The State sought further review on this issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were in the business of applying fertilizers and pesticides to farm fields. The circuit court found that defendants caused soil, groundwater, and wells to be contaminated by pesticides. The circuit court refused to order defendants to clean up the site, finding that it had no authority under former 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/42(e) (2002) of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1 et seq. (2002), to issue a mandatory injunction. The appellate court affirmed; six months later, the legislature amended 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/42(e) to provide for mandatory injunctions. The supreme court held that, based on the plain and ordinary meaning of the word &quot;restrain,&quot; former &sect; 5/42(e) did not allow mandatory injunctions. Further, under the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, the legislature could not retroactively alter a statute to overrule a decision of a reviewing court. The amendment to &sect; 5/42(e) was not a retrospective &quot;clarification&quot; of existing law, but was instead a change in the law. A subsequent amendment to a statute could not replace the plain meaning as the best evidence of the legislature's original intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with unlawful failure to register as a sex offender in violation of &sect; 3(b) of the Sex Offender Registration Act (730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/3(b) (2002)). He moved to dismiss, arguing the Act, and the Sex Offender and Child Murderer Community Notification Law, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 152/101 et seq. (2002), was unconstitutional. The Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) granted dismissal. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 2000 the Notification Law was amended by adding &sect; 115(b), 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 152/115(b) (2002), requiring the state police to post Statewide Sex Offender Database on the Internet. Defendant claimed the dissemination of his photograph and physical attributes on an Internet page violated his privacy rights. The supreme court found that as the sex offender registry information was already open to the public and was a matter of public record, defendant's registry information was not &quot;private&quot; and did not fall within the Illinois Constitution's privacy clause protections. On defendant's substantive due process challenge, the court found there was a rational relationship between the disclosure of sex offender registration information via the Internet and the goals of protecting the general public and assisting law enforcement. Defendant failed to present any reasoned or developed argument with respect to his equal protection challenge. Informed by the analysis of the U.S. Supreme Court in Smith v. Doe, the supreme court found defendant failed to meet his burden to clearly show that &sect; 115(b) violated the ex post facto provisions of the United States or Illinois constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff prisoner sought an order of habeas corpus alleging his extended-term sentence was unconstitutional under Apprendi and he was entitled to immediate release as he had served the maximum nonextended term to which he could have been sentenced. The Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois) held the statute authorizing his extended-term sentence was unconstitutional under Apprendi and issued the habeas corpus order. Defendant warden appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner was sentenced to concurrent extended terms of 60 years each for armed robbery and armed violence. On direct appeal, he challenged the extended-term sentences on the ground that the sentencing judge did not find any of the aggravating factors listed in the statute. The appellate court had rejected that argument and noted that the record supported an extended term under the Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-3.2(b)(2) (1979) factor that the offense was accompanied by exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty as the prisoner had repeatedly threatened the victim's life with a knife and severely beat her even though she told him she was pregnant. As to the habeas corpus action, the appellate court held Apprendi did not apply retroactively because it was a procedural rule and it was not among those procedures that were implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. The prisoner's direct appeal concluded some 15 years before Apprendi was decided. Nothing in the extended term statute prohibited compliance with Apprendi. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 1005-3.2(b)(2) was not void ab initio. The trial court erred in granting habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In vacating the trial court's order denying defendant's motion to suppress, the appellate court held that the prosecution deprived defendant of due process by refusing to grant use immunity to a witness at the suppression hearing. In reversing the appellate court, the supreme court concluded that the witness's testimony at the suppression hearing was not necessary to establish any legitimate expectation of privacy in the search of the boxes and seizure of contraband that defendant may have had. The supreme court noted that defendant could have testified at the suppression hearing on the issue of his expectation of privacy in the contents of the boxes without fear that his testimony would later be used to convict him. Although defendant complained that the testimony could have been used to impeach him if he testified at trial, the supreme court held that such alleged inconvenience did not, itself, provide a sufficient basis upon which to insist that the prosecution should have granted the witness use immunity at the suppression hearing so that he could have established defendant's ability to claim a Fourth Amendment violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner father was granted leave to appeal a decision of an appellate court (Illinois), which affirmed a trial court decision that a preexisting agreement granting grandparent visitation rights had not been rendered invalid based on a subsequent finding that the grandparent visitation statute,&nbsp;750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/607(b) (2000) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent grandparents were granted visitation rights under a consent order with the father. The father later sought modification of the order or a finding that it was no longer valid. The appellate court certified the question of whether Illinois courts had jurisdiction to enforce a grandparent visitation order entered prior to the decision in Wickham v. Byrne, or whether as a result of that decision, such a visitation agreement was rendered void. The supreme court noted that its basic ruling in Wickham was that the state could not override the decision of a fit parent regarding a child's visitation with grandparents. However, in the instant case, the state had not made that decision. The parties had entered into what was basically a consent decree, which in general could not be modified without the consent of all of the parties. As the agreement was not clearly contrary to public policy, it could not be rendered void on a public policy basis. Further, as the visitation was by agreement, it was not open to scrutiny under the principles stated in Wickham. However, modification was appropriate if there was a finding that modification would be in the grandchild's best interest.</SPAN></P>

Further, the appellate court found that the suggested benefits of the treatment outweighed the potential for harm, the patient lacked the capacity to make a reasoned decision about the treatment, and other less restrictive services had been explored, but were found inappropriate. The supreme court held that the patient was denied due process because the requirements for an independent examination under 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-804 (2000) were not satisfied. In addition, the supreme court held that 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-107.1 (2000) required that notice of the proceeding be given to the patient's criminal defense attorney.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother challenged a decision of the Illinois Appellate Court which affirmed the trial court's order that terminated the mother's custody of the parties' minor child, awarded custody to appellee father, and restricted the mother's visitation rights. The father cross-appealed the denial of his petition to terminate unallocated maintenance and support based on an alleged conjugal relationship between the mother and another man.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Custody was granted to the mother, and after both parties and the child went through psychological evaluations, the court-appointed psychologist recommended that custody be given to the father. The mother contended that &sect; 506 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/506 (2002), was unconstitutional. The court agreed that &sect; 506(a)(3) was unconstitutional as applied because the child's representative's report was adverse to the mother and she was deprived of her due process to cross-examine the witness. However, the court held that the mother presented no evidence to rebut the report and thus it was harmless error. The court also held that whatever the merits of the parental alienation syndrome (PAS) theory, the trial court's ruling was not dependent on any finding that PAS was present. The balance struck by the trial court by not interviewing the child in camera was not an abuse of discretion. As to the father's calling of a surprise witness, the mother did not demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the testimony. Finally, the court held the mother and the other man were in a dating relationship not akin to a marriage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county filed a petition for demolition pursuant to 55 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-1121 (West 2000). Defendants asserted that the statute was unconstitutional, citing Village of Lake Villa v. Stokovich, 334 Ill. App. 3d 488, 778 N.E.2d 750 (2002), in which the appellate court found 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-31-1 (West 1996) unconstitutional. Defendants argued that the authority that was given to county boards in section 5-1121 of the County Code paralleled that which was given to municipalities in section 11-31-1 of the Municipal Code. Specifically, they argued that, under Stokovich, a statute that allowed demolition upon findings that the structure was dangerous and beyond reasonable repair, without allowing repairs, constituted an unlawful taking. Defendants' motion to dismiss was granted. Subsequently, in Village of Lake Villa v. Stokovich, 211 Ill. 2d 106, 810 N.E.2d 13 (2004), the court held that section 11-31-1 of the Municipal Code was not unconstitutional because the procedure was rationally related to the public interest in health and safety and because the method that was chosen to further that interest was reasonable. Therefore, the circuit court's judgment was vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and its director (Agency), appealed a decision by an appellate court (Illinois) affirming summary judgment in favor of appellee company on its declaratory action that its manufacturing processes were not &quot;wastes&quot; under the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1 et seq. (2002). The company challenged summary judgment rejecting its claim for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Agency issued a violation notice under &sect; 31(a)(1) of the Act, 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/31(a)(1) (1998), for the company's failure to secure a permit to burn alternate fuel at one of its plants. When the parties could not agree on whether the alternate fuel was &quot;waste&quot; under the Act, the company sought a declaration that the fuel was not waste and for attorney fees under the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, 5 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 100/1-1, based on the Agency's allegedly impermissible rule-making. The parties cross-appealed summary judgment for the company on the declaratory action and for the Agency on attorney fees. The Agency argued that the declaratory action was not justiciable and the fuel was &quot;discarded material&quot; under the Act's definition of waste. The court found that the case was ripe and justiciable since an actual controversy existed and hardship would result if the declaratory action were not resolved. Since the fuel was recycled, it was not &quot;discarded&quot; and was not &quot;waste&quot; that would require a permit. The Agency's interpretation of &quot;discarded material&quot; was not a statement of general applicability, so no rule-making occurred to trigger the right to fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1999, a bank delivered the stockholder's stock to defendants pursuant to the Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act (Act), 765 Ill.

The stockholder learned of the remittance of the stock to the State in 1999 and submitted a claim for the return of the stock along with any dividends or other accruals that had been issued during the time the State held the stock. The State Treasurer returned the stock, but refused to return the dividends issued on the stock. The stockholder sued, and the trial court dismissed the suit based on the stockholder's failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The appellate court reversed and remanded. On appeal, the court affirmed, first finding that because defendants never chose to exercise their discretion in favor of a claimant, exhaustion of administrative remedies was unnecessary. It then found that &sect; 15 of the Act was not an escheat law and that the State, as the custodian of stock, could not claim that it was entitled to the dividends, which were an incident of ownership and belonged to the stockholder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Illinois appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois), which dismissed one count of an information against defendant, charging him with violating 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-103.2(b) (2002). Defendant was charged with theft, attempted first degree murder, and aggravated unlawful failure to obey a peace officer's order to stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two police officers testified that defendant opened a cash register drawer in a store while the clerk was elsewhere, and he took a deposit bag containing cash. He was chased out of the store and upon passing an automobile with the engine running, he got in and tried to escape, but he was eventually caught. Prior to trial, defendant sought dismissal of the aggravated failure to obey charge, contending that &sect; 4-103.2(b) was unconstitutional because a stolen vehicle was not a rational basis for a separate anti-flight offense, and because it was disproportionate to other offenses. The trial court held that it was unconstitutional on its face and it granted the motion, and after denying the State's motion for reconsideration, the State appealed. The court found that defendant had failed to demonstrate that the inference of 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-103(a)(1) (2002), which was incorporated in 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-103.2(b), violated due process as applied to him. There was no question that defendant's possession of the vehicle was recent, which was a key factor in permitting the inference and upholding its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The delinquent minor was a special education student within the school district. He was originally placed in an in-state residential facility but was discharged for numerous violations. The delinquent minor's probation officer recommended the out-of-state therapeutic residential placement in view of the delinquent minor's problems with school attendance, counseling, and probation department appointments. An advocacy supervisor from the county juvenile probation department testified that placement at the out-of-state facility was appropriate. The trial court found that the school district was liable for the educational portion of the delinquent minor's residential placement, since the minor's mother resided in that school district. The school district successfully appealed that decision, and the appellate court held that the trial court had no authority to order the school district to pay for such placement. The court agreed and held that the school district was financially liable only if it was unable to meet a special education student's needs, which was not the case. The placement of the delinquent minor was solely under the Juvenile Court Act, not the school code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a mother and the attorney general, appealed from an order of the Kane County Circuit Court (Illinois) holding the Illinois Parentage Act, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 45/1 et seq. (2000), unconstitutional and dismissing with prejudice a petition to determine a father-child relationship brought by plaintiff petitioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue the supreme court faced was whether &sect; 7(a) of the Act, codified at 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 45/7(a) (2002), was facially invalid to the extent that it permits, without a prior best interests hearing, a paternity action to be brought by a man alleging himself to be the biological father of a child who was born during the marriage of the mother to another man. Appellee husband argued that, by not providing for a preliminary best interests hearing, the statute was unconstitutional because it permitted the automatic invasion of an intact family by a stranger and allowed an interloper to involuntarily invade the marital relationship and impugn its integrity. The supreme court held that the husband failed to carry his burden of clearly showing that in all instances the failure to hold a best interests hearing before allowing a paternity action to proceed would be unconstitutional. The situations proposed by the husband made numerous assumptions and suggested various situations wherein the statute might be unconstitutionally applied. In addition, the husband's arguments regarding the social and public policy of the Act were better left for the legislature than to the courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following the completion of his sentence for criminal sexual assault, respondent was committed to the Illinois Department of Human Services. In connection with a mandatory reexamination procedure under the Illinois Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, respondent, who did not attend a probable cause hearing, requested through his attorney the appointment of an independent evaluator. The circuit court denied the request, and, based on the examining expert's report, found that respondent remained a sexually violent person and that no probable cause existed to warrant a hearing on the issue. On appeal, the supreme court found that the appointment of an independent examiner in periodic examination proceedings was controlled by 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/55(a) (2000) of the Act and was left to the discretion of the circuit court. Further, respondent was not denied equal protection by operation of section 55(a). Lastly, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/65(b)(1) (2000) of the Act, which prohibited committed persons from attending limited probable cause hearings, did not violate due process. The appellate court judgment was therefore improper, and the circuit court decision was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/5-125 (2002) violated equal protection because it allowed municipalities to treat similarly situated minors differently by allowing them to choose arbitrarily between referring ordinance violations involving minors to the State for prosecution under the Illinois Juvenile Court Act, which offered procedural protections, or filing their own complaint under the Illinois Municipal Code, which offered no such protections. The supreme court held that &sect; 5-125 did not violate equal protection as the differential in treatment was not arbitrary. Defendants also argued that their uncounseled guilty pleas violated due process. Since defendants did not receive sentences of detention, or even probation, the supreme court concluded that they were not entitled to appointed counsel when they pled guilty. However, the supreme court did hold that in the absence of a statute allowing such a procedure, contempt could not be used as punishment for minors who violated orders of supervision entered on municipal ordinance violations which themselves did not permit imprisonment. The cities improperly attempted to expand the sentencing options available.</SPAN></P>

The testimony defendant sought to introduce was not regarding prior sexual activity between himself and the victim, nor was the introduction of the testimony constitutionally required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Livingston County (Illinois) of three counts of predatory criminal sexual assault pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-14.1(a)(1) (2002). The circuit court determined that &sect; 12-14.1(b)(1.2) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant in that it violated the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and sentenced him to consecutive 10-year sentences. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convictions were based on allegations that defendant, who was a teacher, sexually assaulted three different students. Reversing the finding that &sect; 12-14.1(b)(1.2) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant, the state supreme court held that &sect; 12-14.1(b)(1.2) did not violate the proportionate penalties clause. The state supreme court found that the mandatory penalty of a natural life sentence was not cruel, degrading, or disproportionate to the offenses committed because (1) defendant committed sexual assaults against three victims, one more than the minimum &sect; 12-14.1(b)(1.2) required; (2) defendant had previously committed a &quot;sex offense;&quot; (3) the commission of the subject offenses appeared to have been the result of planning and well-orchestrated execution, on two separate dates, a month apart; and (4) even if defendant was truly remorseful, that was hardly a determinative factor with respect to the prospect of rehabilitation. Moreover, the court rejected defendant's suggested proportionality comparison to the offense of aggravated battery of a child because the two different offenses did not share a common statutory purpose and involved different kinds of injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state supreme court reversed the circuit court's decision and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Illinois appellate court ruled that state pension law required a one-time early retirement option contribution from the employer to be taken into account when calculating appellee retired professor's retirement annuity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retired professor elected to retire from the state university under the early retirement provisions of 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/15-136.2 (1992). To avoid a reduction in his retirement annuity, that law authorized him to make a one-time contribution to the state university retirement system. The law also stated that if the employee elected to make that early retirement option (ERO) contribution, the employer was obligated to contribute a lump sum to the system. The retired professor did not make an employee ERO contribution. Instead, the state university, made both the employee and employer contributions. The state university retirement system did not take into account the lump sum payment in calculating his retirement annuity. He sued to challenge the annuity calculation. The trial court agreed with the state university retirement system's calculation, but the appellate court disagreed with it. On appeal, the state supreme court found statutory interpretation of the state pension law did not require that the state university retirement system take into account the state university's one-time early retirement option contribution in calculating his retirement annuity.</SPAN></P>

Also, the trial court's judgment awarding attorney fees and expenses to the retired professor's attorneys was reversed, while its dismissal of the retired professor's other claims was affirmed. Also, the cause was remanded with directions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the Illinois Governor and the Comptroller, sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which was in favor of plaintiff class of judges and held that 2001 Ill. Laws 607 was invalid for violating Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14, and that Illinois judges were entitled to receive cost-of-living-adjustments (COLAs) as a component of their salaries for 2003 and 2004.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Compensation Review Board determined in 1990 that judge salaries should include COLAs, which were to be annually adjusted. The General Assembly suspended the COLAs implemented by Senate Joint Resolution 192. This was deemed a violation of Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14 and was remedied by new legislation for COLA payments in 2003. The Governor signed a reduction veto to the COLA-authorizing legislation for 2004 in order to prevent the COLA from being implemented, as well as a veto of the bill for 2003 COLAs. The Comptroller was ordered to make the payments upon the court's finding that the veto was unconstitutional, however, he refused. A class action by judges was brought against them. The trial court found that the elimination of the COLAs was unconstitutional, and it ordered payment to the class of judges. On appeal, the court found that the COLAs were fully vested since 1990 and accordingly, efforts to prevent receipt of them violated Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14. Accordingly, 2001 Ill. Laws 607 was invalid, as was the reduction veto. A defense of legislative immunity was inapplicable. The judiciary had authority to compel payment without a specific appropriation.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Rock Island County (Illinois) imposed an extended-term sentence of 100 years in prison.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the issue was whether an Apprendi claim that was waived pursuant to a guilty plea could nevertheless be considered on appeal under the plain error exception to the waiver rule. The state supreme court concluded that the appellate court erred in using Ill. Sup. Ct.

Moreover, Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615(a) did not speak to waivers that resulted from the voluntary relinquishment of known rights, as in the case of a guilty plea. Thus, the appellate court had no authority to forgo the administrative convenience of waiver and reach the merits of defendant's Apprendi claims, as administrative convenience had absolutely nothing to do with the waiver at issue in the case.</SPAN></P>

The suspension was upheld by the Illinois Secretary of State. Rather than seek further review, the driver filed his action seeking a declaration that &sect; 11-501.8 was unconstitutional. The circuit ruled in the driver's favor, leading to the State's appeal. The supreme court reversed. Persons faced with summary suspension of driving privileges under the zero tolerance law were not similarly situated with persons faced with summary suspension for driving while under the influence (DUI) for purposes of equal protection. Thus, equal protection did not require the driver to be afforded the same type of judicial hearing to contest the summary suspension as he would have had for a DUI arrest. Further, the administrative hearing process under the zero tolerance law afforded the driver with substantially the same due process as a DUI judicial hearing and was not constitutionally unsound.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat.

The supreme court held that as &sect; 44(p)(1)(A) did not implicate First Amendment rights and defendants did not allege the statute was incapable of any valid application, they had no standing to assert a facial vagueness challenge, and the trial court erred in finding &sect; 44(p)(1)(A) unconstitutionally vague on that basis. The trial court did not find the statute incapable of any valid application, and defendants presented no evidence demonstrating how the disputed statutory sections were vague as applied to their conduct.

Laws 38, which amended provisions of the Liquor Control Act, the State Finance Act, and the School Construction Law, was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs, a class of taxpayers cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute amended 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/8-1 (2000) by raising the state liquor tax, which was levied on manufacturers and importing distributors of alcoholic beverages. The taxpayer who headed the class challenged the law as a retail purchaser of vodka. The trial court ruled that the statute violated the three readings rule and the single subject clauses of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d) (1970). Without reaching the constitutional question, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed on a finding of lack of standing, holding that (1) the taxpayer paid the increased price voluntarily; (2) the taxpayer could not establish payment of the tax under implied duress because vodka was not an essential good and he went forward with a purchase of vodka with full knowledge of the tax; (3) the distributor was the only entity eligible to protest the tax under the State Officers and Employees Money Disposition Act, 30 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 230/1 et seq. (2000), and it had made it clear it had not desire to do so, and (4) even if the taxpayer could have sought a refund under the Act, he had failed to comply with the procedures set out in the Act for seeking a refund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff state employee sued defendant state employees, alleging they conspired to force him out of his job and that he endured mental anguish and derogation of his name and reputation as a result of their actions. The Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) granted defendants' motion to dismiss. A divided appellate court (Illinois) affirmed the dismissal. The state supreme court granted plaintiff's petition for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two defendants filed charges with the state police, accusing plaintiff of threatening them with physical violence. Plaintiff claimed these charges were false at the time they were made. Plaintiff claimed that the other two defendants conspired to force him out of his job with a threat of a state police investigation. On appeal, the primary issue was whether the doctrine of sovereign immunity deprived circuit courts of jurisdiction over claims that state employees engaged in civil conspiracy in the furtherance of which unlawful acts were committed. The state supreme court concluded that the doctrine of sovereign immunity was not designed to shield state employees from being held accountable for their criminal actions. Thus, the first two defendants were not immune from plaintiff's suit. Nor was sovereign immunity intended to shield even otherwise lawful actions by state employees, when those actions were committed in the furtherance of a conspiracy. Thus, the second two defendants were not protected by the doctrine. However, plaintiff failed to allege any facts from which the existence of a conspiracy could be inferred with respect to the second two defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state supreme court reversed in part the judgment of the appellate court which dismissed the two counts of plaintiff's complaint against the first two defendants, but affirmed in part the judgment of the appellate court which dismissed the two counts against the second two defendants. The cause was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the teacher's due process rights were violated by a combination of the Department's use of the credible-evidence standard of proof with the Department's failure to strictly comply with its statutory and regulatory deadlines in processing the administrative appeal. The supreme court found that the Department violated the teacher's due process rights through the combination of the Department's use of the low credible-evidence standard to indicate the report against the teacher and to deny his first-stage appeal and through the delays in the provision of the hearing and of the final administrative decision.

That decision was rendered in defendant property owner's appeal of a demolition order entered by a circuit court pursuant to &sect; 11-31-1.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court then found &sect; 11-31-1&nbsp;unconstitutional. The Illinois Supreme Court disagreed, holding that (1) the owners' failure to timely comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 19 was not fatal to their constitutional attack on 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-31-1 (1996), and the owners had standing to bring their constitutional claim; (2) &sect; 11-31-1 was an exercise of state police power subject to the rational basis level of scrutiny; (3) &sect; 11-31-1 provided the owners with procedural due process; (4) &sect; 11-31-1, as construed by the supreme court in a prior decision, was a constitutional exercise of police power; (5) demolition of property under &sect; 11-31-1 was not an unconstitutional taking; but (6) the circuit court's order had to be vacated because its finding that the building was beyond reasonable repair was not supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The intermediate appellate court then found that defendant's guilty plea over closed circuit television violated his constitutional right to be present at a critical stage of the proceeding. The appellate court ruled that a guilty plea did not waive a contention that the plea itself was involuntary because of faulty admonishments. Such claims could be raised for the first time in a postconviction petition. An appearance at a guilty plea proceeding via closed circuit television was constitutionally permissible only if the accused waived the right to physical presence on the record after being advised of his right to be present. Here, defendant did not specifically waive his right to be bodily in the courtroom. Defendant's physical presence would have contributed to the fairness of the proceeding, and thus, his due process right to be present at the proceeding was violated. An admonishment about the right to be physically present should have been given at the beginning of the guilty plea proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Ann. 450/30.2 (1994) had a neutral impact on application of the audit interference doctrine, which was properly applied by the trial court; (2) statements made by the board to the firm in a representation letter were sufficient to support the denial of the board's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of comparative fault; but (3) the firm was entitled to a setoff under the Joint Tortfeasor Contribution Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 100/0.01 et seq. (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed the appellate court's affirmance of the denial of a setoff and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to credit the firm with the full amount of the settlement with the joint tortfeasor. The supreme court otherwise affirmed the appellate court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the State and the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), appealed from a judgment of the appellate court (Illinois) reversing the circuit court's order terminating the parental rights of appellee father and appointing the DCFS as guardian of the child with the power to consent to adoption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first issue before the supreme court was whether the father's appeal was moot since he had executed a surrender of his parental rights several days prior to consideration of his appeal. The supreme court concluded that the appeal was not moot because the question of whether circuit courts were required, under former 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/1-5(3), to admonish parents that they risked termination of parental rights if the failed to cooperate with the DCFS was one of public importance, and the circumstances were likely to recur. As for the father's argument that the circuit court denied him due process by failing to admonish him that he risked losing his parental rights if he failed to cooperate with the DCFS, the supreme court concluded that he was not, based on the former law which was applicable in his case. Among other things, the supreme court noted that the risk that the father was erroneously deprived of his parental interest as a result of the failure to give the admonishment in question was minimal because the record amply demonstrated that the father was aware of the need to cooperate with the DCFS and that his parental rights could be terminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Illinois Department of Professional Regulation appealed directly from a Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois) judgment in plaintiff chiropractor's consolidated actions seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and review of a Department decision reprimanding and imposing penalties on the chiropractor for violating 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 60/26 (1998). The trial court had found several sections of the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The chiropractor's advertisements indicated he was a certified brain stem specialist. Since there was no certification board in medicine or chiropractic for that specialty (it was a program at his training college), the Illinois Medical Disciplinary Board commenced a proceeding against him, based on the Department's argument that the claims were misleading. When the chiropractor objected to the chiropractic representative on the Board, the Board nominated a temporary substitute, although the chiropractor did not approve of him either. The high court held that because the substitution was not made with the approval of the Governor, as required by 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 60/7 (1998), the disciplinary decision was invalid. The proper remedy was remand for reconsideration by a legally constituted Board. For guidance in further proceedings, the high court also considered the chiropractor's constitutional arguments. Most of these required further development on remand, but the high court did uphold the constitutionality of the composition of the Board, with only one chiropractor, as well as the fairness of procedures used in disciplinary proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the determination that the imposition of discipline was invalid, but instead of granting the relief sought by the chiropractor, it reversed the remedial portion of the judgment and remanded the matter to the Department for reconsideration by a properly constituted medical disciplinary board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner father sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Putnam County (Illinois) which denied his petition to revoke letters of administration issued to respondent maternal grandmother. The Illinois Appellate Court reversed the circuit court's order and remanded the cause for a hearing. The Illinois Supreme Court granted the grandmother's petition for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father had a conjugal relationship with the grandmother's daughter. The daughter, eight months pregnant, was killed in a car wreck. The fetus was stillborn. The grandmother settled a claim with the car's insurer and then sought court approval to execute the settlement and distribute the proceeds. The father thereafter filed a petition to revoke the letters of administration. He asserted he was the baby's natural father and, as such, was entitled to priority in the granting of letters of administration. The supreme court held it was correct for a probate estate to be created. However, 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-2 (1998) had no relevance in determining whether the father was a &quot;parent&quot; within the meaning of 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3 (1998) such that he took precedence over the grandmother for purposes of administering the baby's estate. The supreme court agreed with the appellate court, albeit for different reasons, that a hearing to determine whether the father was the baby's natural father was appropriate. It rejected the contention that, because stillborn fetuses never live, illegitimate fathers of stillborns could not establish themselves as &quot;eligible parents.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant car dealership appealed a decision of an appellate court (Illinois), which reversed a trial court decision that had found no constitutional infirmity in certain amendments to the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/1 et seq. (1996). Specifically, the trial court held that certain amendments to 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/10a (1996) did not violate Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff car buyer sued the dealership in connection with the purchase of a used vehicle but failed to comply with certain presuit notice requirements of the Act. The trial court held against the buyer and the appellate court reversed, holding that Ill. Pub. Act 87-1140 (1993) and Ill. Pub. Act 89-144 (1996), which amended 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/10a (1996), violated the constitutional prohibition against special legislation,&nbsp;Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13. On appeal, the court agreed that the amendments were unconstitutional.&nbsp;815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/10a (1996), as amended, divided consumer fraud plaintiffs into two groups, those defrauded by vehicle dealers, who were subject to the statutory amendments, and all other defrauded consumers who were not subject to the amendments. At bottom, the amendments placed vehicle dealers on more advantageous footing than all other retailers subject to the Act, thus creating a favored class. The statutory amendments were not simply part of the legislature's ongoing regulation of automobile sales and, rather than protecting consumers from unethical business practices of vehicle dealers, protected vehicle dealers from legitimate claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On remand, defendant argued that the Crane decision required a specific lack-of-control finding. The state supreme court disagreed, concluding that Crane did not hold that the U.S. Constitution required a specific determination by the fact finder in every case that a person lacked volitional control because Crane upheld the commitment in Hendricks as constitutional, even though there was no specific lack-of-control determination in Hendricks. The Illinois Act conformed to Hendricks and Crane because it required proof of the commission of a prior offense and contained definitions that supplied the constitutionally required elements for civil commitment. A fact finder properly instructed with the necessary definitions did not need to receive additional separate instruction on lack of control. Defendant's jury was properly instructed with definitions of the statutory terms relevant to his case so as to avoid any constitutional impediment. Thus, defendant's commitment did not run afoul of substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The supreme court began by concluding that a probation search of the probationer upon no individualized suspicion would be constitutionally unreasonable; thus, the officers were authorized to search defendant's motel room only if they had reasonable suspicion of a probation violation by the probationer. Based on information the officers received from three sources, the officers had a reasonable basis to investigate whether the probationer had changed residences without prior notification to her probation officer in violation of her probation. However, the officers were only authorized to check whether the probationer was in fact in defendant's room. The officers' search between the mattress and box springs, for example, was beyond the permissible scope of the probation search. Thus, the search was constitutionally unreasonable in its scope.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State was granted an appeal from an appellate court (Illinois) decision after defendant appealed the sentence that was imposed after he pleaded guilty to unauthorized theft involving a victim over the age of 60. The appellate court ruled that the penalty for unauthorized theft from a victim over age 60 was unconstitutionally disproportionate to the penalty for theft by deception from a victim of age 60 and vacated defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant misappropriated a check entrusted to him by a 71-year-old man and his 93-year-old mother. He pleaded guilty to unauthorized theft of more than $ 10,000 but not more than $ 100,000. Because of the victims' ages, he was sentenced to an extended term under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(4)(ii), 5/5-8-2 (2000). In the appellate court, defendant argued that his sentence violated the Proportionate Penalties Clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970) because the penalty for unauthorized theft, seven to 14 years, was greater than the three to seven year penalty for the identical crime of theft by deception from a victim over age 60 found at 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(5) (2000). The appellate court agreed, finding that because the crimes carried identical elements, the difference in sentence was unconstitutional. The court reversed. The elements of the crimes were not identical. One required a showing of unauthorized control over the victim's property while the other required a showing that control over the property was obtained through deception. As the elements were not identical, the differing penalties were constitutionally sound.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed that portion of the appellate court decision that ruled that the two penalties were unconstitutionally disproportionate. The court affirmed the remainder of the appellate court decision. The court remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Auditor General of the State of Illinois appealed directly from a Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) summary judgment declaring that &sect; 3-1 (30 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-1 (2000)) of the Illinois Auditing Act, 30 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-1 (2000), violated Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An amendment to 30 Ill. Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-1 (2000) specifically directed the Auditor General to conduct an audit of the City's airport operations. The trial court held that such an audit was on its face in excess of the Auditor General's constitutional powers, but the high court held that the statute, as written, did not necessarily exceed the scope of Ill. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 powers, so long as the audit was limited to the use of funds appropriated by the State for the City's use in running the airports. The constitutional violation occurred, instead, in the application of the statute to the proposed audit of the airports, since, in point of fact, they received no State funds at all. Although certain federal grants were paid first to the State and then passed on to the airport, they were never funds appropriated by the State within the meaning of the constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed the decision of an appellate court (Illinois), which ruled that respondent juvenile's failure to file an Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile pleaded guilty to a burglary charge and was adjudicated as a juvenile delinquent and a ward of the court. After committing the juvenile to the Illinois Department of Corrections, the trial court advised the juvenile that he had a right to appeal but that if he appealed, he was required to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or a motion to reconsider his sentence. The juvenile appealed but no motion to withdraw the guilty plea or to reconsider the sentence was filed. The State maintained that the requirement of filing a written motion pursuant to Rule 604(d) was jurisdictional and that the juvenile's failure to file a motion required dismissal. The appellate court ruled that failure to file the motion did not require dismissal of the appeal and remanded the case for proceedings pursuant to Rule 604(d). The court affirmed. The failure to file a Rule 604(d) motion did not deprive an appellate court of jurisdiction in either a juvenile or an adult proceeding. But, strict compliance with Rule 604(d) was necessary to preserve issues for appeal. Thus the appellate court properly found it had no discretion and that remand for compliance with the rule was required.</SPAN></P>

Ann. 5/33A-1 (2000). In each case, defendants filed pretrial motions alleging that the &sect; 5/33A-1 sentencing enhancements were unconstitutional. Judges in the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) found that portions of the sentencing enhancements amendment violated the Illinois Constitution. The State appealed, and the cases were consolidated for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged crimes subject to the &quot;15/20/25-to-life&quot; sentence enhancements of &sect; 5/33A-1 (1999 Ill. Laws 404), where possession of a firearm resulted in an additional 15 years, its discharge resulted in an extra 20 years, while discharge resulting in serious injury or death resulted in an enhancement of 25 years to life. The supreme court had ruled that the 15-year enhancement for armed robbery while in possession of a firearm ( 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-2(a)(2), (b) (2000)) violated the Proportionate Penalties Clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and that the attempt statute ( 720 Ill. Comp. Stat.

The supreme court held the definition of &quot;child,&quot; for purposes of the child pornography statute, in 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-20.1(f)(7) (2001), was unconstitutional under this decision, as it attacked the same virtual and pandered child pornography targeted by the unconstitutional federal statutes, but it was severable from the remainder of the child pornography statute, which existed without it, would have been enacted without it, and the legislature preferred to leave the remainder in effect. As 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-20.1(a)(1) and (a)(6) (2001) prohibited, inter alia, making and possessing sexually explicit computer depictions of any actual child under 18, they passed strict scrutiny, so defendant could properly be charged with their violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State said defendant lacked standing to challenge the permissive inference in 625 Ill. Comp. Stat.

The supreme court held the inference applied to special mobile equipment, and defendant was in danger of being subject to the inference and had standing to challenge it. 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-103.2(b) (2000) was not constitutional as to special mobile equipment because it violated due process by removing the requirement that special mobile equipment be recently stolen for its possession to give rise to an inference that the possessor knew it was stolen. By removing the recency requirement of the inference, the legislature weakened the probability that the inference was correct. It could not be decided if the definition of special mobile equipment in 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-191 (2000) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, as there was no fact finding, It was not a case involving first amendment freedoms, so a vagueness challenge could only be resolved by application to the facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his extended sentence should have been reversed because the trial court did not comply with Apprendi in sentencing him. The issue before the supreme court was whether Apprendi applied retroactively to criminal cases in which direct appeals were exhausted before Apprendi was decided. The supreme court concluded that, under the second Teague exception, Apprendi did not apply retroactively to such cases. Defendant also contended that his postconviction counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue of mental fitness to participate in postconviction proceedings. The supreme court found defendant's argument to be without merit. Nothing indicated that defendant did not receive that level of assistance to which he was entitled. All that was required for the postconviction matter was that defendant was able to communicate allegations of constitutional violations to counsel.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, she gave birth to two children, who were taken into State custody shortly after birth and were later adjudicated wards of the court. Applying the amended statute, the trial court found that the mother was unfit as a matter of law. The mother raised constitutional challenges to amended &sect; 50/1(D)(q). During the appeal, the public guardian reported that the children had been adopted by their foster parents because the mother did not seek a stay of the termination order, and the adoption orders had been in place for far more than one year before the appellate court filed its decision. The State argued that the supreme court should not address the merit of the mother's claims because the appeal was moot.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee homeowner filed an action in the circuit court for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant village, after the village denied the homeowner's application for a zoning variance. The parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment. The circuit court permanently enjoined the village from regulating day-care homes under its zoning ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homeowner sought to open a day-care home and obtained a license to do the same from the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), all under the Illinois Child Care Act of 1969, 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 10/1 et seq. (2000). The village determined that the homeowner could not operate a day-care home, as such conduct was barred by one of the village's zoning ordinances. The supreme court found that the appellate court did not err when it determined that the zoning ordinance completely excluded day-care homes from operating anywhere in the village. Because it was a non-home-rule unit, the village could not adopt ordinances under a general grant of power that infringed upon the spirit of state law or were repugnant to the general policy of the state. Therefore, the village was prohibited from regulating day-care homes under its zoning ordinance in a manner that conflicted in any way with the Child Care Act or the DCFS regulations adopted pursuant to that Act. In addition, the homeowner was entitled to operate at day-care home at her residence pursuant to the terms of her DCFS license.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, and the Appellate Court of Illinois reversed his convictions and remanded the case for a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with criminal sexual assault, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat.

Ann. 5/12-16(b) (1998), after his step-children told their mother that defendant had touched their genitals and made them touch his penis. At defendant's trial, the State offered evidence that defendant was convicted of taking indecent liberties with a child when he was 18 years old and the trial court admitted defendant's prior conviction as evidence of his propensity to commit sex offenses. After defendant was convicted of all charges, the trial court used his prior conviction in imposing an enhanced sentence pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-13(b)(4) (1998). The state supreme court held that (1) the trial court properly admitted defendant's prior conviction under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff tobacco corporation challenged the constitutionality of the Tobacco Products Tax Act of 1995, 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 143/10-10 et seq. (West 2000). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) and the Court of Appeals upheld the Act against challenges under the Illinois Due Process Clause and the Uniformity Clause. Summary judgment was granted to defendants, the director of revenue and others. Leave to appeal was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation argued that the tax imposed by the Act was arbitrary and unreasonable because it selectively targeted for taxation distributors of cigars and chewing tobacco to fund a general welfare program of the state, designed to benefit a broad range of taxpayers. The state's highest court held that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendants on the due process claim. The corporation presented no compelling reason for construing the Illinois Due Process Clause independently of its federal counterpart. Further, the tax imposed under the Act bore a reasonable relationship to the objective of the Act and it did not violate the Uniformity Clause. As defendants asserted a justification for the tax, that the Act taxed tobacco distributors because their products caused diseases that conceivably required long-term care for those persons who could not pay for it, it was then the corporation's burden to come forward with evidence showing that the asserted justification was unsupported by the facts, which the corporation failed to do.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child's parents hired the lay midwife to give them advice and assist them in a home delivery. The mother had several prenatal visits. While the midwife was assisting with the delivery, the baby was born in a breech position. The midwife waited before calling paramedics. The baby died. The supreme court held the Director proffered no testimony that a videotape that was actually admitted into evidence was a true and accurate depiction of what it purported to show. Thus, the trial court erred in admitting the videotape. However, the conduct of the midwife during the birth constituted prima facie evidence of &quot;professional nursing&quot; within the meaning of the Act. Throughout her interaction with the parents the midwife was assessing the &quot;healthcare needs&quot; of both the mother and the baby, and making &quot;nursing evaluations&quot; in violation of 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 65/5-10(l) (West 2000). The provisions of the Act were not unconstitutionally vague as applied to her. Her argument regarding separation of powers was also without merit.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 3205/3 (West 2000) violated Ill. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(a), art. IV, &sect; 8(d). The Illinois trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court had to defer to the legislative findings in the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority Act, 70 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 3205/1 et seq. (West 2000), as amended by 1999 Ill. Laws 935, unless there was a threshold showing that the findings were evasive and that the Act's purpose was principally to benefit private interests. In view of the stadium's long history of hosting events that had incidentally benefitted private interests, the court could discern no evasive or deceptive purpose in the legislative findings. Because an adjacent park was not dedicated to a particular use or purpose, the legislature could determine its use. The park and the stadium were public facilities already owned and operated by the park district. No private property interests were at issue. There was no abdication of control of the property to the football club. The public would enjoy a fully renovated, multi-use stadium, instead of a deteriorating 78-year-old facility. Those results did not violate the public trust doctrine even though the club would also benefit. Because 1999 Ill. Laws 935 was certified, under the enrolled-bill doctrine, judicial review under Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d) was precluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After admitting to two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault, defendant 12-year-old appealed the Illinois appellate court's affirming of probation requirements that he register under the Sex Offender Registration Act, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/1 et seq. (West 2000), for the rest of his life, arguing substantive due process, double jeopardy, and cruel and unusual punishment, and challenged being banished from his home town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because defendant challenged the constitutionality of the probation conditions, a failure to comply with Ill Sup. Ct. R. 604(d) did not bar the appeal. Under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/2(A-5) (West 2000), defendant was a juvenile sex offender due to the aggravated criminal sexual assault adjudication, and qualified as a sexual predator under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/2(E)(1) (West 2000). The Act was not punitive and therefore did not violate the Eighth Amendment, because the dissemination of information under the Act was restricted as to juveniles; the double jeopardy argument likewise failed.  705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/5-715(2)(r) (West 2000) allowed restricting a minor defendant's ability to be in a designated area as a condition of probation, if the court included terms for entering the area for legitimate purposes. Due to the nature of the offenses and hostile public sentiment, removing defendant from the location where the offenses took place was in his best interest, and was a benefit to his and his victims' rehabilitation. But, the trial court had not determined what appropriate terms for entering the geographic area should be applied and thus was overly broad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the appellate court, affirming the judgment of the trial court, was affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. That portion of the trial court's order imposing the banishment condition was vacated, and upon remand, the court could consider whether the geographic travel restriction was still warranted and, if so, what appropriate terms for entering the geographic area would be applied.</SPAN></P>

The mother claimed that the brothers encouraged her daughter to drink, that they assumed a duty of caring for her daughter after she became unconscious, and that her daughter died because the brothers acted negligently. The state supreme court held that (1) Illinois did not recognize a common law cause of action for injuries arising out of the sale or gift of alcohol and the trial court ruled correctly that the father could not be held liable under the common law or under Illinois' Dramshop Act, 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-21 (West 2000), because the brothers provided the daughter with alcohol while she was at the father's home; but (2) the mother's complaint stated a cause of action against the brothers for negligence based on breach of a voluntary undertaking to care for her daughter, and the appellate court properly reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing that claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury sitting in the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County (Illinois), found defendant guilty of simple involuntary manslaughter, and the trial court imposed an enhanced sentence of eight years in prison. On appeal, the Appellate Court of Illinois vacated defendant's sentence and ordered the trial court to impose a sentence no longer than five years. The state supreme court granted the State's petition for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter of a family or household member, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3(f) (West 1998), after she admitted placing her hand over the mouth of an infant when he would not stop crying, and a forensic pathologist opined that the child died from asphyxiation. Defendant lived in the same household as the child's mother and defendant and the child's mother shared responsibility for taking care of each other's children. At the end of defendant's trial, the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of involuntary manslaughter, but did not ask the jury to find that the victim was a member of defendant's family or household. After the jury found defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter, the trial court determined that defendant was eligible for an enhanced sentence because the victim was a member of defendant's household and was also a person of tender years, and it imposed an enhanced sentence. The state supreme court held that the trial court violated the United States Supreme Court's Apprendi decision by not submitting the question of the victim's status to the jury, but the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state supreme court affirmed the intermediate appellate court's judgment that defendant's sentence was imposed in violation of the United States Supreme Court's Apprendi decision, but because the error was harmless, the supreme court reversed the intermediate appellate court's judgment vacating defendant's sentence, and it affirmed the eight-year sentence imposed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Illinois sought review from an order of the appellate court (Illinois), which reversed defendant's conviction for reckless homicide and remanded the matter for a new trial, based on a finding that &sect; 9-3(b) of the Criminal Code of 1961, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3(b) (West 2000), created an unconstitutional mandatory presumption of recklessness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of reckless homicide, which occurred when the car he was driving crossed the median and struck an oncoming car, killing a person therein. The evidence showed that defendant knew his car brakes were not working properly and that defendant was intoxicated. Defendant objected to the trial court's jury instruction that was based on &sect; 9-3(b), but the trial court overruled his objection and he was convicted. On appeal, the appellate court found that &sect; 9-3(b) created a mandatory presumption that violated defendant's due process rights in that the presumption shifted the burden to defendant to show that he was not acting recklessly. On appeal, the court agreed with the appellate court. The court found that the presumption was not a permissive one because upon a finding that defendant was intoxicated, the jury was to presume that he was reckless unless he proved that he was not. This burden-shifting was unconstitutional. However, the court found that &sect; 9-3(b) was severable from the remainder of the statute. The court noted that the jury instruction was not a harmless error because the result might have been different without it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) effectively dismissed the charge of attempted first degree murder against defendant by ruling that the attempt statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/8-4 (West 2000), amended by 1991 Ill. Laws 404, &sect; 5 (effective January 1, 2000), (amended statute) was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court found the amended statute was unconstitutional since the &quot;15-20-25 to life&quot;-mandated penalties for attempted first degree murder (the attempt) violated the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970) as it permitted a person who failed to kill the victim and was convicted of the attempt to be sentenced to a much greater term than the person who actually killed his victim. The amended statute provided that a person who intended to kill but failed to kill was to be convicted of the attempt, whether or not mitigating circumstances existed, and was to be sentenced to six to 30 years, with the mandatory addition of 15, 20, or 25 years to life, depending on whether a firearm was in the person's possession, discharged, or the cause of bodily harm or the death of another. A person who intended to kill and killed, whether or not a firearm was used, was to be subject to a lesser 730 Ill. Comp.

Defendant remained seized, unreasonably, after officers saw the container was never opened, within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and Ill. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner pled guilty to a murder and two aggravated criminal sexual assaults. He was sentenced to death. His convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. He then petitioned under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 et seq.

It also found a manifest error standard applied where specific factual circumstances had to be examined. It first applied the manifest error standard to find no error occurred in finding he was fit to plead guilty and that his trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance. It then applied the de novo standard to find meritless his claims that appointed public defenders had an inherent conflict of interest, that his attorneys were ineffective for not arguing that similarly-situated defendants received lesser sentences, and that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the State's petition for leave to appeal from an order of the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, Third Division, which reversed a circuit court's denial of defendant's second motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence and remanded for further proceedings. Defendant was convicted of three counts of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and was sentenced to concurrent terms of 15 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State acknowledged that police made an extraterritorial arrest pursuant to an amendment to Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/7-4-8, which was later held to be unconstitutional. The state argued that, as of the date of defendant's arrest, the amendment to &sect; 5/7-4-8 had not been declared unconstitutional. Thus, the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied because police did not violate defendant's substantive constitutional rights in effecting the arrest. The court acknowledged that the exclusionary rule applied where police made an extraterritorial arrest without appropriate statutory authority. However, applying the good-faith exception after 1989 Ill. Laws 404 was declared facially unconstitutional, ran counter to the court's single subject clause and void ab initio jurisprudence. Giving effect to the historical fact that the amendment existed at the time of defendant's arrest effectively resurrected the amendment and provided a grace period during which Illinois citizens were subjected to extraterritorial arrests without proper authorization. The court concluded that police effectuated an unlawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

At trial, the State presented evidence that the woman's husband had hired defendant and another man to kill her. Defendant was convicted. He was sentenced to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal to the state supreme court. During post-conviction proceedings, defendant filed a pro se motion for mitochondrial DNA testing pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/116-3 (West 2000). Defendant's motion requested DNA testing of hair evidence in an attempt to prove his actual innocence because hairs and other materials were observed on the victim's clothes and car. The trial court initially denied defendant's motion. However, it granted his motion to reconsider and entered an order allowing mitochondrial DNA analysis of hairs on the victim's gloves. The State appealed. After considering that appeal, the state supreme court found that the State's appeal had to be dismissed. It so concluded because it found that although the granting of the motion could be characterized as a final judgment, the State had not shown any authority for its proposition that it had the right to appeal the granting of the motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question before the supreme court was whether 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-16(c) (West 2000) was unconstitutionally vague. The supreme court stated that in determining whether &sect;6-16(c) was unconstitutionally vague, the proper inquiry was whether the statute gave fair warning as to what conduct was required of an occupant to prevent an intoxicated minor from departing. In upholding the determination that the statute was unconstitutional, the supreme court noted that &sect; 6-16(c) provided no guidance as to the steps that were to be taken to prevent an intoxicated minor from leaving a gathering. In addition, the supreme court noted that a residential occupant who physically detained an intoxicated minor could be criminally culpable for unlawful restraint. Thus posing a difficult choice for the occupant: either comply with the statute and commit a felony, or do nothing and commit a misdemeanor. The supreme court held that &sect; 6-16(c) failed to provide the kind of notice that would enable an ordinary person to understand what they must do to avoid prosecution under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a 15-year-old juvenile, was convicted of 2 counts of first-degree murder based upon accountability. The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) declined to impose the statutorily mandated sentence, holding that application of the statute to defendant would offend the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Instead, the trial court sentenced defendant to 50 years in prison. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was told to be a lookout. Two other individuals then shot two victims. Under the automatic transfer statute, defendant was considered to be an adult for purposes of trial. Under the accountability statute, he was considered equal to the actual shooter. Thus, he was tried as if he were the adult shooter. Under the sentencing statute, he was then subject to the most severe punishment. The trial court ruled that application of the multiple-murder sentencing statute,&nbsp;730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) was highly unconscionable. The supreme court held its holding in Truitt with respect to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 603 and the State's ability to directly appeal a circuit court's finding of unconstitutionality was overly broad. It noted that, when the three statutes that were applied converged, a court never considered the actual facts of the crime. Thus, it held the penalty mandated by 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii), as applied to defendant, was particularly harsh and unconstitutionally disproportionate. A mandatory sentence of natural life in prison with no possibility of parole shocked the moral sense of the community and violated Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

It then imposed an extended-term sentence of 80 years in prison based on that finding and pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-2(a) (West 1998). The appellate court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the extended-term sentence upon finding 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-2 to be facially unconstitutional. After defendant appealed, the state supreme court found that the sentence could not stand because it violated Apprendi. It so concluded because it found defendant's sentence could not exceed the 60-year basic first-degree murder sentence based on a factual finding made by the trial court. However, it also found that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-2 was not facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court's judgment that the sentence could not stand was affirmed. However, its conclusion that the sentencing statute was facially unconstitutional was vacated. The conviction entered by the trial court was affirmed, but the sentence was vacated and the case was remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois), upon remand, in defendant's second post-conviction petition, held a hearing with respect to the proportionality of defendant's death sentence as compared to the sentences given to three of his co-participants in the murder of three rival gang members, and rejected his petition. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was an active and willing participant in all three killings; he beat one victim, took part in setting up the murders, encouraged the use of a knife instead of a gun, guarded and escorted two victims to their deaths, and knifed the last victim to death. One other co-participant testified for the State and received a 40-year sentence, a second received the death sentence, and the third received 3 consecutive life sentences. Defendant argued primarily that his sentence was disproportionate to the third co-participant. The State was estopped from arguing that defendant's culpability, or rehabilitation potential, was worse than the third co-participant's since it had previously argued the third co-participant's was worse. With respect to the comparative proportionality review for actors in the same crime, the high court analyzed, de novo, the rehabilitative potential, criminal history, and relative culpability factors, to conclude defendant was no less culpable than the third co-participant. Defendant's sentence was not arbitrarily or unreasonably disparate; the two separate juries could reasonably reach different conclusions about the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted in the circuit court of Winnebago County (Illinois) on four counts of first degree murder under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(19) (West 2000). On appeal following bail denial, the appellate court declared 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/110-4(b) (West 2000) unconstitutional and remanded the case to the trial court to consider defendant's bail request. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had requested bail and sought a determination that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/110-4(b) (West 2000) was unconstitutional. This court agreed with the lower court finding that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/110-4(b) (West 2000) was unconstitutional and that defendant's pretrial bail proceedings deprived him of his constitutional right to due process, but the unconstitutionality of &sect; 110-4(b) was not fatal to the remainder of &sect; 110-4. As Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 expressly protected the right of a defendant to bail unless certain circumstances existed, the prosecution had to have the burden of showing sufficient evidence that a defendant should be denied that constitutional right. As a practical matter, the State was in a better position to present such evidence during a bail hearing. The accused was often in a very poor position to present evidence, being incarcerated and facing fresh criminal charges. Placing the burden on the accused was forcing him to prove a negative. This holding did not serve to invalidate the entire statute. The removal of &sect; 110-4(b) did not undermine the completeness of, nor the ability to execute, the remaining subsections of &sect; 110-4.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In terminating the mother's parental rights, the trial court found that she was unfit based on the allegations of substantial neglect, neglect or other misconduct, failure to correct the conditions that were the basis for removal, and failure to make reasonable progress toward the return of the children. The appellate court reversed the trial court's decision on the first two allegations on the basis that the applicable statute was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court vacated as to the last two allegations on the basis that the trial court considered evidence occurring outside the applicable time periods. On appeal, the supreme court found that the appellate court's unduly restrictive definition of &quot;substantial neglect&quot; was in error. The supreme court concluded that the trial court's determination of substantial and continuous neglect was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or not based on the evidence presented. As for the mother's attempt to obtain a substitution of judge for cause, the supreme court affirmed the trial court's denial of such motion, finding that the judge's comments, while critical of the mother's credibility, did not demonstrate a bias against the mother.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that &sect; 2-28(3) encroached upon the inherent powers of the judiciary. The supreme court agreed. Despite the language in 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/2-28(2) (1998), a permanency order was not final. Thus, it was not appealable under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 304(b)(1). The legislature's attempt to make a nonfinal judgment appealable violated Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs argued that they had standing to bring a taxpayer action against defendants on behalf of the State. The supreme court held that it was the State that was actually and substantially interested in the action, and only the Sate could be entitled to the benefits of a successful action.

Plaintiffs further argued that they had standing to sue on behalf of the State under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/20-104(b) (West 1998). The supreme court held that the legislature had improperly reduced the attorney general's common law authority by enacting the statute to confer standing upon private citizens to commence and prosecute actions on behalf of the State. Since the statute usurped the powers of the attorney general, it was invalid. The supreme court determined that the statute was unconstitutional to the extent that it purported to confer standing on private citizens to sue in cases where the State was the real party in interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants in these three consolidated cases were convicted of unrelated crimes. Their convictions were affirmed on direct review. Defendants filed petitions for post-conviction relief. The trial court summarily dismissed each petition, and defendants appealed. The Fourth District (Illinois) affirmed one dismissal, and the Fifth District (Illinois) reversed the other dismissals. The state supreme court granted leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that the trial courts erred in summarily dismissing their post-conviction petitions as untimely during stage one of the post-conviction proceeding process and other errors. The appellate court held that the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act did not authorize the dismissal of a post-conviction petition during the initial stage based on untimeliness. Under a plain reading of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 122-2.1(a)(2) (West 2000), the circuit court could dismiss a post-conviction petition at the initial stage only if the petition was deemed to be frivolous or patently without merit. Further, time was not an inherent element of the right to bring a post-conviction petition. For that reason, the appellate court held that time limitations in the Post-Conviction Hearing Act should be considered as an affirmative defense and could be raised, waived, or forfeited by the State. Further, a defendant's claim of actual innocence could not be reviewed when a circuit court entered a summary dismissal sua sponte. The state supreme court held the statute was not void for vagueness, and that an amendment to the Act did not violate Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d) (1970).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment, which affirmed the denial of one of defendant's petitions, was reversed and remanded, and the other judgments were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court issued a summary judgment order terminating appellee mother's parental rights over her three children. The Illinois appellate court reversed and remanded the case.

The appellate court denied the motion, and the guardian and appellant State of Illinois sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court terminated the mother's and father's parental rights and appointed a guardian with the power to consent to adoption. After the mother filed a notice of appeal, but before the intermediate appellate court ruled, the children were adopted. The intermediate appellate court, unaware of the adoption, reversed on the basis that unresolved fact questions made summary judgment improper. The mother had not requested a stay to prevent enforcement of the termination order, but argued that a stay was unnecessary because she had filed a notice of appeal. The supreme court disagreed, ruling that the filing of a notice of appeal did not serve as a stay of the termination order. The mother's failure to stay the termination order allowed the adoption to proceed legally. The 12-month time limitation to challenge the adoptions (found at 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/20b (West 1998)) passed and the adoptions were never challenged. Therefore, the termination issue was moot as to the mother's parental rights over these children. Once it learned of the adoption, the intermediate appellate court should have dismissed the appeal as moot.</SPAN></P>

The driver was an employee of the employer, who had a vehicle detailing and cleaning business.

After regular business hours, the driver returned to the shop and, without authority, took the car for his own use. The driver was intoxicated when he struck the son's vehicle. The parents alleged negligent entrustment against the car owner. The parents failed to establish the elements of negligent entrustment. There was no reason that the car owner knew or should have known that the driver was unlicensed or incompetent. Evidence that the car owner knew of six or seven detours that workers for the employer had taken over several years fell short of establishing the evidence necessary under this element. The car owner did not give express or implied permission to the driver to drive the vehicle at the time of the accident.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant murdered an acquaintance in order to get money to buy drugs. The primary evidence used by the State against defendant came from his own admissions to his family, friends, and to police. The appellate court held that prior to or at the time of defendant's videotaped crime scene statement, there was not such a constitutionally significant degree of prosecutorial involvement as to trigger defendant's U.S. Const. amend. VI right to counsel. The investigators did not violate defendant's U.S. Const. amend. VI right to counsel by failing to cease their ongoing investigation. Defendant's statements to the police were voluntary. There were no sufficient mitigating factors to preclude the imposition of the death penalty. The trial court considered and weighed all the evidence presented before it. In addition, the evidence presented in aggravation and mitigation was not closely balanced. A detailed account regarding defendant's attack on another victim was irrelevant victim impact testimony. However, it did not so prejudice defendant. The Illinois death penalty statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

He decided to waive his right to a jury trial. The trial court, speaking to defendant across the closed circuit system, admonished defendant regarding his right to a jury trial. Finding that defendant understood his right to trial by jury and was voluntarily giving it up, the trial court accepted his jury waiver. When defendant wanted to speak to his attorney privately, his counsel left the courtroom and contacted defendant by telephone. Defendant was convicted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's post-conviction petition raised eight grounds for relief. The appellate court held, inter alia, that defendant did not show that there was a bona fide doubt concerning his fitness to stand trial. Information as to the polysubstance abuse of a State witness, and his statement about gang foes was not material under Brady. Aggravation testimony of a corrections officer, which defendant failed to show was perjured, did not result in a Brady violation. The appellate court ordered an evidentiary hearing as to defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing where counsel signed an affidavit stating that he failed to investigate and present evidence in mitigation because he did not believe defendant would be sentenced to death. Defendant's request for a new sentencing hearing was denied. The failure of defendant's appellate counsel to raise an argument based on the amendment of the armed robbery statute did not constitute ineffective assistance since defendant was indicted prior to the amendment. Defendant's argument that Illinois' death penalty statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1 (West 1998), was unconstitutional based on Apprendi was rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of De Kalb County (Illinois), the trial court sentenced defendant to 75 years' imprisonment for first degree murder involving the death of a 70-year old victim and a concurrent 20-year sentence for armed robbery and home invasion. The Appellate Court of Illinois, Second District, vacated the sentence for first degree murder and the state supreme court granted the State's petition for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, armed robbery, aggravated battery, and home invasion after a 70-year old man died from stab wounds to the chest and neck. The trial court found that the victim was 60 years old or older at the time of the offense, was handicapped, and that the offense was accompanied by exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty, and it sentenced defendant to 75 years in prison for the murder, pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-2(a)(1) (1994). The intermediate appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction but reversed his extended-term sentence for murder. The state supreme court held that (1) the trial court could impose an extended-term sentence if only one of the factors listed in 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3.2(b) (1994) was proved beyond a reasonable doubt and because the victim's age was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial court did not have to find that the victim was handicapped or that the offense was exceptionally brutal or heinous beyond a reasonable doubt before it imposed an extended-term sentence; and (2) the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state supreme court affirmed that part of the intermediate appellate court's judgment that affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for armed robbery and home invasion, but reversed that of the intermediate appellate court's judgment that reversed the defendant's sentence for first degree murder, and affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with home invasion while armed with a firearm in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-11(a)(3) (Supp. 1999), as amended. He moved to dismiss on grounds that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-11 violated the state constitution's separation of powers clause (Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1), and the proportionate penalties clause (Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11). The Illinois circuit court agreed, and dismissed the charges. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The home invasion statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-11(a)(3) ( Supp. 1999), as amended by 2000 Ill. Laws 91-404, &sect; 5, carried a mandatory add-on sentence where a defendant armed with a firearm used or threatened the use of force upon anyone in the invaded home, whether or not injury occurred. The circuit court held that &sect; 12-11(a)(3), by imposing mandatory add-on sentences, violated the separation of powers clause. The supreme court disagreed. First, trial courts retained the ability under &sect; 12-11(a)(3) to consider aggravating and mitigating factors. Second, aggravating and mitigating factors did not have to be a part of the sentencing equation if the legislature deemed such factors inappropriate. The 15/20/25-life enhancement penalty applied when the offender possessed a firearm, discharged a firearm and/or injured an occupant of the dwelling. The supreme court held that the sentencing range was not so severe as to render the statute unconstitutional as violative of the proportionality clause. A 21-to-45-year sentence for violating &sect; 12-11(a)(3) (Supp. 1999) was not cruel or degrading, nor did it shock the moral conscience.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that the trial court erred by invalidating portions of the Act on its face on vagueness grounds where plaintiffs did not allege a first amendment interest at stake in the Act, and plaintiffs lacked standing to raise arguments regarding alleged encroachments upon the powers of the executive and judicial branches of government because neither plaintiff was an official of the executive or judicial branch of government. The supreme court held that plaintiffs lacked standing to advance any of the claims they raised in the circuit court. The supreme court noted that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that there was a concrete dispute. Thus, plaintiffs' challenge requested the court to issue an advisory opinion, which the court could not do. Thus, the supreme court held that the trial court erred by declaring the Act unconstitutional, and the complaint should have been dismissed in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner pled guilty to attempted murder, rape, and armed robbery, and received extended-term sentences upon the trial court's finding of exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty, as permitted by the sentencing statute in effect at the time. Two decades later he sought habeas corpus relief, arguing that without a jury finding on the issue of special circumstances, his extended-term sentences violated the rule of Apprendi. The high court held that the trial court erred in granting relief. The statutes in question, codified at the time of the petition at 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-3.2, 5-8-2, had already been held not unconstitutional on their faces. If petitioner had not pled guilty, he might have succeeded on a challenge to the constitutionality of the statute as applied to him under Apprendi, but by pleading guilty, he waived his right to a jury trial and to a jury's finding of all elements contributing to his sentence beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, his guilty plea had been upheld on direct appeal and on an earlier petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with offenses including armed robbery while in possession of a firearm. Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion arguing that the 15-year sentencing enhancement in 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/18-2(b) violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970). The Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) invalidated the 15-year enhancement. The State immediately appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A statute was presumed constitutional, and the party challenging the statute bore the burden of demonstrating its invalidity. The court had a duty to construe a statute in a manner that upheld its validity and constitutionality if it reasonably could be done. Whether a statute was constitutional was a question of law that was reviewed de novo. The appellate court held the appeal was controlled by the decision in People v. Walden, which concluded that the 15-year sentencing enhancement for armed robbery while in possession of a firearm in 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/18-2(b) violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution and therefore was unenforceable. Given the identity of issue between this appeal and Walden, the appellate court held that the trial court's order invalidating the 15-year enhancement was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant allegedly committed an armed robbery while possessing a firearm. Prior to trial, he argued the 15-year sentencing enhancement for committing an armed robbery while in possession of a firearm, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/18-2(b) (2000), violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution. The trial court agreed and invalidated that provision. The State immediately appealed after it construed that ruling as an effective dismissal of the part of its indictment that charged him with armed robbery while in possession of a firearm. On a cross-appeal, defendant sought dismissal of other charges lodged against him on the grounds that the delay caused by the State's appeal denied him his speedy-trial rights pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/103-5 (2000). After the appellate court considered the arguments of the parties, it found that the 15-year sentencing enhancement was in violation of the proportionate penalties clause found in Ill. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court affirming a trial court judgment convicting her on guilty plea of aggravated battery and imposing an extended term sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When defendant agreed to plead guilty to aggravated battery, the State agreed not to seek an extended term sentence, despite the fact that defendant's slashing attack on a romantic rival was very violent. At plea entry, the trial court warned defendant that an extended term sentence was still possible, depending on the facts ultimately found by the court, and in the end, the trial court found that the attack was accompanied by exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty, justifying an extended term sentence under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(2). The high court held, first, that the issue was not mooted by defendant's parole, because the length of the original sentence would affect the time she would serve if re-incarceration became necessary. It then noted that it had already held that Illinois sentencing statutes were not unconstitutional on their face, and that the statute was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant because by pleading guilty, she waived the right to have a jury decide on her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on every element of the offense, the right protected by the Apprendi rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Will County Circuit Court, Illinois, entered a judgment that dismissed defendant's first amended postconviction petition without an evidentiary hearing in a case where defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, deviate sexual assault, rape, and attempted murder, and his convictions and resulting sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A man and woman stopped their vehicle on the side of a highway to sleep. The woman awoke, then watched as the man was shot to death. The assailant drove away in his truck with her, sexually assaulted her, then stopped and raped her. The assailant later dumped her from the truck. Defendant was identified as a suspect several months later. He retained a trial attorney. The trial attorney obtained continuances. However, defendant's trial attorney was involved in an ongoing bribery scandal. He did little to prepare defendant's case. Defendant's convictions on multiple charges were affirmed on direct appeal. He then filed a postconviction relief petition. The trial court dismissed it without holding an evidentiary hearing. In so doing, it refused to consider whether DNA testing should be conducted, whether defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel, and whether retained counsel should have given an evidence deposition. After the petition was denied, the state supreme court found the trial court erred in not allowing DNA testing, a hearing should have been ordered on the alleged ineffectiveness, and trial counsel should have been ordered to give an evidence deposition.</SPAN></P>

Denial of the other claims was affirmed and the case was ordered to be remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to murder and received a sentence of 60 years' imprisonment. The Court of Appeals (Illinois) declined to vacate the guilty plea and sentence or allow defendant leave to file a motion to withdraw his plea. On remand, defendant's motion to reconsider sentence was denied. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant's petition for leave to appeal was granted, pursuant to 177 Ill. 2d R. 315(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state's highest court held that defendant should have been given an opportunity to file the motion to vacate his guilty plea under the unusual circumstances of the case. The court-appointed psychiatrist opined, prior to trial, that defendant was sane at the time of the murder, under the insanity definition in Ill. Pub. Act 89-404 (1989). Based upon that representation, defendant pled guilty to the murder. However, the insanity provisions used at trial were enacted in contravention of the single subject rule, and were thus, unconstitutional. Had the fact been known to defendant at that time, his decision to forgo the affirmative defense and to enter a guilty plea might have been different. In fact, the psychiatrist testified that under the former version of the insanity statute, he would have concluded that defendant was insane at the time of the murder, as defendant was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. The trial court relied upon that representation in accepting defendant's guilty plea. Thus, all parties involved may have been operating under a misapprehension of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Illinois appellate court reversed a trial court's judgment that found appellant government agency properly exercised its power of eminent domain in taking property owned by appellee property owners and conveying it to a third party. The government agency filed a petition for leave to appeal, which the state supreme court granted. After reversing the appellate court's decision, the state supreme court granted a petition for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Illinois General Assembly created the government agency to promote recreational activities and facilities to reduce unemployment and enhance the state's general welfare. To achieve those purposes, the legislature empowered the government agency to issue bonds to develop or improve projects. The government agency then issued the bonds. It lent the proceeds to a third party to develop a multipurpose automotive sports and training facility. Since that project was very successful, the third party found it needed to expand, and needed additional parking. The third party persuaded the government agency to have the property owners' property condemned so the third party could obtain it to increase its parking, even though the third party could have built a parking facility on its existing land. After the trial court ordered that title to the property be vested in the government agency and the appellate court affirmed, the state supreme court found that the government agency's taking of the property was unconstitutional as the taking was to benefit a private party in helping it to solve its parking problems and was not primarily for a public use or public purpose.</SPAN></P>

Appellee employer appealed. Appellee industrial commission (IC) decreased the weeks of TTD and vacated the rest of the award. A circuit court confirmed the IC's decision.

The claimant argued to the appellate court and later to the state supreme court that the IC's decision was void because the deciding panel was illegally constituted. The appellate court rejected that argument, but the state supreme court agreed with the claimant. Pursuant to &sect; 13 of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act, 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. 305/13, the governor had authority to appoint commissioners to the IC with the senate's consent and authority to temporarily appoint replacement commissioners to fill vacancies while the senate was in recess. One exception allowed the commission chairman to make appointments, but it did not apply. Since the commission chairman lacked statutory authority to appoint the commissioners who finally decided the case, the appointments had no legal effect and the IC's decision was void. The case had to be remanded to the IC for a decision by a legally constituted panel.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/18-1.1 (2000). Appellee, the decedent's daughter and the administrator of his estate, opposed the claim on grounds that &sect; 18-1.1 was unconstitutional. The Cook County, Illinois, Circuit Court, agreed with the daughter, and dismissed the sister's custodial claim. The sister appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sister lived with and cared for the decedent from 1987 to his death in 1999. Under &sect; 18-1.1, a spouse, parent, sibling, or child was entitled to a fixed compensation for living with and caring for a disabled decedent for at least three years. The trial court held that &sect; 18-1.1 violated the special legislation, equal protection, due process, and separation of powers provisions of the Illinois Constitution. The supreme court disagreed. The classification of close family members who alone were eligible for compensation bore a rational relationship to the purpose of the statute, and was not arbitrary. Thus, neither the special legislation nor the equal protection clauses, Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13, and art. I, &sect;2, respectively, were violated. There was no due process violation: the minimum claim amounts were not arbitrary, and the statute remedied the inequity of allowing heirs who never cared for a decedent to recover more from his estate than one who dedicated years of her life to him. The statute was not too vague to be applied. Finally, by setting minimum claim amounts, the legislature did not violate the separation of powers provision of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

On direct appeal, the Supreme Court of Illinois remanded for resentencing as the circuit court failed to fully consider the mitigating factor of defendant's good prison behavior. Defendant again waived his right to a jury for the second phase of the sentencing hearing and a Circuit Court of Henry County (Illinois) judgment imposed the death penalty. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court held a new sentencing hearing upon remand. The supreme court summarized evidence in that hearing and decided that the circuit court adequately expressed its reasoning for weighing aggravators and mitigators and finding defendant eligible for and imposing the death sentence. The circuit court admitted and analyzed the testimony of four admitted prostitutes, rendered credible because they corresponded to each other; an officer's testimony; and physical evidence of defendant's brutal sexual attacks on the prostitutes in his car in secluded areas. They lived to testify; the victim did not. The fact that defendant was not charged for the conduct against the women did not mean their testimony could not be used to minimize the weight of defendant's 72 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(c) mitigator: that he had no significant history of prior criminal activity (and not as an &quot;other reasons&quot; aggravator). Counsel's trial strategy to allow admission of the officer's testimony to show the women's testimony inconsistencies was not ineffective assistance.

Stat. 5/13-214.3(d) indicated that the exception to the six year statute of repose for attorney malpractice actions applied to her claim because the section did not draw a distinction between probate and nonprobate distributions. The supreme court held that the language of 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-214.3(d) unambiguously supported its application to all cases when the alleged injury caused by the attorney's act or omission did not occur until the death of the person for whom the professional services were rendered. The court noted that there was no language limiting such actions to those that involve assets distributed through probate proceedings or excluding actions that involve nonprobate distributions of assets. Thus, the manner of distributing the decedent's assets was of no consequence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the petitions. The indigent mother appealed. The appellate court appointed counsel for her. That counsel soon requested payment. The appellate court ordered the county to pay the attorney. After the county appealed, the state supreme court held equal protection grounds dictated the indigent mother was entitled to the same procedural safeguards under the Adoption Act, including counsel, as a similarly situated parent had in a Juvenile Court Act proceeding as the adoption involved state action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the federal census, the commission held a series of meeting and public hearings to create a redistricting plan.

Overall, the level of compactness had changed little from the prior plan. The commission rigorously adhered to the equality of population requirement. Its plan provided adequate representation to minorities and other special interests and conformed to legal requirements regarding political fairness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Summary partial dismissals made during the first stage of a post-conviction proceeding were not permitted under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act (the Act), 725 Ill.

The appellate court erred in finding that the error in permitting a partial dismissal was so fundamental that the entire process needed to be started anew and not reaching any of the remaining issues of defendant's post-conviction appeal. It was difficult to perceive how further proceedings could benefit anyone, as defendant was given the opportunity to consult with appointed counsel, to discuss the claims that had been improperly dismissed, and to re-allege them if he so desired.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that because the act regulated speech, it had to meet a heightened standard of precision. The supreme court found that the act's registration provisions applied to all entities that solicited funds for purposes defined in the act, and did not in any way control the content of speech. Therefore, the registration and reporting requirements were content neutral, and the law was subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny. The supreme court concluded that the registration and reporting requirements of the act served a substantial governmental interest. As to whether the challenged provisions of the act were narrowly tailored to serve this interest, the supreme court held that although the terms at issue were broad in scope, the court failed to see how they could be more precisely defined. The terms defendants challenged had well-settled definitions in Illinois. The supreme court concluded that the act's registration and reporting requirements were narrowly tailored to serve the state's substantial governmental interest in protecting its citizens from fraud and did not unnecessarily burden First Amendment speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In plaintiff patient's medical malpractice suit against defendants, hospital, corporations, and physicians, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, declared that parts of 210 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The challenged parts of the HLA allowed ex parte communications regarding patient records between certain non-party health care providers with counsel and hospital staff who were parties and gave immunity for HLA violations under some circumstances. The circuit court found that (1) parts of 210 Ill. Comp. Stat. 85/6.17(d), (e), and all of 210 Ill. Comp. Stat. 85/6.17(h) violated the separation of powers doctrine; (2) 210 Ill. Comp.

The appealing defendants and amici argued that the circuit court's decision ignored the compelling health-care policy concerns that supported the challenged provisions. The state supreme court held that 210 Ill. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), defendant was convicted on two counts of first degree murder for the deaths of his ex-girlfriend and her 11-year-old daughter. Defendant was sentenced to death after the jury found him eligible for the death penalty and found no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude its imposition. Defendant appealed his convictions and death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was incarcerated while awaiting trial as a result of sexually assaulting his girlfriend's daughter. From prison he instructed some of his family members to &quot;get rid of&quot; the victims. The family members stabbed the victims to death. They subsequently testified against defendant in exchange for receiving life sentences. At the sentencing hearing, considerable evidence of defendant's past violence and numerous rapes of his sisters, along with others, was presented. Defendant acknowledged that the testimony pertaining to the alleged sexual assault was admissible to establish his motive. The appellate court held the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by its prejudice. After a review of the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the appellate court concluded that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was accountable for the murders. Defendant's other alleged evidentiary errors were waived. His sentence of death was not disproportionate to that of his family members who pled guilty and offered testimony, nor was it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(a)(1), and the trial court imposed an extended-term sentence of 100 years. Defendant appealed, and the Appellate Court (Illinois) affirmed. Defendant filed a petition for rehearing, which the appellate court denied. Defendant filed a motion for leave to file a late petition for leave to appeal, and the state supreme court granted the motion and the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant confessed to the murder. The victim was tortured prior to the murder because it was believed that the victim was involved in the murder of a friend of defendant. The State sought the death penalty, and the trial court found defendant was eligible for the death penalty. The trial court declined to impose the death penalty based on defendant's youth and cooperation. Defendant argued that his 100 year extended-term sentence violated the Apprendi doctrine. Under Apprendi, any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum was required to be submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court held that the sentence imposed did not violate Apprendi. Based exclusively upon facts that were proved beyond a reasonable doubt, defendant faced a prescribed statutory maximum sentence of death. The sentence actually imposed did not exceed this maximum. The appellate court held that when a defendant was found eligible for the death penalty by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the imposition of an extended-term prison sentence under 730 Ill. Comp. Stats.5/5-5-3.2(b)(2), 5/5-8-2(a)(1), complied with Apprendi.</SPAN></P>

As his prison term was ending the State filed proceedings to have him committed indefinitely pursuant to the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act (Act), 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 207/1 et seq. In the appeal, defendant argued that his commitment under the Act could not be squared with the principles of substantive due process because it occurred without a specific finding by the jury that he lacked volitional control over his sexually violent criminal behavior. The appellate court held that the Act required that the future danger posed by an individual be linked to the existence of a mental condition and the mental condition was required to have been one which affected an individual's ability to control his conduct. In defining &quot;sexually violent person,&quot; the Act did not refer to persons suffering from personality disorders, only to persons suffering from &quot;mental disorders.&quot; The term &quot;mental disorder&quot; was, in turn, specifically defined by the Act, and the precommitment requirement of a mental disorder, as defined by the Act, was sufficient to pass constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction in a brutal murder and rape, and the death sentence imposed thereon, were upheld on direct appeal.

The high court held, first, that all defendant's contentions had been addressed on his direct appeal. It examined the record once more solely in the interest of fundamental fairness and found, once more, that defendant's discovery rights were not violated by any evidentiary ruling, and that he had ample opportunity to challenge the DNA evidence on which he was convicted. Certain of his allegations were flatly contradicted by the record. The new Illinois Supreme Court Rules applicable to capital cases did not apply retroactively to defendant's prosecution, as they were not in themselves constitutional standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) and the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) held 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 50/1(D)(m-1) to be unconstitutional. Appellant State took a direct appeal to the state's highest appellate court, and the cases were consolidated for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state's highest appellate court held that the Adoption Act, specifically 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 50/1(D)(m-1), was an unconstitutional violation of a parent's substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Illinois Constitution. The provision impinged upon a parent's fundamental liberty interest in raising her child. Thus, it had to meet the strict scrutiny test and be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. The presumption of unfitness set forth in &sect; 50/1(D)(m-1) was not narrowly tailored to the compelling goal of identifying unfit parents, because in many cases the length of a child's stay in foster care had nothing to do with the parent's ability or inability to safely care for the child, but instead was due to circumstances beyond the parent's control. Because there would be many cases in which children remained in foster care for the statutory period even when their parents could properly care for them, the presumption was not a narrowly tailored means of identifying parents who posed a danger to their children's health or safety. The decisions of the Cook County court had become final and were therefore moot.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court determined that the act was permissible on its face because it dealt with criminal and correctional matters. The state supreme court reviewed each individual amendment in the act to determine if they all related to criminal and correctional matters.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff citizen filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant city, challenging the zoning of two parcels of property that were rezoned by the city pursuant to annexation agreements. The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss, finding that his cause of action was barred because it was filed beyond the limitations period. The Court of Appeals (Illinois) reversed the decision, and the city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that annexation and zoning were, in the abstract, distinct concepts, and that the one year statute of limitations in 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7-1-46 did not apply to the instant action. The state supreme court held that the zoning of the parcels could not be separated from the annexation. The provisions of the annexation agreements made it clear that the rezoning of the properties was an integral part of and was in fact the essential condition of and consideration for the agreements. The agreements provided that upon annexation, the tracts would be converted from county zoning to city zoning, that the zoning would remain in effect for a 20-year term, and that the corporate authorities would not rezone the properties for the life of the agreements. The citizen did not argue that there were procedural defects in the city's passage of the annexation and zoning ordinances in question, or that they did not receive notice or an opportunity to be heard. The supreme court held that the limitations period set forth in 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7-1-46 precluded the kind of belated indirect attack on the annexation that the citizen made at the instant stage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After minor was adjudicated as neglected and abused, her guardian ad litem petitioned for termination of parental rights.

The Illinois Supreme Court granted leave to appeal and held that the guardian ad litem, but not the minor, was authorized to file but not prosecute the petition. The lower court could order the State to prosecute the petition since it had authority under the Act to determine the best interests of the minor. The separation of powers doctrine was not violated because both the State and the lower court had concurrent obligations to protect the minor's best interests. The minor's rights and interests were fully represented by the guardian and the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">&nbsp;730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(a) authorized imposition of consecutive sentences on defendants convicted of very serious felonies where bodily injury was involved. Defendant's consecutive sentences for first-degree murder and armed robbery had been vacated by an intermediate appellate court, on grounds that they violated the constitutional rule of Apprendi, which precluded imposition of additional punishments based on findings, at sentencing, not made by the finder of fact on the issue of guilt or innocence. The high court held that the statute did not violate the Apprendi rule, because under Illinois law, each sentence imposed was a separate punishment for a separate offense. Whether they were served consecutively or concurrently was constitutionally irrelevant, so long as no sentence exceeded the statutory maximum. The statute simply directed a sentencing court in the exercise of its discretion.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court affirmed that defendant's rights were not violated by the police refusal, because prior to the initiation of adversary proceeding, by formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment, defendant did not have a right to counsel under U.S. Const. amends. V, VI, even where he had retained counsel or where counsel was told he could attend the lineup. Defendant could have been counseled to, and was free to, leave and not participate in the lineup. The refusal to allow his counsel to observe the witness did not transform a voluntary appearance to an involuntary search and seizure violation under U.S. Const. amend. IV or Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 (1970). The scope of protection under &sect; 6 was not greater than under U.S. Const. amend. IV.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of setting his apartment building on fire which resulted in seven people dying and numerous others being injured. Defendant confessed to the crime and there was additional incriminating evidence including witnesses. There was a question as to defendant's mental status. There was also a later hearing on the issue of whether a juror's relationship to the prosecutor compromised the juror's impartiality. The appellate court held that the trial court was in a better position to determine whether the juror was impartial and its determination that the relationship was remote did not contradict the manifest weight of the evidence. The appellate court did vacate defendant's convictions for felony murder on each count where he was already convicted of murder. However, the appellate court held a new death sentence hearing would be required due to improper remarks by the prosecution. The prosecution was not allowed to confuse the jury by arguing a statutory mitigating factor was actually an aggravating factor. Nor was the prosecution allowed to misstate the law by arguing defendant would &quot;get five freebies&quot; if he was not given the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

He also challenged the constitutionality of the Illinois death penalty statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of the heinous murder of his infant daughter. After his conviction, and after being mistakenly told that he could not have the jury instructed that the death penalty and a natural life sentence were the only available sentences under Illinois law, he waived a sentencing jury, and the trial court sentenced him to death. The high court found no error in defendant's conviction. An improper reference to defendant's invocation of Miranda rights was promptly cured, and the jury instructions were correct. However, defendant's waiver of a sentencing jury was rendered involuntary by his reliance on the understanding of the trial court, as well as all counsel, that he was not entitled to an instruction regarding sentencing options. Finally, the sentencing record showed that defendant's due process rights were violated by reliance on resources outside the record; the court directed that a different judge take over on remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but vacated for new sentencing proceeding, despite upholding death penalty's constitutionality. Defendant's waiver of sentencing jury was tainted by reliance on incorrect information received from trial court. Because trial court considered matters outside the record, new sentencing proceeding was to be conducted by another judge.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court declared that 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-109 (1996) violated the Illinois Constitution. Appellant challenged the ruling directly to the Supreme Court of Illinois.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee contended that 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-109 (1996) was unconstitutional because it arbitrarily and irrationally eliminated the common law special injury requirement for the select group of plaintiffs who were health care professionals, thereby making it far easier for these plaintiffs to file and proceed with a malicious prosecution claim than it was for other malicious prosecution plaintiffs who still had to establish a special injury. The supreme court found that &sect; 2-109 did not violate the prohibition against special legislation found in Ill. Const. 1970, art. IV, &sect; 13 and the guarantee of equal protection contained in Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, &sect; 2. There were discernible, rational reasons why the Illinois General Assembly distinguished between health care professionals who filed malicious prosecution suits against unsuccessful medical malpractice plaintiffs and all other individuals who might bring a malicious prosecution action. The classification was based upon a rational difference of situation or condition and the classification bore a reasonable relationship to the purposes of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant fatally shot a woman, pulled her from her car, and drove away in it. He was charged with first degree murder and aggravated vehicular hijacking; the latter charge was amended to armed robbery, as this charge, but not hijacking, made defendant eligible for the death penalty. He pled guilty, and after a bench trial was sentenced to death. The trial court denied his motion to withdraw his plea, and he appealed. The appellate court affirmed. As defendant was taking psychotropic medication for depression, testimony was taken concerning his competency, and the evidence showed that this medication improved rather than impaired his cognitive functioning. As there was no bona fide doubt of his fitness, lack of a formal fitness hearing did not require reversal. His counsel was not ineffective in not seeking such a hearing, or in stipulating to psychiatric testimony. There was a factual basis for the plea to armed robbery, and the prosecutor had discretion to charge him with this offense. Defendant was not entitled to withdraw his plea due to his alleged ignorance of the consequences of the armed robbery amendment. Finally, the death penalty statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff wireless telecommunications retailers and intervening plaintiff consumers sued defendant Illinois Commerce Commission, joined by intervening defendant city, claiming, inter alia, that the municipal infrastructure maintenance fee (municipal IMF) of 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 635/20, violated the Illinois Constitution. The trial court agreed with one of the plaintiffs' three constitutional claims. Each side appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Cities were allowed to impose municipal IMF's on telecommunications retailers as a percentage of the retailers' charges to customers. The retailers in the case asserted that the municipal IMF violated the Uniformity Clause of Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, because, as wireless providers, they could not be included in the class of retailers subject to the fee because they did not physically occupy the public rights-of-way. The state supreme court held (1) the municipal IMF was intended to establish a uniform system for allowing telecommunications providers to access the public rights-of-way in exchange for a fee; (2) because wireless providers did not own, operate, or maintain their infrastructure within the public rights-of-way, the trial court correctly found that subjecting them to the municipal IMF was unreasonable and violated Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2; (3) the trial court erred in finding the municipal IMF statute invalid on its face because the fact it was unconstitutional as applied to wireless providers was insufficient to render it wholly invalid with respect to all entities subject to it; and (4) it was unnecessary to address the other counts of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state supreme court affirmed the trial court's order of summary judgment that found the municipal infrastructure maintenance fee statute in violation of the Illinois Constitution's Uniformity Clause, as applied to retailers who did not own, operate, or maintain any part of their infrastructure within the public rights-of-way, but not insofar as the trial court held the statute invalid on its face.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 50/1(D)(p) (1998), defining an unfit parent, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee in adoption case gave her child up at birth for adoption. Two days later, she was transferred to the psychiatric ward. The child was placed with petitioner-appellants. The alleged birth father surrendered his parental rights. Appellants filed for adoption, contending appellee's consent was not required because she was an unfit parent as defined in 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 50/1(D)(p) (1998) of the Adoption Act. Appellee moved to dismiss, alleging the statute was unconstitutional and preempted by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12101 et seq. (1994). The circuit court held the statute unconstitutional. Appellants, the child's guardian ad litem, and the state's attorney general all filed notices of appeal to the state supreme court. They were consolidated. The supreme court applied strict scrutiny in reviewing the statute, as it implicated a custodial parent's liberty interest under the due process clause, overruling prior appellate decisions holding or suggesting otherwise, and found the statute was constitutional. It reversed the circuit court and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Order finding section of adoption statute unconstitutional was reversed. Circuit court's refusal to follow appellate authority was error. Its determination that statute was unconstitutionally vague was premature. Prior appellate decisions imposing rational relation scrutiny were overruled, as state's interest in protecting minors was sufficiently compelling to satisfy strict due process scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, armed violence, and two counts of aggravated battery for intentionally or knowingly causing great bodily harm and for using a deadly weapon, in connection with stabbing his girlfriend and her daughter, killing his girlfriend. His sentences were to run concurrently. The appellate court affirmed, but ordered the mittimus be amended to reflect only one aggravated battery conviction. Defendant argued this conviction should be vacated because it stemmed from the same physical act as the armed violence charge. The State claimed the daughter's three stab wounds were three separate acts sustaining three convictions. The supreme court found that each wound could have supported a separate offense but that was not how the State charged defendant, or presented and argued the case. The indictment did not differentiate among the daughter's separate stab wounds but charged the same conduct, stabbing, under four different theories of criminal culpability; in other words, a single act charged four different ways. As the State made no attempt to apportion the crimes among the stab wounds, the court would not do so on appeal.</SPAN></P>

There was no merit to defendant's argument that the statute violated the separation of powers under Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant builders won review of Illinois court of appeals' reversal of trial court judgment in class action against appellee county for refund of impact fees collected by county under statutes and ordinances later invalidated as unconstitutional. Appellate court held suit was barred by statute of limitation of 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-205 (1996) and laches, as appellants waited over five years after paying the fees to seek a refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants were homebuilders in appellee county. A 1987 enabling act allowed appellee to establish and collect road impact fees from builders. Appellee passed implementing ordinances. In 1995, in another case, the enabling act and implementing ordinances were held unconstitutional and fees were ordered returned. Appellants, not parties to that suit, later requested return of their fees. Appellee refused. Appellants filed a class action to force return of the fees and sought summary judgment, which was granted. The circuit court certified a class, created a common fund for its benefit, ordered appellee to transfer a certain sum into the fund, and awarded attorneys fees. The appellate court reversed, holding the suit was barred by the statute of limitation in 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-205 (1996), or laches. The supreme court granted leave to appeal and affirmed, holding the five-year statute of limitations applied and the cause of action had accrued when the fees were paid, not after the statute was invalidated, analogizing impact fee refunds to tax refunds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellate court judgment was affirmed, as appellants' action was barred by the five-year statute of limitation, because their cause of action accrued on the date they paid the challenged impact fees and not on the date the statute authorizing the fees was held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that proceedings of the commission that served the legislative branch must be public. The trial court believed that plaintiffs could seek declaratory relief in advance of commission proceedings. The trial court also concluded that defendant was a proper party. He appealed. Declaratory relief was obtainable only when there was an actual controversy between adverse parties. The trial court should have refused to enter a declaratory judgment, as it appeared the judgment would not terminate the controversy. 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-701(a) (West 1998). An adjudication of the merits of this appeal would have constituted merely an advisory opinion. Defendant had no role in the allegedly improper application of the statutes; he possessed no control over the legislative branch ethics commission's compliance with the constitutional provision that formed the basis of plaintiffs' suit.</SPAN></P>

The confession was voluntary, and there was no deceitful conduct which prevented defendant from consulting with his attorney. Defendant was not entitled to the appointment of new counsel to represent him on his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The sentencing jury was sufficiently instructed on the mental state necessary for finding defendant eligible for the death penalty. It was not an abuse of discretion to deny defendant's request for a continuance of the second stage of the capital sentencing hearing. The introduction of a victim impact statement during that stage was not reversible error. The death penalty was an appropriate sentence for defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in trial court for first degree murder and armed robbery, and sentenced to death. Following unsuccessful appeals, defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court dismissed defendant's post-conviction petition without a hearing, stating both that the petition was untimely and that the petition was patently without merit. Defendant appealed, claiming that the petition was timely and that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that the death eligibility finding was constitutionally deficient, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the death eligibility hearing, and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the aggravation and mitigation stage of his death penalty sentencing hearing. The court affirmed, holding that defendant failed to show that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to dispute his death penalty eligibility as constitutionally deficient or ineffective at the death eligibility hearing, and that defendant failed to identify any evidence that might have changed the trial court's ruling at the aggravation and mitigation stage of his death penalty sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his conviction, by jury, of two counts of first degree murder, and death sentence for having committed two or more murders, by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), for the shooting deaths of jewelry store owners whose store was robbed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Six years after a jewelry store was robbed and its two owners found shot to death, defendant, after being interviewed, admitted involvement and blamed his codefendant for the shootings. At his simultaneous severed trial, defendant testified differently: that his codefendant was responsible for the robbery and that defendant was involved out of fear. The jury did not receive Ill. Pattern Jury Instructions, Crim. No. 2.02 and 2.03 (3rd ed. 1992), on the presumption of innocence. Defendant was convicted of the murders and death-sentenced for having committed two. The court affirmed. The jury had been adequately instructed at length regarding the innocence presumption and need not have been questioned individually on their understanding. Counsel was not ineffective in that defendant was not prejudiced by the instructions' absence. Evidence was overwhelming concerning defendant's assistance in the crimes. Evidence of defendant's gang affiliation was used to rebut his implication that a state witness was not truthful. The trial court took steps to ensure defendant was not unduly prejudiced by mention of a prior conviction, and took two weeks to deliberate over his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was affirmed. Jury received adequate innocence-presumption instruction despite not getting statutory instructions and gang affiliation and prior conviction evidence was not unduly prejudicial to defendant. Trial court took all defendant's evidence into consideration in two-week deliberation over death sentence. Sentence was based on double murder and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. VI, &sect; 4(b) (1970), and Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 603, 609(a), 134 Ill. 2d. R. 603, 609(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of killing two young women with shotgun and semiautomatic weapons and leaving their bodies in a field. The State put on a strong circumstantial case which the defense rebutted aggressively but unsuccessfully. The evidence showed the victims were in a car defendant claimed the driver kept stealing from him, he threatened the driver with a shotgun within hours of the murders, he had a violent history, and one of the murder weapons was purchased by his wife and shipped to him. It also showed he wiped down the van rented the night of the murders and threw away a pair of boots to eliminate evidence. Premeditated double murder was sufficiently aggravating to warrant the death penalty. On direct review, defendant claimed violation of his speedy trial rights, insufficient evidence and erroneous evidentiary rulings, ineffective assistance of counsel, marital privilege, and cumulative error. He also challenged the death penalty statute. The court affirmed, finding there was no plain error and other errors were harmless. Counsel was not ineffective. Defendant was not prejudiced or denied a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed. The few errors committed in the trial and sentencing were harmless, because the result would have been the same. Defendant's speedy-trial motion did not present an issue of fact outside the record material to disposition of the motion. The evidence was sufficient. A rational trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The State presented a strong circumstantial case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee grandmother petitioned for visitation pursuant to 750 Ill. Comp.

They moved to dismiss the petition and argued the statute should not have been interpreted to allow a grandparent to sue for visitation. They also contended the statute as applied was an unconstitutional infringement on a fundamental liberty interest. The trial court denied the motion. Appellants' request for an interlocutory appeal was denied. The court granted permission to appeal. The court held the statute's plain language permitted a grandparent to seek such visitation. Even so, the court reversed the trial court's denial of appellants' motion to dismiss. It held under strict scrutiny analysis, applied because the fundamental right to raise children was involved, the statute was unconstitutional as the state had no compelling interest in forcing appellants, who had not been found to be unfit, to allow visitation they had decided they did not want for their minor children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">For a few months defendant lied to others, including her probation officer, that she was pregnant, then she was arrested while holding the baby from a mother who had been killed and whose womb had been cut open a day earlier. Also slain were two of the mother's other children. Defendant, her boyfriend, and cousin were separately tried for murder and she was convicted and sentenced to death. The court affirmed. Evidence was overwhelming. Defendant admitted she had wanted a baby and that she was present at the killings. Defendant aided the principals under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-2(c) (1994) by conferring with them, getting a gun, and visiting the crime scene shortly before the murders. Testimony of a kidnapped later-murdered child's statements was admissible under 725 Ill. Comp.

The appellate court reversed and ordered the cause remanded for a limited non-evidentiary hearing. The court reversed and ordered the convictions vacated because there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions for possession of title without complete assignment.

Petitioner filed a post-conviction petition, alleging the judge's massive corruption violated his right to a fair trial guaranteed by the due process clauses of the United States and Illinois Constitutions. The State's motion to dismiss the petition was granted without evidentiary hearing, because petitioner did not establish a nexus between the judge's criminal conduct and petitioner's murder trial. The court affirmed the constitutionality of the death penalty statute and held his ineffective assistance claims barred by res judicata, but reversed the denial of his discovery request for the judge's confession and related investigatory interviews, ordering production of the discovery and subsequent reconsideration of whether the judge's criminal conduct violated petitioner's due process right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment dismissing post-conviction petition without evidentiary hearing was affirmed in part, but circuit court's denial of petitioner's discovery request for judge's confession and related witness interviews was reversed, with directions to order production of those materials and enter new ruling on due process issue.</SPAN></P>

(West 1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of failing to register in compliance with the Illinois Sex Offender Registration Act, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 150/1 et seq. (West 1998). Although that statute had already survived constitutional challenge, the court considered defendant's challenge to a related statute dealing with consequences of registration, the Illinois Sex Offender and Child Murderer Community Notification Law, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 152/101 et seq. The burden was on defendant to show unconstitutionality and he failed to carry it. His primary argument was that the statute violated the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9, 10 and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 prohibitions against ex post facto laws. While the statute was clearly retroactive, the court found that its intent and effect were not primarily punitive, but protective of the public, as it was clearly tailored to provide only limited dissemination of information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, because he failed to meet his burden to show the statutes' unconstitutionality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee victim sued appellant priest, appellant parish, and appellant diocese, alleging appellant priest had sexually abused her when she was a teenager and had intentionally inflicted upon her emotional distress. Appellee did not file her claims until over 20 years after the alleged physical abuse occurred. However, evidence revealed appellant priest had threatened appellee that the Roman Catholic Church would excommunicate her and her family if she revealed he had sexually assaulted her. The trial court granted appellants' motions to dismiss, finding appellee's claims were barred by the statute of repose for childhood sexual abuse claims. The lower appellate court reversed. Judgment was reversed. Appellee was aware as a teenager that appellant priest had done something wrong to her after the latter performed a forced abortion on appellee. Appellee's failure to understand the connection between the sexual abuse and other psychological injuries did not toll the statute of limitations. Appellee was not legally disabled for purposes of tolling the limitations period even though appellants' conduct may have rendered her &quot;psychiatrically unable&quot; to take legal action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment reversed; appellee neither demonstrated that a legal disability tolled the two-year limitations period nor showed that equitable estoppel prevented appellants from raising the statute of limitations as a defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction because the insanity statute in effect when the crime occurred was unconstitutional. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, home invasion, and residential burglary.

After the trial court denied defendant's constitutional argument, the state supreme court ruled the statute unconstitutional. Therefore, the court reversed defendant's conviction and ordered a new trial. The court held that the trial court could not have applied the new statute because such application would have violated the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant death row inmate sought review of an order the Circuit Court of DuPage County (Illinois), which denied his amended petition without hearing under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1 et seq. (1994). Defendant also challenged constitutionality of the death penalty, Ill. Rev. Stat.  ch. 38, para. 9-1(g) (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1985, defendant was convicted numerous crimes including murder, and at a separate hearing defendant was sentenced to death under Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, para. 9-1(b)(6) (1985). On three separate occasions, the court affirmed convictions but vacated the death sentence and remanded for new hearings. In 1997, defendant filed an amended petition under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1 et seq. (1994), which was summarily denied without an evidentiary hearing. The court affirmed in part, holding that many of defendant's issues had been raised in previous appeals and thus were barred by res judicata. Furthermore, defendant had waived many issues not raised previously. Although defendant conceded that many claims were either barred or waived, he argued that both his trial and appellate counsel was ineffective; thus, the issues were addressed. Generally, the court rejected defendant's ineffective assistance claims, however, the court reversed and remanded with instructions to hold a evidentiary hearing on the claim that alleged perjury affected the determination to impose the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Sentence reversed and remanded with instructions; dismissal of claims of allegedly false testimony without an evidentiary hearing was improper because, after a review of the entire transcript, the court was unable to conclude that there existed no reasonable likelihood that alleged perjury would not have affected the jury's determination to impose the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The trial court then sentenced defendant to death for felony murder without holding a sentencing hearing.

The trial court's sentencing of defendant without a hearing was contrary to the court's previous order. The court had vacated defendant's death sentence and instructed the trial court that defendant could have been sentenced on the felony-murder conviction for which he had not yet received a sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Drunk driving defendant's blood alcohol test results, obtained while he was in the emergency room following an automobile accident, were turned over to law enforcement authorities pursuant to 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501.4-1 (West 1996). He sought exclusion, arguing that the statute violated his right of privacy guaranteed by Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court held the statute constitutional. Driving was not a right, but a privilege. In exchange for that privilege, defendant waived constitutional rights where reasonable to promote public safety. Defendant also challenged the statute for violating privacy rights when applied to pedestrians; the court held that he lacked standing because he was not a pedestrian. Finally, he challenged the statute as violating separation of powers, because the judiciary had exclusive control over discovery. The court held that permitting disclosure to law enforcement had nothing to do with control of discovery or separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings. The statutory waiver of privacy rights in exchange for driving privileges was reasonable and therefore constitutional. Defendant lacked standing to challenge law on behalf of non-drivers. Finally, permitting reporting of results to law enforcement did not violate separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the post-conviction petition and motion to vacate. The court affirmed the judgment, finding the trial court properly dismissed defendant's motion to vacate. The court noted that the evidence presented by defendant did not provide a proper basis for relief because it did not exist at the time of defendant's fitness hearing and therefore could not have been presented to the trial court for consideration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder for the shooting deaths of three people during a drug transaction in the victims' home. The State presented numerous witnesses, including an eye witness, and physical evidence, which indicated premeditation. Defendant testified, claiming self-defense and accusing the eyewitness, but his story was inconsistent and unsupported. The jury sentenced him to death after a separate hearing at which aggravating factors, including other murders and attempted murders, and mitigating factors, including psychological testimony, were presented. On direct appeal, defendant argued there should have been an accomplice jury instruction, an uncorroborated inculpatory statement from the eyewitness, testimony from defendant's mother should have been admitted, the death-eligibility verdict forms were erroneous, and there should have been inquiry into defendant's mental fitness. His convictions and death sentence were affirmed, the court finding any error, such as verdict forms, was harmless; defendant was presumed fit for trial, and counsel was not ineffective.</SPAN></P>

Respondents argued purchase's noncompliance with Illinois Counties Code, 55 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1-1001 et seq. (West 1998) and Cook County, Ill. Ordinances ch. 10, &sect;&sect; 17, 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After respondent county and official refused to approve purchase of a mainframe computer and software using monies of the Illinois Court Document Storage Fund, petitioner circuit court clerk arranged for the purchase herself and instituted a mandamus proceeding to compel respondents to pay for it. The court held that respondents were not required to pay for the purchase, because petitioner failed to comply with approval requirements of the Illinois Counties Code, 55 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1-1001 et seq. (West 1998), and applicable county ordinances. The Illinois Clerks of Court Act did not empower clerks to authorize fund expenditures on their own, but only to approve purchases that were authorized under normal county procedures. This arrangement did not violate separation of powers principles, because in Illinois counties had many responsibilities for running and financial administration of courts. Because this provision did not infringe courts' inherent authority, it was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the writ, because the statute expressly denied petitioner authority to dictate how the disputed funds should have been spent, and subjected expenditures to approval by respondents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death.

The court affirmed the judgment, noting that it could not have found defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant had shown neither that his attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness nor that a reasonable probability existed that, had his attorney pursued another line of defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Additionally, the court determined the issue of hearsay evidence was waived because defendant failed to object when the evidence was introduced.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the circuit court of St. Clair County (Illinois) which convicted him of first degree murder and sentenced him to because the jury found, under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(b)(11), 5/9-1(b)(6) (West 1994), that there were no factors sufficient to preclude imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Defendant robbed a store and shot the clerk. The court affirmed the conviction, finding sufficient evidence for a jury to convict. The trial court properly excluded testimony of a witness as not against his penal interest. The court reversed the death penalty and remanded for new sentencing. On the record, no reasonable trier of fact could have found murder was committed by the death sentence statutory requirement of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(b)(11) (1994) &quot;in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner pursuant to a preconceived plan, scheme, or design.&quot; The murder and robbery took place in less than a minute. Time for reflection was a requirement of that statute. Jury verdict did not contain requisite mens rea finding for felony-murder statutory aggravating factor under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(b)(6) (1994). The court could not usurp the jury's sentencing function since defendant had elected for jury to sentence. Death penalty could only be reconsidered under felony-murder, since error based upon flawed verdict form, and not under the premeditated factor, because that would violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction was affirmed, but the sentence was vacated and remanded for new sentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed a medical malpractice action against defendants alleging that decedent died as a proximate cause of defendants' negligence. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, contending they were immune from liability under the Local Government and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/1-101 et seq. (1992). The trial court granted summary judgment. The court affirmed, noting that because the gravamen of plaintiff's action against defendants was that defendants' failure either to perform examinations or to adequately perform examinations led to defendants' failure to diagnose decedent's breast cancer, which, in turn, proximately caused her death, the immunity provided to local public entities and their public employees in 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/6-105, -106, applied. Specifically, the court determined that &sect; 6-105 immunity applied to defendants' alleged failure to conduct physical examinations. In addition, &sect; 6-106 immunity applied because of defendants' failure to diagnose breast cancer when defendants rendered no medical treatment to decedent in relation to her breast condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, on death row in Illinois, had twice petitioned unsuccessfully for post-conviction relief and also unsuccessfully petitioned for writ of habeas corpus. The court held that under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, a criminal defendant faced severe procedural bars to any petition after the first. Petitioner had to show good cause, an objective factor external to the defense that impeded earlier efforts, for failure to raise claims in prior proceedings and actual prejudice, meaning an error that so infected the trial that conviction violated due process, resulting from claimed errors. This petitioner failed to show actual prejudice. Petitioner claimed that counsel was ineffective based on counsel's failure to request a hearing on fitness for trial due to ingestion of psychotropic drugs. Since by Illinois law psychotropic drugs were not a basis for claiming unfitness for trial, petitioner was not prejudiced by failure to hold a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction and death sentence by the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois) for first-degree murder, attempted first degree murder, and armed robbery. The appeal was based upon denial of motions to suppress his statements made after his alleged arrest without probable cause, to not have indictment read to jury, and to limit cross examination of a State witness, wrongful dismissal of a juror, and ineffective counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, attempted first degree murder, and armed robbery, based upon his 1994 actions in a robbery causing the death of a young woman and the injury of her husband. Upon appeal the court affirmed the circuit court's convictions and death sentence. The court found probable cause at time of the warrantless arrest based upon the totality of the circumstances which included an informant's lead based on more than casual rumor. Defendant also had given a false name to officers. Therefore his post-Miranda statements were admissible. Indictment reading to jury at fitness hearing was not prejudicial as it did not relate details of the attack and instructions limiting issues to fitness were given to the jury. State lab witness properly not cross-examined on theft of a microscope as the relevance of that issue to his fabrication of evidence was remote and uncertain. Not error to dismiss juror for cause for religious beliefs against death penalty. Judge's and prosecutor's comments to jury were not reversible error. Under Strickland counsel not ineffective for withholding a witness for strategic reasons. Death penalty was reaffirmed as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denying him post-conviction relief following his conviction and sentence to death for the rape and murder of two women.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death for the rape and murder of two women. The court affirmed the order of the circuit court which denied him post-conviction relief. The circuit's court's determinations following its evidentiary hearing were not to be disturbed unless manifestly erroneous. Evidence supported that court's finding that the trial judge did not indicate in ex parte discussions that he would not impose the death sentence if defendant pled guilty. The trial had proceeded as a stipulated bench trial. Evidence had also supported that court's finding that there had not been ineffective trial, post-conviction relief, or appellate counsel, in the waiver of jury trial for guilt or sentencing, and in the presentation of mitigating evidence in the sentencing phase, and for strategic choices. The court stated that the additional evidence of defendant's troubled family and youth was not inherently mitigating, could be construed as aggravating, and was corroborative of other evidence. Lack of evidence at sentencing was not prejudicial where the outcome would probably have been the same, so the court concluded counsel was not ineffective for not presenting it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order was affirmed. Circuit court decisions following its evidentiary hearing were not manifestly erroneous. The decisions included that the trial judge did not agree in ex parte discussions with defense counsel to not impose the death penalty if defendant pled guilty and waived a jury trial, that not presenting more evidence of defendant's troubled youth was not prejudicial, and that counsel was not ineffective for strategic decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After appellee was charged with the offense of permitting the sexual abuse of a child, she filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that 720 Ill.

The motion was granted and appellant state appealed. The supreme court affirmed the circuit court's order dismissing the charge against appellee, holding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it was not clear what the &quot;reasonable steps&quot; were that a parent must take in order to avoid criminal prosecution under the statute. Specifically, the court found that the statute left a parent to speculate as to what the statute commanded and that it was unclear what a parent must do to take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; under the statute, and that authorities remained without standards to guide their enforcement of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of first degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, and armed robbery, and sentenced him to death, after considering aggravation and mitigation testimony. On direct review, the supreme court affirmed. Defendant killed a 19-year-old girl after instigating a savage beating and rape when she stole $ 50 cocaine. Four eyewitnesses testified against defendant. Defendant put the victim in the trunk of her own car with a pillowcase over her head and drove off with a shotgun. The victim was found dead in an empty lot from a shotgun wound to the head, still wearing the pillowcase. The court found defendant's ineffective assistance of trial counsel and improper evidentiary rulings and closing arguments had been waived and were not subject to plain error, and his disparate sentence was not inappropriate as codefendant was not similarly situated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Conviction and death penalty were affirmed, as court found no plain error excusing any of defendant's procedural defaults, and would not address issues waived by defendant. Sentence disparity with co-defendant's sentence was not improper as co-defendant was not similarly situated or culpable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the dismissal of his petition for post-conviction relief by the Circuit Court of Livingston County (Illinois) after his conviction and death sentence by the same court for the gang-related conspiracy to murder and the actual murder of a superintendent of the prison where defendant was serving a sentence for another murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While defendant was in prison for murder, he and another inmate murdered a prison superintendent, following prison gang instructions. Defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed the dismissal of his motion for postconviction relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1. The court affirmed the dismissal. The death sentence was not unreasonably disparate. The other murderer was sentenced to death, and the gang members who ordered the murder were sentenced to life. The sentence was not arbitrary or capricious. Under the Strickland analysis defendant received effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. Constitutional ineffective assistance claims were not to be another way of rearguing issues previously addressed. Defendant was not unfit for trial because he was mentally unsound, unwilling to cooperate with counsel, or suicidal. The State had race neutral reasons for excluding venireman after Batson challenge including that he lived in a gang area. Defendant's prior murder conviction and prison conduct were relevant aggravators as was the cold-blooded and calculated assassination of a prison official.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dismissal was affirmed. Strickland test applied to determine defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of trial or appellate counsel. Defendant could not raise indirectly through ineffective assistance claim those objections that should have been made at trial or on direct appeal. Sentence was not unreasonably disparate.</SPAN></P>
