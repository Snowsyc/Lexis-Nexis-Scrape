The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) gravely erred in suppressing the hammer; [4]-The evidence plainly demonstrated a sufficient nexus between defendant's attack on his wife and her subsequent death, providing the requisite basis under Haw.

Accordingly, the circuit court, on remand, was to engage in an in camera review of the requested records and balance the public interest and the officers' significant privacy interest in each instance to determine whether disclosure was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">HOLDINGS: [1]-In State v. Won, the Supreme Court held that coercion engendered by the implied consent form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that waiver of a constitutional right may only be the result of a free and unconstrained choice, and, thus, a defendant's decision to submit to testing after being read the implied consent form is invalid as a waiver of his or her right not to be searched; [2]-In accordance with State v. Won, the result of defendant's breath test was the product of a warrantless search, and the district court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress the breath test result; [3]-Accordingly, defendant's conviction for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant could not stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Supreme Court vacated the intermediate appellate court's judgment on appeal and the district court's judgment and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-Although the charge failed to allege an element of the crime of OVUII, because the charge did not state that the offense took place on a public road, subject-matter jurisdiction was not abrogated by the charging instrument failing to allege a statutory element defining the offense. Thus, the fact that the OVUII charge failed to allege an element of the offense did not extinguish the criminal jurisdiction of the district court, under Haw. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held the motion to substitute counsel was untimely. The supreme court held denying the motion erred because defendant was denied his right to counsel of his choice under Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. It was an abuse of discretion to deny the motion because (1) the trial court did not balance defendant's right to counsel of his choice against countervailing government interests, such as length of the delay requested, impact on the prosecution, witnesses or the court, and whether the delay was for a dilatory purpose, and (2) those other factors showed an abuse of discretion, as there was no apparent prejudice to the State, the record showed no inconvenience to the trial court, particularly since it subsequently ordered a one-week continuance, no witnesses who would have been inconvenienced were present, and there had been only one prior, stipulated, continuance. Defendant did not have to show prejudice because this required speculation as to how private counsel would have represented defendant, which was an inquiry the U.S. Supreme Court rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of manslaughter and a jury determined under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-662 that an extended term of imprisonment was necessary for the protection of the public. The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), Hawai'i, affirmed, and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Supreme Court of Hawai'i held that defendant was not prejudiced when the trial court read to the entire jury venire a publicity statement that included the information that it had been reported in the media that the victim had intervened in an argument between defendant and his wife and had been described as a Good Samaritan. The statement was a factual description of the offense, the trial court expressed no opinion as to the correctness of the media reports, and it conducted extensive voir dire. At sentencing, it was reversible error to instruct the jury, with regard to its fact finding on extended term of imprisonment, about the procedures of the Hawai'i Paroling Authority and that the sentence included the possibility of parole. The jury should instead have been instructed and asked whether it was necessary to extend the sentence from a possible 20-year sentence to a possible life sentence for the protection of the public. The hearsay error in admitting at sentencing evidence about a prior assault was also prejudicial because that evidence could have been enough alone for the jury to find that an extended term of imprisonment was necessary to protect the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the judgment of the ICA in part as to the harmlessness of evidentiary error and as to defendant's extended term sentence, and affirmed the ICA's judgment in all other respects. The court vacated the judgment of conviction and sentence in part as to the same matters, affirmed the judgment of conviction in all other respects, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari after the Hawai'i Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed his convictions under Haw. Admin. R. 13-146-4(a) (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant received citations when he was found residing in a closed area of a state park. He filed a motion to dismiss based on Haw. Const. art. XII, &sect; 7. The trial court denied the motion and found defendant guilty. The ICA affirmed the conviction, and defendant's subsequent application for a writ of certiorari was granted. In affirming, the supreme court noted that it was proper for the trial court and the ICA to undertake a balancing test after defendant satisfied the three-factor Hanapi test. In applying the totality of the circumstances test to the facts of this case, the balancing of interests weighed in favor of permitting the park to regulate defendant's activity, his argument of privilege notwithstanding. The regulation served several important purposes, including maintaining the park for public use and preserving the environment of the park. Moreover, defendant did not show any attempt to engage in his native Hawaiian practice within the limits of state law. Defendant's activities did not fall under constitutional protection because his interest in conducting activities without a permit did not outweigh the State's interest in limiting the number of visitors to the park.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bidder argued that read together, Haw. Rev.

The supreme court found that the bidder could not seek review of the chief procurement officer's decision on a chapter 103F health and human services contract pursuant to chapter 103D unless the protest was decided under one of the sections listed in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 103D-709(c). This foreclosed the bidder from seeking review of the chief procurement officer's decision made pursuant to Haw. Rev.

Judicial review was available by way of declaratory action pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632-1. The bidder would be able to sue to enforce chapter 103F under the declaratory judgment statute. There was no due process or equal protection violation since chapter 103F, as interpreted, allowed for judicial review. Chapter 103F, as construed, did not prohibit judicial review through Haw. Rev.

The court held that no separation of powers violation resulted from the agency's exercise of the judicial power reserved to the courts by Haw. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1 because the declaratory judgment statute,&nbsp;Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632-1 (1993), provided a remedy to obtain judicial review of the agency's ruling. Pursuant to Haw. Rev.

The protestor could not maintain a negligence action under the State Tort Liability Act, Haw. Rev.

The appellate court found not error in the family court's findings that the father's actions were not reasonably calculated to promote the minor's welfare. On review, the court held that the appropriate standard for family courts to apply in contested Haw. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The First Circuit Court of Hawai'i found that plaintiffs, teachers association and union, were likely to succeed on their Haw.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor argued that the circuit court erred because it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute. The supreme court found that because the plaintiffs did not raise statutory issues in their complaint, the case presented the question of whether the reasoning in a prior case applied when the plaintiffs raised constitutional issues while omitting references to statutory issues the HLRB had exclusive jurisdiction over. The supreme court found that it did. Plaintiffs did not refer to Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 89 in their complaint when arguing that the imposition of furloughs violated Haw. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2. Nevertheless, the prior case applied. The plain language of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-14 supported concluding that the case was a controversy concerning prohibited practices that first had to be submitted to the HLRB. The circuit court erred by failing to allow the HLRB to decide the issues relating to chapter 89 before deciding the constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that the prosecutor's statements that defendant benefitted from his trial presence and was thus less credible because he heard the testimony of other witnesses and heard during voir dire that eye contact with the jurors was an indicator of trustworthiness constituted prohibited generic tailoring arguments. The prosecutor's comments regarding defendant's manner of testifying improperly transformed his presence at trial into an automatic burden on his credibility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, the parents of a minor patient, brought an action against defendant medical center. The jury found for plaintiffs on the informed consent claim and for defendant on the negligent treatment claim. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit, Hawai'i, granted judgment as a matter of law for plaintiffs on the negligent treatment claim and entered judgment for $4,525,000 in damages. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The doctor treated the patient for lupus using steroids. Her parents sued for negligent treatment and failure to obtain informed consent. In two interrogatories, the jury was asked whether the second and third pulses of steroids caused the patient's injuries and gave different responses. The jury's verdict was irreconcilable because it found the doctor's treatment did not cause the patient's injuries in the negligence claim, but that his failure to properly inform was a legal cause of the patient's injuries. Because there was substantial evidence supporting the verdict of no causation, the circuit court wrongly granted plaintiffs' motion for judgment as a matter of law on the negligence claim. The circuit court did not err by denying defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the informed consent claim, because an alternative dosage of the same medication was a recognized alternative treatment under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 671-3(b)(4) (Supp. 2009) and plaintiffs were not required to prove they were injured by a risk that was not disclosed to them. Expert testimony indicating a physician was required to disclose her experience with a treatment was contrary to Hawai'i law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was vacated, and the case was remanded to the circuit court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers, who were not native Hawaiian, filed suit seeking an exemption from real property taxes equal to the exemption granted to Hawaiian homestead lessees under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA), arguing that the tax exemptions for homestead lessees involve discrimination on the basis of race because only native Hawaiians are eligible to become homestead lessees under the HHCA. The State moved for summary judgment, arguing that the disputed tax exemptions did not violate the equal protection clause because they did not involve a suspect classification. On review of summary judgment, the court held that the taxpayers lacked standing to pursue their challenges to the constitutionality of the tax exemption and the HHCA because the record failed to establish that the taxpayers were interested in participating in the homestead lease program.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was convicted of second-degree murder. On appeal, the Hawai'i Intermediate Court of Appeals found that the court erred in admitting the testimony of a federal agent regarding the time-frame during which the revolver purportedly used in the murder was fired, but upheld portions of the trial court's findings. The court of appeals remanded for a new trial. Petitioner and the State applied for further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner argued that the intermediate court of appeals gravely erred by determining that federal law rather than Hawai'i law should be applied to his suppression motion. The supreme court found that State v. Bridges, 83 Hawai'i 187, 925 P.2d 357 (1996) did not reflect a consistent application of the exclusionary rule analysis. Therefore, it was overruled insofar as it was inconsistent with the instant opinion. Where evidence sought to be admitted in state court was the product of acts that occurred on federal property or in another state, by Hawai'i law enforcement officers or officers of another jurisdiction, due consideration must be given to the Hawai'i Constitution and applicable case law. However, the inspection of petitioner's vehicle by a naval officer, when entering a naval base, was not unreasonable under the Hawai'i Constitution. By entering onto the base, petitioner consented to a search of his vehicle. Inasmuch as petitioner's privacy rights under the Hawai'i Constitution were not invaded by the searches, the individual privacy rights prong of the exclusionary rule analysis did not weigh in favor of suppression.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The intermediate court of appeal's opinion was corrected insofar as it concluded that federal law alone was to be considered in ruling on petitioner's motion to suppress. The order of the trial court denying petitioner's motion to suppress under federal law and the Hawai'i Constitution was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff county brought two actions to condemn the property of defendant owner. Following a prior remand, the Third Circuit Court, Hawaii, found that condemnation 2 was not pretextual, set compensation for that property, denied the owner's request for prejudgment interest, and denied attorneys' fees relating to condemnation 1. The owner's motion to transfer the second appeal to the Hawaii Supreme Court was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court declined to create a per se rule that condemnations instituted pursuant to a contract that delegated the power of eminent domain were invalid as a matter of law, without inquiry into any benefits that might result from the taking, rendering tainted any condemnation instituted before the contract was repudiated or invalidated. The court also found no support in the record for finding that complying with the development agreement predominated over the public purpose of building a traffic corridor for the public at large, for finding that the actual purpose was to avoid liability for attorneys' fees and costs, or for finding that the actual reason was to provide an overwhelming benefit to third-party defendant developer. The trial court incorrectly determined that there could be no recovery for fees and expenses incurred in litigating the propriety of fees under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 101-27; it therefore abused its discretion in failing to consider whether the owner was entitled to those attorneys' fees. Finally, although prejudgment interest could be recovered as an &quot;other reasonable expense&quot; under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 101-27, the owner's request for interest was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the circuit court's conclusion that condemnation 2 was not pretextual, its valuation of just compensation set for the property in condemnation 2, and its denial of the owner's request for prejudgment interest. The court remanded for the circuit court to decide the owner's request for attorneys fees associated with the preparation of billing records and/or preparation of fee petitions in condemnation 1.</SPAN></P>

The governor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor argued that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-14 (1993) gave the Hawai'i Labor Relations Board (HLRB) original jurisdiction over the statutory claims in the case, and the circuit court acted beyond its jurisdiction by ruling on questions intended exclusively for HLRB. The supreme court found that HGEA alleged that the governor essentially engaged in a &quot;prohibited practice&quot; when she unilaterally imposed furloughs. the HLRB had jurisdiction to resolve controversies under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-5(i)(3). Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-14 provided that the HLRB would have exclusive and original jurisdiction over any controversy concerning prohibited practices. The HLRB had exclusive original jurisdiction over the statutory claims raised in HGEA's complaint. The language that HGEA relied on in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-14 did not refer to original jurisdiction. A constitutional analysis was unnecessary for the HLRB to adjudicate the statutory issues that were presented in HGEA's first amended complaint. The record did not establish that recourse to the procedure set forth in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 380-14(b) would be either futile or impractical.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The objector, a recognized cultural descendant of Native Hawaiian burial remains found at a construction site, testified against their relocation. After her request for a contested case hearing was denied, she filed a notice of agency appeal. The circuit court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction because there was no contested case hearing. A settlement was later reached, and the objector conceded that the appeal had become moot. The court held that the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine applied because the proper disposition of burial remains was an issue of public importance as to which recurrence was likely and a ruling would provide future guidance. The court concluded that the objector had met the requirements for jurisdiction under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 91-14 because a contested case hearing as defined in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 91-1(5) (1993) was required by law, as provided in Haw. Admin. R. 13-300-51, 13-300-52, 13-300-53; the denial was a final order, and the objector followed agency rules and had standing. Rule 13-300-53 was consistent with Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6E-1, 6E-43 and did not exceed the agency's rulemaking authority under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 6E-43.5 (2009).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a homeless man who camped at a beach park, in accordance with a permit issued to him by the City of Honolulu. One evening an officer cited defendant for illegal camping, in violation of Honolulu, Haw., Rev. Ordinances &sect; 10-1.2(a)(13), because he believed defendant's permit was not valid on Wednesdays when park maintenance was performed. The prosecution's use of the word &quot;area&quot; instead of &quot;park&quot; in the oral charge did not substantially prejudice defendant, because he had actual knowledge of the nature of the charges against him. The Supreme Court of Hawai'i held that the trial court erred in convicting defendant for illegal camping. There was insufficient evidence to show that defendant illegally camped &quot;in any park not designated as a campground&quot; because: (1) the beach park was designated as a campground; (2) defendant was in the designated camping area on the night he was cited; and (3) the park's designation as a campground did not change on Wednesdays.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charter school acquired land zoned for agricultural use with the intent to use it as a working farm and campus. When a dispute arose between the charter school and neighboring property owners regarding whether the charter school was required to obtain a special use permit under Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 205, the county filed a declaratory action seeking a resolution of the issue. The property owners filed a cross-claim against the school, seeking to enforce the statutory provisions. The circuit court entered a default judgment against the charter school, and both parties sought review. The court of appeals determined that the property owners had no private right of action to enforce ch. 205 and that the circuit court therefore lacked jurisdiction to determine the claims. On review, the court held that Haw. Const. art. XI, &sect;  9, created a private right of action to enforce Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 205 in the circumstances of this case and that the appellate accordingly erred in its analysis. However, the judgment in favor of the property owners could not be affirmed because the circuit court erred in declining to set aside the entry of default against the charter school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the use of force in defense of others under Haw.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 703-304 (1993 and Supp. 2003). However, the error was harmless because there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that defendant was justified in using force in defense of others. Further, although there was concurrent representation of defendant and a hostile witness by the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) in a matter unrelated to defendant's trial, defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel due to a conflict of interest under Haw. Prof. Conduct R. 1.9 because the concurrent representation ended and OPD withdrew as counsel for the witness before the actual conflict arose. As such, no retrial was necessary. However, defendant's extended sentences, imposed by the trial court, violated his constitutional right to a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner applied for a writ of certiorari, challenging a judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals of Hawai'i that affirmed her sentence and arguing that the appellate court adopted a new, erroneous interpretation of Haw.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On a review, the court held that imposing a prison sentence consecutively to any sentence of a prior conviction pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-606.5(5), including the lesser of such sentences, was a novel but accurate view of the statute. Because the nature of consecutive sentences, whether imposed pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-668.5 (2008) or pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-606.5 (Supp. 2006), was the same, implicit in the exercise of judicial discretion to impose a consecutive sentence under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-606.5 must be consideration of the factors used in governing sentencing discretion under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-668.5. The requirement that a court consider the Haw. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that Haw. Fam. Ct. R. 60(b)(6) was a proper vehicle through which the mother could assert her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and that the right to the assistance of counsel in proceedings for the termination of parental rights included the right to the effective assistance. However, the family court did not abuse its discretion in denying the mother's motion for relief under Haw. Fam. Ct. R. 60(b)(6) because the mother failed to identify any specific error or omission on the part of counsel during the proceedings. Likewise, the family court did not abuse its discretion in denying the mother's motion with regard to the post-termination proceedings because, although the record established that the mother did not receive effective assistance of counsel with regard to her appeal in that no appeal was filed, the mother waited nearly two years after her parental rights were terminated to seek relief. A delay of that magnitude in determining permanent custodial status had a substantial negative impact on the interests of the child, which was a significant factor weighing against the granting of relief.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court concluded that health benefit plans offered to the retirees were constitutionally protected and that the state was required to provide them with health benefit plans that were the same or similar to those offered to active employees. On review, the court held that health benefits for retirees that were included in a health benefits plan constituted an accrued benefit that arose from the retirees' membership in the State employee retirement system and, as such, were protected under Haw. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 2. However, while health care benefits were constitutionally protected, the State was not required by Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 87A to provide retirees with health benefit plans that were the same or similar to those provided to active employees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner owners brought an action in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit, Hawai'i, claiming that a vote taken by the Board of Directors (Board) of respondent homeowners' association did not validly approve a pricing policy at which the association would sell its leased fee interests to its members and violated the association's by-laws. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the association. The owners petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the Intermediate Court of Appeal (ICA) held that the Board validly approved the pricing policy, that neither the association's by-laws nor Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 514C prevented making a profit on the purchase of the fee interests, and the court did not err in awarding attorneys fees and costs. The supreme court noted that under the by-laws, a majority of the seven directors present at the January 30, 2004 meeting, or four directors, was required to vote in favor of the pricing policy in order for it to pass. As only three directors voted in favor of it, the policy did not validly pass. Summary judgment should have been entered in favor of the owners on the pricing policy vote. The circuit court's unchallenged conclusion that the owners were estopped from challenging the adoption of the pricing policy was binding on the supreme court. Although the pricing policy vote violated the association's by-laws, the by-laws themselves complied with Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 514A-82(a)(16) and the voting method utilized by the Board was permitted in Robert's Rules of Order. Estoppel would not allow the Board to violate &sect; 514A-82(a)(16) or frustrate the policy embodied in Chapter 514A.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was initially stopped for a traffic offense. The stop led to the discovery of drugs on defendant's person and in defendant's vehicle.

On appeal, defendant argued that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress. The supreme court's analysis was conducted under Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The intermediate appellate court failed to apply case law requiring that a temporary investigative detention must be reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the detention in the first place. In this case, after the traffic stop occurred, another police officer proceeded to the scene of the traffic stop to investigate defendant for possible drug dealing, not the traffic offenses. The officer's investigation for drug involvement constituted a separate, distinct, and unrelated investigation, which was unsupported by reasonable suspicion; therefore, it was unconstitutional. The intermediate appellate court erred in affirming denial of defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee suffered a work-related injury and was given a permanent partial disability (PPD) of his right great toe.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 386-32(a). The appellate court gave guidance on how to interpret Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386-93(b), which rendered that portion of the opinion advisory because the issue of attorney's fees and costs was not ripe for decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant environmental groups sought review of an order from the Second Circuit Court (Hawaii), which granted a motion for dissolution of an injunction and vacated an order to void an operating agreement in an action challenging the implementation of the Hawaii Superferry project. Appellees, the Hawaii Department of Transportation (DOT), DOT officials, and a ferry company, challenged an award of costs and attorney fees to the groups.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Hawaii Superferry project involved an inter-island ferry service. The trial court granted the groups' request to permanently enjoin appellees from implementing the project at Kahului Harbor while an environmental assessment (EA) was being prepared. Shortly thereafter, Act 2, 2007 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 2, &sect;&sect; 1-18, was enacted. The purpose of Act 2 was to facilitate the establishment of inter-island ferry service without requiring an EA as a condition precedent to the construction of any improvements at Kahului harbor. The trial court granted appellees' motions to dissolve the injunction. On appeal, the court held that Act 2 was unconstitutional as it exercised legislative power over lands owned by the state with a special law. Act 2 violated Haw. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5. Act 2 created a class that was logically and factually limited to a class of one and was, therefore, illusory. Act 2's maximum viability of 21 months limited its benefits to the Superferry, as no other ferry vessel company could realistically enter the market during that time. The trial court did not err in relying on the private attorney general doctrine as a basis for its award of attorney fees against appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment dissolving the injunction and vacating the order to void the operating agreement. The court affirmed in part the order awarding attorney fees to the groups against the DOT and the ferry company based on the private attorney general doctrine. The court reduced costs awarded to the groups by excluding costs related to the operation of a law practice. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that 2d Spec. Sess. 2007 Haw. Sess.

Act 2 was a special law because it created a class that was limited to the instant ferry operator and therefore was illusory, as it was not reasonably probable that other members could join the class in the future, as &sect; 18 of Act 2 repealed it within 21 months, &sect; 8 of Act 2 restricted the benefits of Act 2's alternative environmental review process to considering the impacts of operating a single large capacity ferry vessel company, and &sect; 13 of Act 2 made it clear that Act 2's class of &quot;large capacity ferry vessel company&quot; did not anticipate the addition of future class members and it was conceived, cut, and tailored for the instant ferry operator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Third Circuit Court (Hawai'i) dismissed a first condemnation suit in favor of defendant condemnee and granted a second condemnation suit in favor of plaintiff condemnor. Third party defendant development company was joined as an indispensable party. The condemnee appealed the second condemnation judgment and the denial of a post-judgment motion for statutory damages relating to the first condemnation, under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 101-27 (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The condemnation related to the construction of a subdivision and a bypass as a means of accessing the new development. The first suit was invalid because the condemnor illegally delegated its power of condemnation to the developer and did not have a proper public purpose. The court agreed that the condemnee was entitled to statutory damages, under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 101-27 (1993), as the prevailing party in the first suit because the fact that the property was ultimately condemned in a second condemnation suit, which was consolidated under Haw. R. Civ. P. 42 (2008), was not relevant to the issue of damages in the first suit. The pendency of the first condemnation suit did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction over the second suit, the consolidation did not merge the two suits, and the second suit was not abated by the first because the land was different by approximately 20 percent. For the second condemnation suit, the court held that the condemnor presented sufficient prima facie evidence of public purpose under the rational relationship test. However, the court remanded for consideration of whether the condemnor's asserted public purpose was pretextual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the judgment on the first condemnation for payment of statutory damages to the condemnee.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the governor, two directors, and the insurance commissioner, filed a writ of certiorari seeking review of a judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals of Hawai'i, which affirmed a judgment of a circuit court that was entered in favor plaintiff insurers' council and concluded that the regulatory assessments imposed by the insurance commissioner pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 431:2-215 (Supp. 1999) were unconstitutional taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurance commissioner collected assessments from insurers, which were deposited into the compliance resolution fund (CRF). The insurers' council sued defendants, seeking to enjoin a transfer of $ 2 million from the CRF to the general fund on the ground that the transfer converted the assessments into an illegal and unconstitutional tax and alleged that the assessments imposed by &sect; 431:2-215 were unconstitutional taxes. On appeal, the court held that the insurance commission's assessments were not unconstitutional when they were initially imposed because they were regulatory fees, as: (1) the insurance commissioner was vested with the authority to enforce the Insurance Code; (2) the assessments were placed in a special fund, namely the CRF; and (3) the assessments used to pay overhead and a reserve fund were used to reimburse the insurance division for regulating the insurance industry. However, the transfer of $ 3.5 million from the CRF to the general fund was unconstitutional under the separation of powers doctrine because the transfer made the funds available for general purposes, as if they were derived from general tax revenues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed insofar as it held that the insurance commissioner's assessments were unconstitutional when they were initially imposed but was affirmed insofar as it held that the legislature's transfer of $ 3.5 million of those funds into the general fund was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State petitioned to seize fishing boats used for the illegal taking of stony coral and live rocks in violation of Haw.

The State appealed, and the appellate court vacated the order. On review, the court rejected the property owners' contention that the appellate court lacked jurisdiction because the State did not file its notice of appeal within 30 days of the circuit court's decision as required by Haw. R. App. P. 4(a)(1). An appeal could be taken only after the decision was reduced to a written judgment that was entered by the circuit court. Although a significant amount of time had passed since the circuit court ruled on the motion, the notice of appeal was nevertheless filed within 30 days of the entry of the written judgment. However, the appellate court erred in vacating the order of dismissal. Violations of Haw. Admin. R. 13-95-70 and 13-95-71 were not covered offenses within the meaning of Haw. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father argued, inter alia, that the intermediate court of appeals erred by dismissing the appeal as moot because the &quot;collateral consequences&quot; exception to the mootness doctrine applied. The supreme court agreed, and adopted the collateral consequences doctrine. Being the subject of a court order intended to prevent or stop domestic violence could cause harm to the reputation and legal record of the father. The TRO was issued by the family court based upon its express ruling that &quot;the father did physically harm, injure or assault the minor.&quot; Such ruling implied that the father was a child abuser and was, therefore, &quot;potentially dangerous, thereby undermining his reputation and standing in the community.&quot; The issuance of the TRO could have adversely affected the father's &quot;personal and professional life, employability, associations with neighbors, and choice of housing.&quot; Accordingly, there was a &quot;reasonable possibility&quot; that the issuance of the TRO, which was based upon findings and conclusions that the father abused his daughter, would cause harm to the father's reputation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon resentencing defendant for robbery, the First Circuit Court, Hawai'i, submitted the following reserved question to the state supreme court: May the trial court, as part of a sentencing proceeding under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-662(1), empanel a jury to make a factual finding as to whether the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's commitment for an extended term of incarceration is necessary for public protection?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury of robbery in the first degree, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 708-840(1)(b)(ii) (Supp. 1998), and unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 708-836 (Supp. 1999). The prosecution filed motions for an extended term of imprisonment of life with the possibility of parole, pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect;&sect; 706-661, 706-662(1), and 706-662(4)(a) (Supp. 1996). The prosecution was not required to allege in the complaint that defendant was a persistent offender, because the federal indictment rule did not apply. The Supreme Court of Hawai'i announced a new rule subject only to prospective application and held that factual enhancers to support an extended term of imprisonment must be alleged in the indictment. The circuit court could empanel a jury for the determination of the necessary findings pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 706-661, 706-662, and 706-664. Application of Act 1 to defendant's case would not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto measures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question was answered in the affirmative, and the case was remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court determined that appellants waived their assertion that Hawaii's signatory requirements were unconstitutional because they presented no argument in support of this point of error. The supreme court also determined that the CEO's interpretation and application of the signatory requirements was not clearly erroneous because, inter alia, the CEO properly rejected a large number of signatures as illegible and the regulatory framework did not compel the CEO to cross-reference a signatory's address or date of birth to the information within the statewide voter registration system. Appellants' due process rights were not violated when the CEO presided over the hearing, because they received a fair administrative hearing and failed to show that the CEO had a direct, personal, pecuniary interest in his exercise of judicial power.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the district court properly ruled that the administration of the sobriety tests after the accident went to the weight of the evidence and did not bar the evidence because the officers opined that the accident affected the driver's test performance but that she did not present evidence of her theory that drivers who participated in sobriety tests after being involved in a major accident would most certainly fail.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a child's grandfather and father, sued defendants, the State and the department of human services (DHS), the child's mother, and her boyfriend, for negligence in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Hawai'i). The action arose from suspected child abuse by the mother and boyfriend and the investigation by DHS. The trial court found for plaintiffs and awarded damages. The case was transferred to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">DHS relied on the private analog exception of the State Tort Liability Act, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 662-2 (1993), to argue that it was immune from plaintiffs' action. Section 662-2 was inapplicable, though, because plaintiffs' factual allegations satisfied the elements of a negligence claim against DHS comparable to such a claim against a private person. DHS had a statutory duty under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 587-1 and 587-21 (2006), to protect the child from further abuse. The trial court, while erroneously announcing the application of the Youngberg professional judgment standard of care, properly applied the reasonable person standard of care and ruled that DHS breached its duty to protect the child. In so ruling, the trial court did not err in recognizing the collateral estoppel effect of the family court's oral ruling concerning the child's custody at the time of her April 16, 2001, injuries, and the trial court did not err in finding that the breach of duty by DHS was causally connected to those injuries. Also, the trial court properly found DHS was liable to the plaintiffs for negligent infliction of emotional distress and jointly and severally liable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for stealing $ 10 from the first victim, repeatedly stabbing the second victim, and punching and kicking the third victim. During his trial, an incident defendant was involved in, concerning a van being parked in his parking space in the  apartment building's parking lot, that did not result in any charges was admitted into evidence. The appellate court held that the trial court correctly categorized the apartment incident as part of the res gestae of the charged offenses, rendering it admissible as an exception to Haw. R. Evid. 404(b). On appeal, the court held that the use of res gestae as an independent basis for the admission of evidence was to be abandoned following the passage of Hawaii's Rules of Evidence. The court further held that the incident was not admissible under Rule 404(b) because it was not sufficiently similar to the subsequent crimes to be probative of defendant's intent to commit the charged offenses nor could it have shown defendant's intent to commit the charged offenses, given that the incident and the subsequent crimes were unrelated and lacked any nexus to each other.

R. Civ. P. 54(b), in plaintiffs' action seeking an injunction prohibiting defendants from selling or transferring ceded lands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sought an injunction against defendants, arguing that sales of ceded lands would constitute a breach of trust the State owed to native Hawaiians who had claims to those lands under the Joint Resolution to Acknowledge the 100th Anniversary of the January 17, 1893 Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Public Law No. 103-150, 107 Stat. 1510 (1993). On appeal, the court held that, contrary to the trial court's findings, plaintiffs' claims were not barred by sovereign immunity, waiver, or estoppel, and that the case did not involve a political question and was ripe for consideration. The court held that plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction prohibiting the sale or transfer of ceded lands because the Resolution and related state legislation, including 1993 Haw. Sess. Laws 354, 359, gave rise to the State's fiduciary duty to preserve the corpus of the public lands trust, specifically the ceded lands, until such time as the unrelinquished claims of the native Hawaiians had been resolved. Without an injunction, any ceded lands alienated from the public lands trust would be lost and would not be available for the future reconciliation efforts contemplated by the Resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was vacated and the case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to issue an order granting plaintiffs an injunction prohibiting defendants from selling or transferring to third parties the parcel of ceded land on Maui and any ceded lands from the public lands trust until the claims of the native Hawaiians on those lands has been resolved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the OIP contended the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the franchise because the franchise was an agency under the Hawaii Uniform Information Practices Act (UIPA), Haw.

The appellate court disagreed, finding first that because the legislature defined &quot;agency&quot; in the UIPA, the OIP's determination that the franchise was an agency subject to the UIPA was not entitled to the deferential abuse of discretion standard on review. Further, the application of the undisputed facts to the statutory definition of &quot;agency&quot; established as a matter of law that the franchise was not an agency within the purview of the UIPA as: it was not &quot;owned&quot; by the State; the State did not operate the franchise; the State did not control, direct, administer, take charge of, or exercise skill or judgment over the franchise's activities or business affairs; the State did not &quot;manage&quot; the franchise; and the franchise did not perform a government function on behalf of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grandparents petitioned for visitation with their grandchild. The family court dismissed the petition on the ground that &sect; 571-46.3 was unconstitutional on its face in light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Troxell v. Granville. On appeal, the court held that even though the transfer of custody of the child to the father destroyed the controversy created by the grandparents' petition for visitation, the appeal was not rendered moot in light of the public interest exception. The court held that &sect; 571-46.3 was not facially unconstitutional in light of Troxell because the best interests of the child standard in &sect;&nbsp;571-46.3 required the family court to give special weight to the visitation decisions of a custodial parent whose fitness had not been challenged, and such a conclusion comported with the limited requirements expressed in Troxell. However, the court held because a &quot;harm to the child&quot; standard for the denial of nonparent third party visitation was constitutionally required under the due process clause and could not be read into &sect; 571-46.3 without making a substantive amendment to the statute,&nbsp;&sect; 571-46.3, as written, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The questions presented by the park attendee were whether the ICA gravely erred in concluding (1) that the camping ordinance and rule were not unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, and (2) that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 702-213(1) was applicable to a camping charge. The supreme court concluded that the camping regulation would appear void because it would subject innocent, constitutionally protected behavior as well as conduct which may be validly regulated. In effect, the standard vested virtually complete discretion in the hands of the police to determine whether a person had violated the regulation. The supreme court was not bound by the decisions of other courts insofar as greater protection may be afforded under Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 The limitless net cast would seemingly reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct under the Hawai'i Constitution.

The obligation of the insured to compensate the physician for medical services rendered did not pre-exist the insurance contract.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 709-906(1), (7) (Supp. 2006). Defendant petitioned for review under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 602-59 (Supp. 2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for pushing, grabbing, and scratching his estranged wife. During the trial, defense counsel stipulated to defendant's prior abuse convictions. On review, the court held that pursuant to the definition of &quot;element&quot; set forth in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 702-205, the prior conviction reference in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 709-906(7) constituted an element of the offense of the abuse charge. The court further held that because the family court did not engage defendant in a colloquy regarding waiving proof of an element of the charge, namely his prior convictions, his conviction had to be vacated and the case remanded for a new trial. The court further held that the family court abused its discretion when it denied defendant's request to prohibit the State from informing the jury of the nature of the prior convictions to which defendant had stipulated. The error was compounded by the failure to instruct the jury that the stipulation could be used only to prove the prior conviction element of the offense and was not otherwise to be considered in relation to the instant offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On petition for a writ of certiorari, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the instant court, which affirmed defendant's extended terms of imprisonment, and ordered that the instant court reconsider defendant's appeal in light of Cunningham v. California.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of 22 felonies alleged in five separate indictments, including one count of attempted second degree murder. The instant court concluded that defendant's extended term sentences imposed by the circuit court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and were illegal. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Cunningham v. California eliminated the role of the sentencing judge in finding facts necessary for the imposition of an extended term of imprisonment outside the maximum authorized solely by the jury's verdict. Inasmuch as Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-662, in all of its manifestations, authorized the sentencing court to extend defendant's sentence beyond the standard term authorized solely by the jury's verdict by requiring the sentencing court, rather than the trier of fact, to make an additional necessity finding that did not fall under Apprendi's prior-or-concurrent-convictions exception, the instant court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional on its face. Moreover, similar constitutional infirmities infected the statute as a whole, to the extent that each subsection required the sentencing court to make the offending necessity finding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The instant court vacated the judgments and sentences of the circuit court and remanded the matter to the circuit court for non-extended term sentencing, but it declined to exercise its inherent power to order, on remand, that a new jury be impaneled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Hawaii Department of Transportation (DOT), sought review of an order from the Third Circuit Court (Hawaii), which awarded judgment to appellee in an action challenging the revocation of appellee's motor vehicle inspection certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee conducted vehicle safety inspections. The DOT later revoked her inspector certificate. The DOT based the revocation upon 75 incidents in which she failed to conduct required inspections of vehicle components during the inspection of 18 vehicles. The Director of the DOT upheld the revocation. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court found that the revocation of appellee's license was civil, rather than criminal, in nature. Appellee failed to establish any prejudice to her substantial rights, as required by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 91-14(g) (1993). The DOT's harmonization of the inspection procedures with Haw. Admin. R. &sect; 19-133.2-40 (1994) achieved the underlying purpose of the motor vehicle inspection program and was not so vague as to be substantially incomprehensible or so vague and indefinite as really to be no rule or standard at all. The DOT's inspection procedures and &sect; 19-133.2-40 were not unconstitutionally vague. The DOT's decision was not unjust and unreasonable in its consequences, but, rather, was supported by evidence in the record and was based upon a valid interpretation of the rules as applied to appellee's conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Insofar as the prosecution against defendant began on June 30, 2004, with the filing of the complaint, the circuit court was obligated by the language of 2004 Haw. Sess. L. Act 44, &sect; 29, to apply the 2002 version of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-606.5 to her case. Moreover, because defendant conceded her status as a repeat offender under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-606.5 by conceding the existence of an applicable prior conviction of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle, the circuit court could not sentence her to probation. Rather, the circuit court was required to apply Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-606.5 to sentence defendant to a mandatory minimum sentence of one year and eight months.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer noticed a marijuana pipe in defendant's home, and he was arrested. He was convicted, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court held that defendant's argument regarding his right to privacy was not preserved for appellate review because it was not raised before the trial court. Next, the enforcement of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1249 did not violate defendant's First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion. The standard enunciated in the Smith case controlled in this case. Under that standard, governmental regulations of general applicability were immune from claims or defenses raised under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment under some circumstances. Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1249 was a neutral law of general applicability, and it did not interfere with other constitutional rights. It did not create a mechanism for governmental assessment of individual applicants for exemptions. This was not type of hybrid rights situation that merited a strict scrutiny analysis. Therefore, the First Amendment was not a viable defense to the charge. Lastly, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000bb-1, did not apply to the states.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that, under the United States Supreme Court's decisions in the Crawford and Davis cases, the trial court did not err by admitting into evidence a statement that the victim made to a police officer concerning defendant's assault on her because the victim testified at trial and was cross-examined. Even though the victim claimed on direct examination that she did not remember the incident or the statement she gave to the officer, on cross-examination she willingly and informatively responded to virtually all of the questions posed by defense counsel. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because the evidence indicated that: (1) the victim, defendant, and a friend were present; (2) the landlord heard slapping noises and a &quot;hard thug;&quot; (3) the responding police officers observed that the victim had sustained injuries to her face and right shoulder; and (4) despite exhibiting some degree of memory loss at trial, the victim had earlier reported to the officer that defendant approached her from behind, held her neck against the couch, and punched her on the left side of her face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty in the First Circuit Court (Hawai'i) to promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree, unlawful use of drug paraphernalia, prostitution, and other drug offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that the circuit court imposed an illegal sentence in sentencing defendant to probation, inasmuch as, in light of an undisputed prior conviction, she was a repeat offender and, therefore, should have been sentenced pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-606.5 (Supp. 1999). The supreme court agreed. &quot;Proceedings&quot; meant criminal prosecutions of which sentencing hearings were an inseparable component. Because defendant was charged on January 5 and April 13, 2004, prior to the effective date of 2004 Haw. Sess. L. Act 44 of July 1, 2004, the circuit court erred in applying the Act's ameliorative amendments to her sentence. Furthermore, and insofar as defendant conceded that she qualified as a repeat offender under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-606.5 in light of a prior conviction of unauthorized control of a vehicle, the circuit court could not sentence defendant to probation pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-622.5 (Supp. 2002), the first-time drug offender statute in effect at the time of the commission of her offenses. Rather, the circuit court was required to apply Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-606.5 to sentence defendant to a mandatory minimum sentence of one year and eight months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment sentencing defendant to probation was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing as a repeat offender, pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-606.5 (Supp. 1999).</SPAN></P>

The First Circuit Court, Hawai'i, granted the county's motion to dismiss and entered final judgment in favor of the county. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents argued, inter alia, that application of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-72 (Supp. 1998) in this case violated the equal protection guarantees contained in the state and federal constitutions. The parents argued that, whereas tort claimants against private parties or the state derived the benefit of a two-year limitation period, they and other plaintiffs allegedly injured by a county were subject to a more restrictive six-month limitation for which no rational basis existed. The court concluded that there was no rational basis for the classification scheme effectuated by &sect; 46-72 as it read in 2004. The county offered no rationale for the distinction between the two classes, nor could the court deduce one. This constitutional error was cured by severing the statute's (since repealed) six-month limitation provision, thereby relegating any claims made pursuant to &sect; 46-72 to the same two-year limitation applicable to claims against private tortfeasors under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 657-7 (1993). Inasmuch as the parents filed their complaint within two years after the cause of action accrued, they were entitled to pursue their claims against the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustees or intervenors proposed and the voters approved the amendment, which decreased and limited real property taxes for County residents. The County's declaratory judgment action alleged that the amendment usurped the County Council's taxing authority. The court affirmed summary judgment for the County on the ground that the amendment violated Haw. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 because it usurped the County government's or Council's functions, powers, and duties relating to the taxation of real property. &quot;The counties&quot; referred to in Haw. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 were the county or local governments or the county councils. The court held that the circuit court properly denied the trustees' motion to dismiss because Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 603-21.5 (Supp. 2004) provided an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction and, after the dismissal of the Council as a dispensable defendant, the County, acting on the Council's behalf, had standing. The court reversed the ruling that the amendment violated the RCCK because it was properly initiated and enacted and its cap provision was proper charter material in that it operated as a limitation on the legislative body's power to raise revenue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment that the amendment violated the RCCK. The court affirmed the judgment in all other respects. The court dismissed the County Council as a dispensable defendant.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 480-1. The court reversed the grant of SJ to the developer on an implied warranty of habitability claim because it did not provide a disclosure abstract stating that no warranties existed under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 514A-61(c). The court reversed the grant of SJ to all defendants on the ground that the negligence claims were barred by the statute of limitations in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 657-7 because genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the association, through reasonable diligence, should have discovered that the cracks were caused by a defect more than two years before filing the action.

Sess. Laws. 100, which amended Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 88-107 (Supp. 2006), unconstitutionally diverted money from the Employees' Retirement System of the State of Hawai'i (ERS).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Act 100 retroactively reduced the amounts the State and counties contributed to the ERS by crediting actuarial investment earnings in excess of 10% of the actuarial investment yield rate toward contributions. The State was granted summary judgment on the claims of the ERS members and trustees that Act 100 was unconstitutional. The court remanded the case for dismissal of the members' claims for lack of standing because they failed to allege that they received any pension benefit to which they were entitled and suffered an actual or threatened injury. The court held that the trustees had standing as fiduciaries and were entitled to a declaratory judgment under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632-1 (1993) that Act 100 violated Haw. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 2, which was patterned after the New York system, because Act 100 retroactively divested the ERS of contributions, eliminated the sources used to fund constitutionally protected &quot;accrued benefits,&quot; and undermined the retirement system's continuing security and integrity. The court found unpersuasive the State's arguments of ripeness, mootness, the political question doctrine, sovereign immunity, and the Haw. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the judgment against the members with instructions to enter an order dismissing their claim for lack of jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued on appeal that the district court erred in sentencing him as a repeat offender because nine days after his instant DUI arrest but before his conviction and sentencing, his prior DUI conviction was reversed. Defendant failed to preserve his due process argument for review, and therefore it was reviewed for plain error, because he failed to invoke, either in brief or in oral argument, the protections of either the United States or Hawaii Constitutions. The court held that the language set forth in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 291E-61(c) (2003) manifested a clear legislative intent to create a status offense in &sect; 291E-61 and therefore it was not a violation of defendant's due process rights to sentence him as a second-time offender based on his prior conviction, which was valid at the time of his arrest for the instant offense. However, because the complaint did not allege defendant's prior conviction, it was insufficient to charge him with a violation of &sect; 291E-61(a), (b)(2) as a second-time offender. The complaint was sufficient to charge defendant with DUI as a first offense, as defendant impliedly acknowledged.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court found that a plaintiff that sought a judicial declaration as to the validity of an agency rule, pursuant to &sect; 91-7, had to reside or have its principal place of business in the county in which the adjudicating circuit court sat; initiating a &sect; 91-7 action in the wrong circuit was a defect of jurisdiction that mandated dismissal. Because the provider resided in the fifth judicial circuit its complaint was improperly filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i) that granted summary judgment in favor of defendant, the prosecuting attorney for the City and County of Honolulu, in a suit over the legality of the prosecutor's use of public funds and other public resources to advocate in a state-wide general election for passage of an amendment to the Hawai'i Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecutor favored a &quot;direct filing&quot; bill and campaigned extensively to promote it in various ways, including the expenditure of public resources and utilization of employees in his office in that effort. The taxpayer argued, inter alia, that the circuit court erred by granting summary judgment to the prosecutor because his use of public funds and resources to advocate for a particular election result was not authorized by state law. The supreme court agreed. The language in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-10.6 was specifically directed to the department of the attorney general, and its duties with respect to crime research, prevention, and education. There was no mention of a city or county prosecutor in the statute. The prosecutor's conduct went far beyond providing information to the public on how the criminal justice system could be improved; he became a partisan advocate leading a campaign using public funds and other resources to tell voters how to vote. It could not be seriously contended that the legislature intended to vest the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney of the City and County of Honolulu with the same powers as were granted to the state attorney general in &sect; 28-10.6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was vacated and the case was remanded to the circuit court with instructions to grant the taxpayer's motion for summary judgment on his declaratory judgment claim that the prosecutor acted without legal authority when he used public funds and resources to advocate for a proposed constitutional amendment in a general election.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The evidence demonstrated that defendant agreed to give an undercover police officer a &quot;handjob&quot; for a fee of $ 20. The officer confirmed with defendant that the charge for the massage &quot;out-call&quot; was $ 100. The officer then asked whether &quot;that cost extra,&quot; and according to the officer, defendant answered, &quot;add $ 20.&quot; The officer testified that he confirmed, &quot;oh, $ 20 for handjob,&quot; and defendant replied, &quot;yes.&quot; That testimony indicated that the $ 20 added fee was for the handjob. Defendant also testified that she knew that the term &quot;handjob&quot; could mean assisted masturbation. The meaning of &quot;sexual contact&quot; in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1200(1) included &quot;any touching of the sexual parts of a person.&quot; Plainly, the reference to &quot;hand&quot; in the term &quot;handjob&quot; connoted physical contact with genitals. Hence, considered in the strongest light for the prosecution, substantial evidence was adduced that enabled a person of reasonable caution to conclude that defendant agreed to engage in sexual contact with the officer for a fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grandmother and the son contended Haw. Fam. Ct. R. 65(b) violated due process and former Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 560:5-101(2), purporting to define &quot;incapacitated person,&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. The supreme court disagreed, finding no merit to the grandmother's and the son's condemnation of Haw. Fam. Ct. R. 65 as unconstitutional merely because that Rule employed different language than Haw. R. Civ. P. 65(b). And because due process was flexible and called for procedural protections as the particular situation demanded, and because Haw. Fam. Ct. R. 65 afforded a reasonable time for those interested to make their appearance, the Rule on its face satisfied the constitutional requirements. Further, the grandmother and the son had ample notice of the pendency of the proceedings and numerous opportunities to be heard and to resolve the TRO. The definition of incapacitated person under former Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 560:5-101(2) sufficiently apprised the grandmother of the bases on which the trial court would review the guardianship petition and any ambiguity in the statute did not render it substantially incomprehensible so as to overcome the presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The stop was not supported by a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was engaged in criminal conduct as the officer did not observe a suspicious driving pattern as defendant's vehicle approached the checkpoint or that defendant's turn was effected in an illegal manner. The officer testified that he did not observe any traffic violations prior to the stop and that the sole reason for stopping defendant's vehicle was because he believed that defendant was avoiding the checkpoint. The &quot;chase car&quot; police procedure of stopping all vehicles that lawfully turned onto a public way in advance of the checkpoint exceeded the authority granted to the police to establish roadblocks under by Haw.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was employed by the Hawai'i Youth Correctional Facility (HYCF). He was charged with and convicted of grabbing the testicles of a minor who was committed there. In affirming, the supreme court determined that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal under Haw. R. Penal P. 29 (2005) and motion for a new trial under Haw. R. Penal P. 33 (2005) because the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The HYCF was a state correctional facility based on Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 352-2.1(a) (1993), and the victim was imprisoned there. The supreme court declined to hear the argument that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-732 was unconstitutional based on the fact that there was no element requiring sexual purpose, gratification, or intent. Even if it had been considered, the argument lacked merit. The differences between the definitions of &quot;sexual contact&quot; in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-700 and Alaska Stat. &sect;&nbsp;11.81.900(b)(58) did not render Haw. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated proceeding, appellant claimant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Hawaii) granting the motion to dismiss or for summary judgment filed by appellees, an employer and an insurer, and review of a decision of the Hawaii Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB), which, in part, ordered suspension of the claimant's workers' compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (DLIR) awarded the claimant work-related benefits, the employer and the insurer initiated a second proceeding with the DLIR to revoke the claimant's benefits pursuant to Haw.

The DLIR found that the claimant had violated &sect; 386-98 and assessed administrative penalties against the claimant, and the LIRAB affirmed. To the extent that the claimant sought a writ of mandamus, the court did not have jurisdiction because the claimant did not comply with the filing requirements set forth in Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 602-5(8) (1993), Haw. R. App. P. 17, and Haw. R. App. P. 21.

However, it was error to use the preponderance of the evidence standard under Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 91-10(5). The alleged fraud under Haw. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the department of human resources (DHS), the State, and others, appealed a decision of the First Circuit Court (Hawai'i) in plaintiff blind vendors' action alleging that DHS failed to enforce Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 102-14 (Supp. 2005) and 347-12.5 (1993) and the implementing regulation of the Hawai'i Randolph-Sheppard Act (RSA) as against defendants, a city and a county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The vendors sought declaratory, monetary and equitable relief claiming that the State defendants were required to insure that vending machine income generated from state and county operations be paid into the Randolph-Sheppard revolving (RSR) account. The court reversed, and held that by becoming a state licensing agency under the federal RSA, and participating in the RSA program, Hawai'i agreed to comply with the federal adjudication path for its blind vendors' grievances. The evidence that Congress conditioned state participation in the Randolph-Sheppard program on consent to federal judicial enforcement of compensatory awards was overwhelming. Hawaii's statute acknowledged its acceptance of the federal RSA program and set out regulations, to the extent permitted by the federal RSA, that were applicable to federal, as well as state and county, properties. Based on an examination of the overall scheme of the federal RSA and its relationship to the Hawaii RSA, as well as federal case law, inasmuch as the federal adjudication path applied to disputes arising from the Hawaii RSA, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide the merits of the instant case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff commercial catamaran operator sued defendant State, agency, and officials in state court for recovery of tonnage fees after a federal district court determined the ocean recreation management area permit fees to be unconstitutionally assessed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although plaintiff correctly argued that the ocean recreation management area permit fees were not taxes of any kind, the circuit court properly held, albeit for the wrong reasons, that it was divested of jurisdiction because of plaintiff's failure to seek relief under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-35. Section 40-35, when read together with its legislative history, clearly encompassed the disputed fees in issue such that it was the statute under which relief had to be sought. On account of this alternate remedy at law, the circuit court properly found plaintiff's tort claims barred under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 662-15(3). Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 661-1 was inapplicable because the ocean recreation management area permit under which fees were due was a revocable license, rather than a contract. Finally, plaintiff had not filed a claim pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-35 within the 30-day statute of limitations, such that any claim made thereunder was time-barred. Thus, although the appellate court was not unmindful of the ostensible inequity visited upon plaintiff, it was nevertheless compelled to affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The granddaughter had initiated proceedings because of concern that the mother was incompetent and was not being properly cared for.

The court appointed a doctor in Panama to conduct an IME. When the mother did not appear for the IME, the family court issued an order for sanctions and for attorney's fees to the granddaughter. The court held that the TRO was properly before the family court pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 560:5-309. The parties had notice of the proceedings and the service requirements of Haw. Fam. Ct. R. 4(d)(3)(B) were not applicable. The family court had subject matter jurisdiction to issue the TRO, in part, to the authority conferred upon the court under Haw. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-31, was unconstitutional. The court held that the candidate's election complaint was timely filed because the 6-day limit in Haw, Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-173.5(a) was mandatory and the 4:30 p.m. requirement was directory. However, the court held that the complaint failed to establish that irregularities would have change the outcome of the election, as required by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-172. The court noted that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-31 had not been ruled unconstitutional by any court, and that the failure of other candidates to abide by campaign spending limits did not demonstrate that the results of the election would have been changed. The court concluded that the candidate was not entitled to an injunction because the only remedy provided by Haw. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to an amendment to &sect; 78-13, the June 30, 1998 pay day would be delayed by one day to July 1, 1998 resulting in one regular paycheck being issued in June 1998 and a total of 23 paychecks, instead of the usual 24, in 1998. The members initially challenged the amended statute in federal court, and after the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the faculty and the State expired, the federal case was dismissed.  The court held that the collateral estoppel doctrine was inapplicable. Also, the amendment authorized the governor to convert the existing predicted payroll system to an after-the-fact payroll system by gradually delaying each paycheck until the pay dates fell on the fifth and the twentieth of the month. The amendment did not violate Haw. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2 nor Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 89. However, based upon the legislative history, the court held that the specific implementation dates set forth in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 78-13 were mandatory. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in concluding that the exception from the twice-monthly requirement pertained to a payroll lag imposed in 1998, and was not available to the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i) of, inter alia, theft in the first degree, theft in the second degree, and forgery in the second degree. The convictions involved public funds. The court sentenced defendant to five consecutive ten-year terms of imprisonment. After the court denied defendant's motion for correction or reduction of his sentence, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the circuit court erred by not ordering one of his sentences to run concurrently. The supreme court disagreed. The circuit court acknowledged that the amount of money that defendant stole could be as &quot;little&quot; as $ 1.3 million but implied that the precise amount was immaterial to the sentence it ultimately mandated; the circuit court reasonably placed greater significance on the number of victims and their &quot;innocent bystander&quot; status. Even assuming the number to have been 1.3 million dollars, it was $ 1.3 million that a financially strapped city administration could ill afford to lose at the time. It was a theft of funds from taxpayers, and the victims were numerous. Defendant effected a complicated scheme through the manipulation of others and at the profound and unrecoverable expense of taxpayers. While stern, the circuit court's sentence furthered the penological goals of retribution, incapacitation, and deterrence and did not reflect arbitrary or capricious action or a rigid refusal to consider defendant's contentions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs participated in the Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 674 administrative process, but none received any administrative remedy for their claim. The trial court ruled that the plaintiffs were permitted to pursue their breach of contract claims in the circuit court. The court held that the right-to-sue provision in ch. 674, pt. III was must be strictly construed. Plaintiffs, having received no affirmative legislative action by the notice-filing deadline, acted properly to preserve their rights by timely submitting the required written notice rejecting the legislature's action, i.e., deferral that effectively denied all claims, and filing suit before the corresponding deadline. Consequently, the conditions of the trust review panel's &quot;review&quot; and legislative &quot;action&quot; as set forth in the definition of &quot;aggrieved individual claimant&quot; under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 674-17 were met. Even assuming the review and action requirements of &sect; 674-17 created a statute of repose, those requirements were satisfied such that the State's waiver of sovereign immunity under Haw. Rev.

The petitioner also alleged counsel failed to call certain witnesses, but these witnesses related to the 1995 incident, and they had no personal knowledge. Further, counsel disclosed the intention not to use prior bad acts. Double jeopardy did not apply because the offenses' elements were not the same. Other issues, such as ineffective assistance, were not raised on direct appeal. Finally, &sect; 701-109 was inapplicable as the actions were not continuous.</SPAN></P>

The first attorney requested $ 53,325, while the second attorney requested $ 8,807.50.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs argued that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 607-14.5 (Supp. 2005) authorized the award of fees and costs inasmuch as defendants' arguments in the underlying proceeding were frivolous. The court concluded that because the legal principles addressed in the underlying proceeding were not firmly established, defendants' actions were not frivolous. Therefore, the court declined to award attorney fees pursuant to &sect; 607-14.5. The fact that sovereign immunity did not preclude the court from addressing the merits of the case did not necessarily result in plaintiffs having a right to attorneys' fees. Although plaintiffs argued that an award of fees was appropriate under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-175 (1993) because defendants had violated the same article of the Hawai'i Constitution not once but twice, the court concluded that defendants had not engaged in repeated violations of the same matters under the Hawai'i Constitution. The court granted plaintiffs' request for reimbursement for the costs of printing and copying the briefs and appendices as well as their request for costs of service of process, but it disallowed their request to be reimbursed for the cost of transcripts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of two counts of forgery in the second degree and one count of theft in the second degree. The prosecution filed a motion to sentence him as a multiple offender to extended terms of imprisonment of 10 years, pursuant to &sect;&nbsp;706.662(4)(a), for each of the three Class C felonies of which he was simultaneously convicted. The prosecution also moved to sentence him as a repeat offender to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of one year and eight months pursuant to &sect; 706-606.5(1)(a)(iv) (1993). The trial court granted both motions. The trial court sentenced him to an extended 10-year indeterminate maximum term of imprisonment, subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of one year and eight months. On appeal, the court disagreed with defendant that the Rivera court's acceptance of Blakely's labels, particularly the term &quot;indeterminate&quot;, absent confirmation that Washington's definition of &quot;indeterminate&quot; was the same or nearly the same as Hawaii's, was erroneous and that the &quot;necessary for protection of the public&quot; consideration was qualitatively different as between ordinary and extended-term sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff challenged an order of the First Circuit Court Civ. No. 00-1-3849 (Hawaii) that granted in part defendant's post-judgment motion pursuant to Haw. R. Civ. P. 59 by granting defendant's request to apply the covered loss deductible statute (CLD), Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 431:10C-301.5 (Supp. 2002), to reduce the amount of damages awarded to plaintiff in a Court Annexed Arbitration Program (CAAP) award on his motor vehicle tort claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties were involved in a car accident. Plaintiff filed suit asserting motor vehicle tort claims in Counts I and II, and Count III sought declaratory relief that the CLD statute,&nbsp;&sect; 431:10C-301.5, was unconstitutional. The case was submitted to the CAAP, and plaintiff was awarded damages. Neither party filed a notice of appeal and request for trial de novo; thus the circuit court entered the arbitration award as a final judgment. Defendant filed a post-judgment motion to apply the CLD statute and to dismiss Count III. The circuit court applied the CLD statute and reduced the arbitration award, but did not address defendant's request as to Count III. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that the entry of the CAAP award as a final judgment was &quot;interlocutory&quot; because Count III was not resolved by the arbitrator. The court held that the circuit court erred in applying the CLD statute because once the arbitration award metamorphosed into a final judgment, it was not subject to circuit court modification or review under Haw. R. Civ. P. 59. The court held it was unnecessary to address plaintiff's constitutionality claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant entered a no contest plea on one count of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree, the First District Court, Hawaii, sentenced him to five years in prison, to run concurrently with another sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred by denying his motion to correct illegal sentence because his repeat offender status, on which his one-year mandatory minimum sentence was based, was nullified when his prior conviction for drug-related offenses was vacated as unconstitutionally obtained; and by denying his motion to withdraw his no contest plea due to changed circumstances. The supreme court found that defendant did not dispute the relevant point, namely, that when the officer arrested him, the facts and circumstances known to the officer at that time reasonably gave rise to the belief that defendant was a convicted felon in violation of a condition of probation. No more was required to establish probable cause; that defendant's conviction and probation order was vacated one year later was irrelevant as a matter of law to the analysis of whether probable cause existed at the time of arrest. While the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to correct sentence, the error was moot as he was subsequently reconvicted and resentenced on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant father appealed a judgment of the Family Court of the First Circuit, Hawai'i, establishing him as the father of the child in question, ordering him to pay child support, arrearages, and birth-related expenses, and allocating expenses for the child's future medical expenses equally between the parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father argued that: (1) the Hawai'i Uniform Parentage Act (HUPA) was unconstitutional because it violated his rights to privacy and equal protection under the state and federal constitutions; and (2) insofar as he was an unemployed student, the family court violated his right to be free from compulsory service when it ordered him to pay child support in the amount of 50 dollars per month because he would have been forced to get a part-time job. The instant court concluded that each of the father's arguments was manifestly and palpably without merit. Because the father failed to raise the question of equal protection at trial or in his pretrial legal memoranda, that issue was waived. HUPA did not implicate the father's fundamental privacy right to procreational autonomy, but rather his economic interest in not supporting his child. Because HUPA bore a rational relation to the public welfare, it survived rational basis review, and the father's procreational autonomy and equal protection arguments failed. The father's obligation to financially support his child and to become employed if necessary to meet that obligation was not comparable to peonage or slavery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's constitutional arguments were without merit. The alleged prosecutorial misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court did not err either in its instructions to the jury or in its review of the jury's findings. Considering the evidence presented to the trier of fact regarding the amount and types of injuries sustained by the victim and the reasonable inferences that the jury could draw therefrom, the prosecution presented credible evidence of sufficient quality and probative value in both the 1997 and 2002 proceedings to allow triers of fact of reasonable caution to support the conclusion that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant individuals filed a complaint under the provisions of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632-1 (1993), asking the court to enter a declaratory judgment to the effect that cockfighting was a native Hawaiian customary right protected pursuant to Haw. Const. art. XII, &sect;&nbsp;7 and Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;7-1 (1993). The Second Circuit Court (Hawai'i) granted appellee State's motion to dismiss the complaint. The individuals appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individuals sought a declaratory judgment because of a perceived threat of criminal prosecution. The complaint was filed under the provisions of the Declaratory Judgments Act, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632-1. Of the three factors set forth in Pacific Meat Co., only one arguably existed in the instant case, which was that the ordinance and statute against cockfighting were malum prohibitum. The request for declaratory relief did not involve a continuing course of business nor had there been a criminal prosecution. Therefore, the Supreme Court of Hawai'i held that the instant case lacked the special circumstances akin to Pacific Meat Co., that warranted declarative action. Criminal proceedings were the best forum in which to resolve all of the questions in the instant case. A declarative judgment in favor of the individuals in the instant context would have hindered enforcement of what were presumptively valid laws. Declaratory relief would not ordinarily be employed to determine the enforcement of criminal statutes. The challenges to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 711-1109(1) (2004) and the Maui County, Haw., Code ch. 9.08.010 were not proper subjects for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was vacated and the case was remanded to the court to enter summary judgment in favor of the county on its motion and in favor of the State on its joinder to the county's motion and to enter judgment thereon on the grounds set forth herein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a city and lessees, sought review of a decision First Circuit Court (Hawai'i), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee trustees in the condemnation action initiated by the city to acquire the fee interest in a condominium development to convey fee simple title to the lessees. On the trustees' declaratory action, the trial court found that Honolulu, Haw., Rev. Ordinances ch. 38 as applied was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants argued that the circuit court erred in ruling that there had not continuously been qualified lessees for at least 25 units to support the condemnation action. The court held that the circuit court erred in ruling that lessees one and two were not qualified to participate in condemnation proceedings because neither owned fee simple property suitable for residential purposes within the city at the time they applied to lease the property. However, lessee three was not qualified to participate because he owned property within the city, and &sect; 38-2.4 required that lessees not be owner-occupants in order to participate in condemnation proceedings under ch. 38. Because the court found that Honolulu, Haw., Rules for Residential Condominium Cooperative and Planned Development Leasehold Conversion &sect; 2-14 was inconsistent with Honolulu, Haw., Rev. Ordinances &sect; 38-2.4 and therefore, invalid and that the fourth lessees, absent the rule allowing &quot;tacking,&quot; did not satisfy the requirements of &sect; 38-2.4, they were not qualified. The failure to receive a sufficient number of qualified applications prior to initiating ch. 38 proceedings resulted in an invalid designation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the circuit court's award of summary judgment in favor of the trustees in the condemnation action and remanded the issue of the trustees' request for fees and costs to the circuit court for clarification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Hawai'i) that found him guilty of two counts of third-degree sexual assault in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-732(1)(b) (Supp. 2003) and sentenced him to concurrent five-year prison terms. Defendant's conviction arose from an incident in which he kissed a 9-year-old girl twice, without consent, and forced his tongue into her mouth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that kissing the girl on the lips and placing his tongue into her mouth did not constitute &quot;sexual contact&quot; as defined in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-700 or 712-1210 and that, therefore, the trial court erred in finding him guilty of sexual assault and denying his motion to dismiss the indictment and for judgment of acquittal. The court held that defendant's conduct constituted &quot;sexual contact&quot; under &sect; 707-700 because his contact with the interior of the girl's mouth constituted &quot;touching of intimate parts&quot; of her body as provided in the definition of &quot;sexual contact&quot; in &sect; 707-700 and the act itself had to be considered sexual in nature. The court based its conclusion on the plain language and legislative history of &sect; 707-700 and construed the definition of &quot;sexual contact&quot; with reference to other definitions relating to sexual relations in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 707-700 and 712-1210. The court also held that defendant failed to demonstrate that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-700 was unconstitutionally vague because he failed to establish that a person of ordinary intelligence would not know that such conduct constituted sexual contact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court judgment that convicted and sentenced defendant for sexual assault of conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Third Circuit Court (Hawaii) denied defendant's motion to dismiss, he was convicted of commercial promotion of marijuana in the second degree, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1249.5 (1)(c) (1993), and prohibited acts relating to drug paraphernalia, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 329-43.5(a) (1993). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police seized from defendant's residence 82 marijuana plants and paraphernalia used to smoke and grow marijuana. He filed a motion to dismiss on grounds that (1) Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1240.1 provided a complete defense, as defendant had a prescription to use marijuana; and (2) the prosecution excluded &quot;clearly exculpatory&quot; evidence from the grand jury. The supreme court held that the trial court properly denied the motion. As defendant's counsel had admitted that marijuana could not be legally prescribed, he was judicially estopped from relying on &sect; 712-1240.1. Cal. Health and Safety Code &sect; 11362.5 (1996), allowing possession of marijuana for medical purposes, did not authorize defendant to possess marijuana in violation of Hawaiian law, but only forbade prosecution under California law. Therefore, evidence relating to defendant's &sect; 11362.5 defense was not &quot;clearly excuplatory.&quot; The trial court did not clearly err in finding that the fact that defendant's religion required him to use cannabis once a year did not justify his possession of over 50 plants and four pipes, and that, accordingly, his free exercise of religion was not burdened by his prosecution under the drug laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A dispute arose concerning the application of Hawaii County, Haw., Charter &sect; 3-17 (1990). After partial summary judgment was granted in favor of the county, an appeal was filed. In affirming, the court determined that the phrase &quot;equal resident populations&quot; in &sect; 3-17(f)(4) excluded nonresident college students and nonresident military personnel and their dependents from the population base for purposes of reapportionment in the county. The court declined to interpret &quot;resident populations&quot; like the definition in Haw. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4 (1992) because it only applied to state legislative redistricting. However, the erroneous inclusion did not result in an unconstitutional deviation under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. First, a rational governmental policy justified a total deviation that slightly exceeded the 10 percent threshold. The total deviation of 10.89 percent was constitutional because the deviation was minimal, it included the consideration of other valid criteria under &sect; 3-17, and it resulted from an intent to achieve inclusiveness and equal representation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim, defendant's cousin, testified that he and defendant got into an argument and defendant shot the victim in the eye. Defendant waived his right to a jury trial and there was testimony that defendant suffered from a paranoid type of schizophrenia and polysubstance dependence at the time of the alleged offense. The court affirmed and held that it was not necessary to extend the protection of the Lessary &quot;same conduct&quot; test to &quot;multiple punishments&quot; cases. Also, application of the Blockburger &quot;same elements&quot; test to alleged violations of double jeopardy revealed that defendant's constitutional rights had not been violated. Attempted murder required that the person intended to cause the death of another person--an element not present in the use of a firearm offense. Each offense had an element which the others did not and thus were separate offenses for double jeopardy purposes. Further, the record showed that both doctors conducted a thorough examination of defendant and there was substantial evidence to support the circuit court's conclusion that defendant was penally responsible for his conduct at the time he shot the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While he was incarcerated, appellant argued that he was (1) illegally punished for violating former Haw. Admin.

The reviewing court determined that Hawaii's extended term sentencing scheme did not run afoul of Apprendi. The reviewing court's approach to Hawaii's extended term sentencing scheme was not at odds with Booker, because (1) Booker's holding was limited to the federal sentencing guidelines, and (2) Hawaii's extended term sentencing structure was not mandatory. Because Booker merely struck down the compulsory nature of the otherwise legitimate federal sentencing guidelines scheme, Hawaii's wholly discretionary extended term sentencing apparatus did not fall within Booker's purview.</SPAN></P>

Ordinance art. 39, unconstitutional and to enjoin its enforcement on grounds that it violated the rights to freedom of privacy and speech as set forth in the Haw. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 4 and 6. The First Circuit Court, Hawai'i, ruled in favor of the appellee city. The business filed its notice of appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The business rented and sold adult videotapes and operated an arcade consisting of 12 panoram booths. The business's application for a panoram business license was denied because the business's agents could not aver that the business complied with all of the licensure requirements in article 39. The city's ordinance required open entry of the panoram booths. On appeal, the business contended that this open-entry policy violated (1) the right to freedom of expression in Haw. Const. art. 1, &sect; 4, and (2) the right to privacy in Haw. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6. The business challenged the ordinance on state constitutional grounds only. The supreme court concluded that the Hawai'i constitutional right to privacy did not encompass the right to view adult material in an enclosed booth within a commercial establishment. The right to privacy encompassed the correlative right to purchase pornographic material as it was used in the home, and not in a private place of one's own choosing. Also, contrary to the business's argument, the ordinance left alternative channel of communications available. Finally, the business failed to establish that the open-entry requirement would involve greater expense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of five counts of terroristic threatening in the first degree and one count of terroristic threatening in the second degree.

The court found that there was no indication in the record that the trial court erroneously considered any uncharged conduct in imposing defendant's sentence. Indeed, the sentences were lenient, considering that defendant pled guilty to, inter alia, five counts of first-degree terroristic threatening, Class C felonies subject to five-year indeterminate maximum terms of imprisonment. Defendant was certainly not entitled to probation without a term of imprisonment, and it was within the trial court's discretion to sentence him to probation, subject to a one-year term of imprisonment as a special condition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, an outdoor vending cart space tenant, challenged a judgment of the District Court of the First Circuit Court (Hawaii) that granted plaintiff landlord's motion for a writ of possession pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 666-11 (1993). The tenant claimed that the rent trust fund statute,&nbsp;Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 666-21 (1993), violated the due process and equal protection clauses of Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenant challenged the rent trust fund order based on her claim that she was not allowed to take possession of the outdoor vending cart spaces that she had rented from the landlord. The tenant also claimed that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 666-21 violated her rights to due process and equal protection. The court held that &sect; 666-21 did not violate the tenant's due process and equal protection rights because &sect; 666-21 provided for, and the tenant was given, notice and a hearing with respect to possession of the property. Also, a deposit of rent into the fund did not affect the tenant's rights to assert that the rent had been paid or that other grounds for nonpayment existed. However, the court found that the trial court did not make a finding as to whether the tenant was in possession of the premises to warrant application of &sect; 666-21. Therefore, the court held that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a hearing on whether tenant was given possession before it ordered that a fund be established because a rent trust fund was intended to prevent the situation in which tenants could not or would not pay for the time they were in possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the trial court's judgment for possession and writ of possession and remanded the case for a hearing as to whether possession had been given to the tenant so as to justify the imposition of rent trust fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured was injured in an accident and made a claim for UIM benefits. The trial court held that because the insured received benefits under the personal injury protection (PIP) coverage in his policy, his UIM benefits were to be reduced per Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 431:10C-301.5 (Supp. 2000). On appeal, the insured argued that &sect; 431:10C-301.5 did not apply to UIM benefits and that &sect; 431:10C-301.5 was unconstitutional. The appellate court rejected both arguments and affirmed the trial court. The appellate court held that &sect; 431:10C-301.5 and the reasoning of State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Gepaya applied to UIM cases because although the legislature considered uninsured (UM) and UIM benefits to be separate coverages, there was no meaningful distinction between UM and UIM benefits with regard to the applicability of the covered loss deductible. The state supreme court also held that &sect; 431:10C-301.5 was not unconstitutional, as the statute was designed to prevent double recovery for medical expenses that had already been paid under the insured's PIP coverage, and such policy determinations were expressly within the constitutional purview of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a probate proceeding involving a large estate created over 100 years ago, appellee trustees filed a petition for settlement approval and to exclude the press and public from the hearing; appellees, a television station and a newspaper, moved to intervene and to deny the trustees' petition to close the courtroom. The newspaper's and the station's motions were denied and they sought mandamus relief. Mandamus relief was denied, and they appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the newspaper and the station argued that filing a motion to intervene was an appropriate means of raising assertions of public rights of access to information regarding matters in litigation. The trustees argued that neither the station nor the newspaper was an &quot;interested person&quot; as defined in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 560:1-201 (Supp. 2003). The supreme court agreed with the trustees, holding that the term &quot;interested person&quot; as defined in &sect; 560:1-201 did not include a party interested solely in challenging a closure order in a probate proceeding. Thus, denial of permissive intervention pursuant to Haw. R. Civ. P. 24 was not an abuse of discretion. However, the supreme court also held that a common law presumption of judicial openness accompanied probate proceedings, which could be overcome only upon a showing of strong countervailing reasons that outweighed the public's presumptive right of access to court proceedings and records. Further, the supreme court held, any person, including the media, was entitled to challenge petitions to close probate proceedings or seal probate records, and a writ of prohibition was an appropriate vehicle for challenging a closure order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order denying intervention was affirmed, but the newspaper and the television station were granted leave to file a petition for writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Hawai'i) granted the State's motion and imposed mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-660.1 (1993) and made some of the sentences consecutive. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The indictment charged defendant with stealing a rifle and semi-automatic rifle, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 708-830.5(1)(b). The appellate court held that the trial court erred sentencing defendant to mandatory terms of imprisonment under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-660.1, as that statute required enhanced punishment only when the defendant used or threatened to use a firearm or a semi-automatic firearm in the actual commission of the crime. As defendant's theft of a firearm was the entire felony -- in other words, there was no underlying felony that defendant committed while possessing or using a firearm - his conduct fell outside of the ambit of &sect; 706-660.1. The trial court plainly erred in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-668.5 based on the prosecutor's unsubstantiated allegation that defendant had transferred the semi-automatic firearm he was convicted of stealing to a drug dealer.</SPAN></P>

However, the appellate court held that the error of including tampering with a witness as a lesser-included offense was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it was possible to commit the greater offense of intimidating a witness without committing the lesser offense of tampering with a witness and the error likely contributed to defendant's conviction. The appellate court concluded that assuming arguendo that the prosecution did commit prosecutorial misconduct in referring to the underlying abuse case, there was no reasonable possibility that the prosecution's misconduct could have contributed to defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err when it found that the mother failed to prove a causal relationship between the alleged acts and omissions of State employees and her son's death. The mother did not meet her burden of proving legal causation. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding the State costs pursuant to Haw. R. Civ. P. 68. The State made a settlement offer to the mother, which she did not accept, and the judgment after trial was not more favorable to the mother than the settlement offer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a prior order that granted summary judgment to the individuals, the trial court had required that an environmental impact statement (EIS) be prepared for the project as a prerequisite for use of state lands and had voided the department's underlying lease with the corporation. The court held that the trial court retained jurisdiction to render a decision after the case was remanded to the commission because motions for reconsideration that had been filed extended its jurisdiction pursuant to Haw. R. Civ. P. 59(e). Thus, the trial court had not entered final judgment. Furthermore, the trial court possessed jurisdiction to grant summary judgment pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 343-7(b) (1993). No genuine issues of material fact existed, and the trial court could decide, as a matter of law, whether an EIS was required with respect to a power plant project on the land. The lease of state lands for the use of a proposed power plant was a use of state lands, and the proposed power plant would result in substantial energy consumption. The court concluded that the voiding of the lease did not constitute a due process violation or a taking of private property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying the motion to suppress because the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to stop her vehicle. The supreme court agreed. The stop rested on the slender fact that a passenger had been picked up by defendant in her vehicle at the police station on the previous night. That the passenger had been arrested for promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree and had informed an officer that defendant was a supplier of drugs, did not constitute facts from which it reasonably could be inferred that the passenger would be found in defendant's vehicle at the time of the stop. The officers did not identify the other occupants of the car before the stop, they detained defendant even after determining that the passenger was not in the vehicle, the detention was for the purpose of permitting a canine search for drugs unrelated to the apprehension of the passenger, and the police had no search warrant for the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in sentencing him as a repeat offender. The supreme court disagreed. In its written order granting the prosecution's motion for repeat offender sentencing, the trial court imposed only one mandatory minimum prison term of three years and four months. In addition, the trial court imposed extended term sentences of ten years in two counts to run concurrently. Accordingly, any error that the circuit court committed by orally stating that the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment applied both to counts I and II was harmless, because defendant was, in fact, serving only one mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of three years and four months. Defendant clearly understood that the circuit court had an obligation to impose a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-606.5 as a result of his conviction of promoting a dangerous drug, and had in fact imposed that very mandatory minimum in connection with count I. As such, there was no reasonable possibility that the circuit court's oral slip of the tongue contributed to defendant's sentence and any resulting error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1249(1) (1993). The terroristic threatening case against defendant was premised on both defendant's words and conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of varying degrees of unauthorized entry, burglary, terroristic threatening, kidnapping, sexual assault, and attempted murder. On appeal, the court held that, inasmuch as defendant was never convicted of assault in the first degree, any procedural error in the circuit court's probable cause determination with respect to that count was moot. The court held that defendant's inculpatory statement to the police was admissible, inasmuch as the circuit court did not clearly err in finding that the statement did not stem from police questioning so as to have been the product of custodial interrogation. The court determined that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying motions for mistrial, because the challenged prosecutorial misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the circuit court did not plainly err in admitting expert testimony at the sentencing hearing and rejected the contention that the expert was without authority to conduct a psychological assessment or testify. The court concluded that the sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment or a plain and manifest abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The district court denied his motion to suppress the results of a blood test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was involved in a single-car motor vehicle accident. An officer noted that defendant exhibited red, watery eyes, and the odor of liquor emanated from his breath. At the hospital, a forcible blood extraction was performed by a nurse against defendant's will. The trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to suppress the results of that blood test. To justify the blood draw under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 286-163, the police officer testified as to inadmissible hearsay statements from an anonymous physician that defendant was injured. The testimony did not fall within a recognized hearsay exception. The prosecution was judicially estopped from claiming that the Hawai'i Rules of Evidence did not apply. Without the blood test results, defendant's conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court properly denied the inmate's petition as frivolous. The inmate failed to show that a mental examination would have provided a meritorious defense. The sentencing judge's determination was not arbitrary; therefore, Haw. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 706-668.5 was not unconstitutional as applied to the inmate. The 35-year minimum sentence imposed by the Hawai'i Paroling Authority (HPA) was within the five to 50 year range established by the HPA's guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii), which convicted him of sexual assault in the fourth degree under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-733(1)(a) (1993) and imposed a special condition of probation that defendant register as a sex offender pursuant to the sex offender registration and public notification law, Haw.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the sex offender registration and public notification requirements of Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 846E (Supp. 2001) violated provisions in the United States and Hawai'i Constitutions relating to procedural due process, ex post facto laws, cruel and unusual punishment, the right to privacy, and equal protection. The court found that prior case law had determined that the registration requirements of Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 846E were valid and did not implicate any fundamental right to privacy. However, the lack of procedural safeguards in the notification provisions violated the due process requirements of Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and rendered the notification provisions unconstitutional, void, and unenforceable. Thus, the court vacated the portion of the judgment requiring defendant to submit to the notification requirements. The court rejected defendant's ex post facto and cruel and unusual punishment claims because defendant failed to indicate how Chapter 846E would violate Hawai'i's ex post facto law or constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court did not address defendant's right to privacy or equal protection claims as to the void notification requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed from the trial court's order granting defendant's motion to dismiss Count III of a complaint against him charging him with a violation of Haw.

The court stated that the count was improperly dismissed because defendant was not entitled to a procedural due process hearing prior to registration, because the initial act of registration did not impose on a protected liberty interest. Further, defendant failed to demonstrate that the registration requirements under Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 846E constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Hawaii Constitution. Defendant was not afforded a hearing to determine whether public notification was warranted. Because that violated procedural due process, the public notification provisions were unenforceable as to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of placing his penis on his daughter's body and placing his hand on her breast. The state supreme court held that defendant did not have standing to raise a constitutional overbreadth challenge on the ground that &sect; 707-733(1)(a) might conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others. Defendant's conduct was not constitutionally protected, such that he did not have standing to raise an overbreadth claim. Because &sect; 707-733(1)(a) was neither vague nor overbroad as applied to defendant, the family court did not err in refusing to limit its scope in instructing the jury. Although defendant also argued that Haw. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in allowing a witness's testimony regarding the complainant's competency and &quot;laid-back&quot; personality. The court found that the witness's testimony did not fall into the category of impermissible character evidence under Haw. R. Evid. 404(a)(2), as it was relevant to the determination of the tone of the complainant's conversation with the witness, to illustrate how the witness knew the complainant, and to explain how the witness was able to discern whether the complainant was upset. The evidence also did not fall under the limitations of Haw. R. Evid. 608, because the testimony was not proffered to rehabilitate the complainant's credibility, nor did it go to her character for truthfulness. The absence of procedural safeguards in the public notification provision of Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 846E (Supp. 2001) violated Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 5's due process requirements, and thus, rendered the public notification provision void and unenforceable. The failure to afford defendant a hearing to determine whether public notification was warranted violated procedural due process. Thus, the public notification provisions were unenforceable as to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant argued that the insurer could not bring a separate declaratory judgment action regarding the applicability of the covered loss deductible, as the parties did not agree to reserve that issue for disposition after the arbitration proceedings. On appeal, the court held that the claimant was judicially estopped from arguing that the insurer was precluded from bringing a declaratory judgment action because he stated that the parties had agreed to reserve the question in a prior answering brief. The declaratory judgment action was not an improper collateral attack on the judgment affirming the arbitration award. The court held that the covered loss deductible applied to UM claims and that &sect; 431:10C-301.5 was constitutional. The court rejected the claimant's contention that the passage of &sect; 431:10C-301.5 constituted an unconstitutional taking because the statute was in effect when the arbitration awarded was entered and when it was affirmed such that the statute pre-existed the claimant's purported property interest. The claimant's argument that his due process rights were violated also failed, because the State did not interfere with any property interest of the claimant.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the First and Fourteenth Amendments safeguard the rights of free speech and assembly by limitations on state action, not on action by the owner of private property used nondiscriminatorily for private purposes only. The court concluded that there had been no state action abridging defendant's right of free speech. The court found that Haw. Const. art.

The supreme court disagreed. The lifetime registration component of the Hawai'i sex offender registration statute implicated a protected liberty interest and required that minimum requirements of due process--notice and the opportunity to be heard--be afforded to convicted sex offenders. Such a proceeding could be instituted by a sex offender in a special proceeding. However, a hearing prior to registration was not mandated. The act of registration, itself, did not impose on defendant's protected liberty interest. Because of the nature of the absolute lifetime requirements due process did not require that a hearing be held at any specific time.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 291E-38(e) (Supp. 2001) by a hearing officer of the Hawai'i Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office (ADLRO).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the arrestee argued that the trial court erred in impliedly ruling that his state and federal constitutional rights to a public hearing were not violated with respect to his right to a hearing on the ADLRO restrictions on public access and public access to his ADLRO hearing. The court held that the arrestee could not assert a right of public access to the Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office (ADLRO) on behalf of an anonymous woman who refused to comply with the request that she sign in and provide identification before being permitted entry into the arrestee's license revocation hearing. Because the woman who was subject to the identification procedure could have directly challenged the restrictions, there was no need to extend standing to the arrestee. However, the court concluded that due process required that the hearings be public, because ADLRO hearings were quasi-judicial administrative hearings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the driver contended that the trial court erred in granting the complainants' motion to enforce their respective judgments, because the trial court refused to apply the covered loss deductible statute,&nbsp;Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 431:10C-301.5 (Supp. 1998), to reduce the amount of each award. The supreme court agreed that the arbitration awards were subject to a covered loss deduction; however, because the driver failed to raise the statute during the arbitration proceedings, failed to apply to the arbitration administrator to reduce the awards, and failed to file a notice of appeal and request for a trial de novo, the arbitration awards were entered as unappealable final judgments under Haw. R. Cir. Ct. 21, which the trial court was precluded from modifying or vacating. Moreover, by failing to challenge the arbitration awards until the complainants moved to enforce the judgments, the driver impermissibly sought to collaterally attack the judgments. As such, the trial court did not err in granting the complainants' motion to enforce the final judgments.</SPAN></P>

Defendant took a shiny object out of his pocket, and he cut the rear window out of a car. When police arrived, the witness identified defendant. On appeal, defendant claimed that, as a matter of plain error, &sect; 708-812(1)(a) was unconstitutional; the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to convict defendant of the burglary tools charge; the jury instructions and verdict form were fatally insufficient. As to the statute's constitutionality, defendant claimed that burglary tools could be anything, such as a shoe or a cane. Nevertheless, the supreme court concluded that &sect; 708-812(1)(a) was not vague, because it described the proscribed conduct in ordinary and understandable terms. Also, the statute clearly informed a person that a violation of the statute might be avoided so long as the articles were not employed with the culpable intent set forth in the statute. Moreover, defendant did not have standing to argue the unconstitutionally of the statute as applied to others. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After both houses of the legislature passed the proposed amendment, it was presented to the voters. The court noted that the case was not a typical election contest, wherein a complainant challenged the results of an election. Instead, in challenging the validity of the amendment, the voters essentially questioned the propriety of the Office of Elections placing the amendment on the ballot in the first instance. The court thus rejected the officials' argument that the voters had to demonstrate that the acts of which they complained would have had the effect of changing the results of the election. Laches did not bar the voters' suit because it was filed within 10 days of being put on constructive notice, which was the first publication date of voter education material. The court concluded that the amendment was not validly ratified in accordance with the mandate of Haw. Const. art. XVII, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3. The actual text of the amendment was not published in any newspaper of general circulation until six days prior to the general election, rather than for four successive weeks prior to the election as required.

The ICA recommended that the second condition be amended to take effect if a problem with drugs or alcohol was indicated following an assessment. The court held that the sentencing court had no basis, other than the unsubstantiated argument of the prosecutor, in determining that substance abuse conditions were warranted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Second Circuit Court (Hawai'i), which convicted him of two counts of continuous sexual assault of a minor under the age of 14 years, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-733.5 (Supp. 2002). Defendant contended that &sect; 707-733.5 was unconstitutional in that it violated his rights to due process and a unanimous verdict under U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV, and Haw. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 5 and 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of sexually abusing his step-daughters on several different occasions, but the step-daughters could not testify as to specific dates. Defendant contended that the circuit court's failure to give the jury a specific unanimity instruction was erroneous because Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-733.5 was not a &quot;continuous offense&quot; statute. Vacating defendant's conviction and remanding, the court held that &sect; 707-733.5 was not an &quot;alternative means&quot; statute, but rather a &quot;multiple acts&quot; statute. Regardless of the fact that the Legislature deemed &sect; 707-733.5 to be a continuing offense, it was for the court to ascertain whether multiple acts of sexual penetration of sexual contact under &sect; 707-733.5 was a continuing offense. Pursuant to the statute's terms, several acts had to be alleged and any combination of them could constitute the crime charged. Thus, such acts were, by nature, separate and discrete. Accordingly, in order to satisfy due process and the unanimous verdict requirement under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and Haw. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 5 and 14, the trial court should have instructed the jury that it had to be unanimous as to which acts constituted the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the circuit court's judgment of conviction and defendant's sentence, and it remanded for further proceedings. The court also struck down the subsection of the statute that required unanimity only as to the requisite number, but it emphasized that the remainder of the statute clearly passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contractor sought judicial review of a dismissal order by respondent state department of budget &amp; fiscal services, which refused to hear the contractor's plea for an administrative hearing to review a decision by the department's purchasing agency to accept another contractor's lower bid on a project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department's purchasing agency advertised a job, which the contractor bid on. A different contractor with a lower bid was selected. The contractor filed a protest, complaining that the other contractor failed to list a licensed plumber, so the bid should have been rejected. The department's director denied the protest. The contractor requested an administrative hearing, which was dismissed because the request was sent to the wrong office and was untimely. The contractor petitioned for judicial review, arguing the department erred in dismissing the request as untimely under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 103D-712(a) (1999). The court found the main disagreement was over the meaning of the word &quot;issuance&quot; of the agency's decision intended by &sect; 103D-712a. The court found the date of &quot;issuance&quot; meant, at the latest, the date on which the decision was mailed. Moreover, the untimeliness of the contractor's request had less to do with the date the contractor received the denial letter and more with its failure to comply with the filing mandate of the statute. Had its request been filed directly with the hearings office, instead of the purchasing agency, the request would have been timely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order dismissing the contractor's plea for an administrative hearing.</SPAN></P>

Correlatively, however, there were limits to what police could do unfettered with lawfully obtained blood samples. Those limits included the legitimate use of DNA evidence for identification purposes only. Consequently, the lab's use of defendant's blood sample was proper, and was limited to the purposes for which it could have used a fingerprint in such an investigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the District Court of the Third Circuit (Hawaii), which convicted him of indecent exposure, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-734(1), to a minor and which required him to register, pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 846E-1, as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that he should have been afforded a jury trial because of the &quot;penalty&quot; of registration, he should not have been required to register, and portions of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 846E-1 were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court held that defendant was not subject to registration as a sex offender, because indecent exposure was not an offense that entailed &quot;criminal sexual conduct.&quot; Venue was proper, because the crime was committed in Kona on the island of Hawaii, which constituted the third judicial circuit. Because defendant attempted to prolong his conversation with the minor's mother and moved his chair into a position that allowed him to display his genitalia to the minor, the evidence enabled a person of reasonable caution to conclude that defendant's conduct was intentional under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 702-206. The minor's opinion that defendant acted intentionally met the three criteria of Haw. R. Evid. 701. Moreover, the trial court was accorded greater discretion in asking the minor questions because it held a jury-waived trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment and sentence, except that it vacated the requirement that defendant register as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>

Although the prosecution's statement that the trial court had the last word on the propriety of identification procedures was improper, such misconduct was harmless because the jury was properly instructed and the prosecution adduced substantial evidence that defendant was the person who committed the charged offenses.

The district court sentenced defendant to a six-month term of probation and ordered him, inter alia, to register under the sex offender registration and notification statute, Haw. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following defendant's conviction for indecent exposure, he argued that the sex offender registration and notification statute, Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 846E (Supp. 1998), did not apply to him. He also argued that chapter 846E violated state and federal constitutional provisions regarding: due process; cruel and unusual punishment; the right to privacy; and the right to equal protection of the laws. The Supreme Court of Hawai'i held that indecent exposure, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-734 (1993), did not constitute an offense subject to the sex registration and public notification requirements of Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 846E. Accordingly, defendant was not required to register as a &quot;sex offender&quot; pursuant to chapter 846E.
