</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District Court, Salt Lake Department, Utah, dismissed plaintiff adult's case for lack of standing against the State requesting a declaratory judgment that Utah's sodomy and fornication statutes were null and void as violations of the adult's constitutional right to liberty and privacy and his right to intimate personal expression. The adult appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adult argued that the trial court erred in dismissing his case for lack of standing. The adult claimed that he had a palpable injury because prosecutors had pursued sodomy and fornication charges within the past few years, and the adult desired to and anticipated he would further engage in conduct prohibited by Utah's sodomy and fornication laws. The appellate court determined that there was no authority supporting the proposition that the State would use Utah's sodomy and fornication statutes against those individuals who merely engaged in consensual sodomy or fornication with a sixteen - or seventeen-year-old. The adult failed to provide a credible basis for his contentions that he was in a group likely to be prosecuted and that he had a legitimate fear of prosecution. There were defendants whom the State had actually and separately charged with sodomy where it had brought more serious charges, and it was these individuals who were more likely to be prosecuted. The case did not raise such issues of public importance as to permit the appellate court to grant the adult standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fifth District, St. George Department (Utah), convicted defendant of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6a-502 (2005); having an open alcoholic beverage container in a vehicle, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6a-526 (2005); two counts of automobile homicide, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-207 (Supp. 2005); and two counts of child abuse, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-109 (Supp. 2005). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant rolled his pickup truck. Defendant's wife and unborn child were killed, and he and his two children were seriously injured. Based on a blood draw taken just after the accident, defendant's blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit. Specifically, the test results of the blood draw put defendant's blood alcohol concentration at .240 - three times the legal limit. Given that the trial court found on remand that defendant was unconscious when his blood was drawn, he was incapable of withdrawing his implied consent to the blood draw pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6a-522 (2005). Accordingly, it would have been futile for his trial counsel to have sought to suppress the blood draw evidence, and defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim on that issue failed. But, because all of the elements of DUI had to be proven to establish automobile homicide, the conclusion appeared obvious that defendant was facing double jeopardy and that trial counsel should have requested that the two offenses be consolidated. Thus, defendant's counsel was ineffective for failing to seek consolidation of the charges pursuant to the merger doctrine in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-1-402.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction on the DUI charge and vacated his sentence for that offense. Otherwise, the appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Drugs and paraphernalia were found at defendant's residence during a search. Thereafter, a child services investigator came to the residence. At that time, defendant admitted to using drugs on two occasions. The investigator then saw defendant nursing her baby. She was then charged with endangerment of a child, in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-112.5 (2003). At the preliminary hearing, the investigator testified about the nursing incident, but defendant and the child were not drug tested. After defendant's motion to dismiss was denied, she sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the State failed to meet its burden of showing probable cause. There as not sufficient evidence to show that the crime was committed and defendant committed it. The question of whether marijuana was actually present in the breast milk was of sufficient scientific complexity as to be beyond the realm of common experience. Therefore, expert testimony was required. The evidence produced at the preliminary hearing had to be admissible under the Utah Rules of Evidence. There was no foundation for the expertise of the child investigator; therefore, she did not qualify in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had marijuana and associated paraphernalia in her residence. After a search warrant was executed, defendant was charged with two counts of child endangerment under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-112.5 (2003). A preliminary hearing was held, and defendant was bound over for trial. She then filed an appeal. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's assertion that &sect; 76-5-112.5 was unconstitutional due to vagueness. Although the term &quot;exposed to&quot; was not defined in the statute, it was sufficiently definite to have adequately warned defendant that her conduct was illegal. The court was unable to write an element of risk back into the statute because it had been previously removed by the Utah Legislature. Further, defendant's conduct fell within the broad definition of &quot;exposed to.&quot; Also, the court held that the statute was sufficiently definite so as to discourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Police officers encountering the circumstances presented in defendant's case would not have discretion in applying the statute. Finally, the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing was sufficient to support bindover.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, herself a child, appeals the Utah juvenile court's denial of her motion to dismiss a delinquency petition alleging she sexually abused a child. This offense would have been a second degree felony if committed by an adult, pursuant to Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-404.1 (2003). She argued that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to juveniles under 14 years of age who had uncoerced sex with each other.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant was 13, she and a 12-year-old boy engaged in mutually welcome sexual intercourse, and she became pregnant. The State filed a delinquency petition alleging she had committed sexual abuse of a child, a second degree felony if committed by an adult. She moved to dismiss on constitutional grounds. The juvenile court determined that the application of the statute to her did not violate her constitutional rights and denied her motion to dismiss. At issue was whether Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-404.1 (2003) was unconstitutional as applied to juveniles under the age of 14 who engaged in mutually welcome sexual activities with their peers. The class at issue was juveniles under the age of 14--the class created by the sexual abuse of a child statute. All persons within this class were treated equally. The question, then, was whether the classification was proper. Appellant failed to meet her burden of showing that the classifications created by the statutory scheme or any disparate treatment of those classes was not reasonably related to a legitimate legislative interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonprofit corporation argued that the trial court erred by denying its request for attorney fees pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine. The appellate court noted that Utah followed the traditional American rule that attorney fees could not be recovered by a prevailing party unless a statute or contract authorized such an award; however, a court had the inherent equitable power to award reasonable attorney fees when it deemed it appropriate in the interests of justice and equity. The appellate court held that the trial court's factual findings intermingled elements of many of the various equitable doctrines by which a party could have qualified for attorney fees, but did not specifically address the nonprofit corporation's private attorney general doctrine claim, enter adequate findings concerning its claim that its efforts vindicated a societally important public policy, or decide whether its actions transcended its own pecuniary interests to an extent requiring subsidization. The appellate court concluded that whether a trial court awarded or denied requested fees, it had to support its decision with sufficient factual findings to provide a basis for that decision.</SPAN></P>

The friend suffered a gunshot to the elbow. Thereafter, defendant was charged with aggravated assault. He appealed after the juvenile court entered an order transferring him for trial as an adult under the SYOA. In affirming, the court determined that the SYOA's third retention factor under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-602(3)(b)(iii) (2002) did not require a finding that the minor acted with a level of violence and aggression greater than that inherent in the underlying offense. Next, the juvenile court correctly applied the third retention factor to determine that defendant failed to prove that his role in the aggravated assault was not violent or aggressive. The facts showed that he pointed a gun at someone and fired. It was irrelevant that he was joking. The court noted that another case where no violence or aggression was found was distinguishable because there was no active participation in the crime. That was totally different than the facts of defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sued appellee city in the Third District Court, Salt Lake Department, Utah, claiming that the planning commission's denial of its application for approval of a subdivision plat, together with the city mayor's rejection of an appeal, constituted an unconstitutional taking of property. The trial court dismissed the state claims for want of subject matter jurisdiction and the federal claims as unripe. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner argued that the trial court erred in dismissing its state takings claims for failure to comply with the notice-of-claim requirements of the Utah Governmental Immunity Act (UGIA). Specifically, the landowner contended that the right to recovery under the Utah Constitution could not be modified or restricted by the UGIA because Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 22 was self-executing. The appellate court noted that because an inverse condemnation action was a claim brought under a self-executing provision of the constitution, the State was not immune under the UGIA. The appellate court held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 63-30-10.5(1) (1997) of the UGIA contained a waiver of immunity for inverse condemnation claims; however, the fact that the legislature chose to explain, by statute, that the government was not immune from takings claims did not mean that a constitutional inverse condemnation claim was brought pursuant to the UGIA. The appellate court concluded that the trial erred in dismissing the landowner's state takings claims for failure to comply with the notice-of-claim requirements of the UGIA and its federal takings claims for lack of ripeness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in a justice court with domestic battery under Salt Lake City, Utah, Code &sect; 11.08.020 (2003) and filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the ordinance unconstitutionally conflicted with the Utah assault statute. The justice court denied the motion and defendant filed a petition for extraordinary relief in the Third District Court, Salt Lake Department, Utah, which was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was on active duty in the military, asserted that under federal law, the military could discharge him if he was convicted of any charge related to domestic violence, even if the charge was overturned on appeal. He contended that the justice court failed to rule that the ordinance unconstitutionally conflicted with the state assault statute and that the trial court erred by affirming the justice court's decision. The appellate court initially noted that in order to conflict, an ordinance had to literally prohibit that which the statute allowed in contrast to the state law. The appellate court found that the ordinance required a greater culpable mental state, did not prohibit attempts and threats, and required that the acts take place within Salt Lake City. The appellate court held that the Salt Lake City ordinance did not unconstitutionally conflict with the state assault statute; therefore, the trial court and the justice court did not err, exceed their jurisdiction, abuse their discretion, or fail to perform a required act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth District Court, Provo Department, Utah, convicted defendant of one count of communications fraud, a second degree felony, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1801 (2001). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1801, both on its face and as it was applied to him. The appellate court, however, recently determined that the statute was facially valid, and thus not subject to broad attack on either vagueness or overbreadth grounds. Defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague as applied to his case failed to comport with Utah R. App. P. 24 because he failed to develop any authority that might support his claim. Even if the appellate court were to examine the claim on its merits, the outcome would remain unchanged. The statutory language of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1801(1) was sufficiently clear to have put defendant on notice that his conduct violated the statute. Defendant's accomplice had confessed that she had provided false information to avoid paying the medical costs associated with her hospitalization and implicated defendant's participation in the scheme. Defendant's conduct clearly fell into an area prohibited by the statute, and the police officers were not improperly left to decide, in their discretion, that the statute's provisions should not apply.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the felony murder rule should be abolished. Nevertheless, the felony murder rule was not unconstitutional. Defendant next argued that an error existed because she was convicted of both aggravated kidnapping and felony murder, and these convictions were enhanced. The double enhancement, she argued, resulted in a double jeopardy violation. Nevertheless, the trial court indicated that it sentenced defendant to the maximum of the mandatory minimum sentences because of the result of the crime: the death of an innocent person. Defendant's claim that her sentence was enhanced by the aggravated kidnapping conviction and the gang enhancement provision failed. Defendant argued that an error existed because there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction for the aggravated kidnapping, because the verdicts were inconsistent. Inconsistent verdicts did not equate to insufficient evidence. Finally, because defendant had not established that the trial court erred, she could not succeed on the claim that her counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State leased a railroad depot to the taxpayer's predecessor so it could operate a cafe within the depot, which also housed a museum. The lease was assigned to the taxpayer. The board ruled that the taxpayer was obliged to pay a privilege tax and an escaped property tax assessment. The Commission reversed, finding that the taxpayer's use of the depot entitled it to the concession exemption to the privilege tax, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-4-101(3)(a). The appellate court held that the cafe was a &quot;concession in a public airport or similar property&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 59-4-101(3)(a). The cafe was available to patrons of the depot, including museum guests and rail passengers, as well as the general public. It was a ''concession&quot; under &sect; 59-4-101(3)(a), because the State granted the taxpayer property to be used for a specific purpose. As the taxpayer qualified for the concession exemption, it was not subject to the escaped property tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state employee filed suit in the Third District Court, Sandy Department (Utah) against defendants legislators claiming a violation of the Utah Protection of Public Employees Act (UPPEA), Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-21-1 to -9 (2004). The case was dismissed. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to the employee, sometime after his department's budget reduction, one of the legislator's made a veiled threat to the employee's supervisor that if he did not implement the budget cuts to eliminate the employee's position, the legislator would push for future cuts in the department's budget appropriations. Subsequently, the employee's position was eliminated. The employee argued that through their actions affecting him, the legislators were acting as agents of his employer, and therefore should be considered an employer for purposes of the UPPEA. The court of appeals disagreed. The legislators did not act on behalf of the department, nor were they subject to the control of the department. The department was acting under the direction of the legislators and thus acting as their agent by eliminating the specified positions. Consequently, the UPPEA did not provide a proper legal basis for the suit. The legislators were not the employee's employer, nor were they agents of his employer. Therefore, because the UPPEA was the sole basis of the complaint, he failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1994, the city charged defendant with four misdemeanor counts of communications fraud. In 1996, the circuit court dismissed the misdemeanor charges, ruling that the aggregate of the four misdemeanor counts exceeded the circuit court's jurisdictional limit. The city appealed, but moved the court to dismiss its appeal, because the State was prepared to file felony counts. Defendant subsequently moved the district court to dismiss the felony charges, but that motion was denied. He then entered a conditional plea in which he preserved his right to challenge the constitutionality of the communications fraud statute and the jurisdiction of the district court to hear the felony charges. The court affirmed his attempted communications fraud conviction, stating that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1801 (1994) had already been held constitutional. Further, a valid judgment existed on the record when felony charges were filed. The subsequent recall of a remittitur on defendant's motion did not change that fact. For that reason, the district court did not lack jurisdiction when charges were filed in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parishioners contended that they had been sexually abused by a priest in the 1970s. They filed an action against the diocese, the high school, and other individuals in 2003. After the trial court granted a motion for summary judgment, the parishioners sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the trial court applied the proper standard under Utah R. Civ. P. 56(c). The standard articulated by the trial court was not inconsistent with Rule 56(c). The parishioner's motion for discovery under Rule 56(f) was denied by implication. Further, the statute of limitations on the claims asserted ranged from one to four years under Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 78-12-25(3), -26(3), -29(4) (2002). The limitations period was tolled until the parishioners reached the age of 18 under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-36 (2002). The discovery rule did not apply because the parishioners had sufficient knowledge of the claim within the limitations period. The court rejected their causal connection and clear and convincing evidence theories. Further, no amount of discovery would have helped the claims. Finally, the court determined that the parishioner's constitutional rights had not been violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District Court, Salt Lake Department (Utah) dismissed plaintiff companies' complaint for lack of jurisdiction based on the failure to exhaust administrative remedies. This was before the court on one company's motion for summary reversal based on manifest error, and on defendant Utah Tax Commission's (Commission) motion for summary affirmance based on the lack of a substantial question for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies were sexually explicit businesses. When a new tax was imposed on sexually explicit businesses, one company filed a complaint pursuing an injunction against enforcement of the new tax and a judgment that it was unconstitutional because it imposed a content-based tax in violation of the First Amendment. The Commission moved to dismiss, arguing the complaint alleged &quot;as applied&quot; challenges to the tax, and the company was required to exhaust its administrative remedies before moving to court. The trial court dismissed, finding the company was required to exhaust its administrative remedies. However, the issue was whether the tax on its face violated the First Amendment, precluding its application at all. This was solely a constitutional challenge; a threshold legal issue that could not be impacted or avoided by administrative proceedings. There was no administrative determination that could have obviated the need to reach the constitutional issue. Because the exhaustion of administrative remedies would have served no useful purpose, exhaustion was not required. The claim was properly before the court, so it was error to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court dismissed the student's first suit on the grounds that the untimely notice of claim did not satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisites of the Utah Governmental Immunity Act and that judicial review of academic decisions was not available under the Utah Administrative Procedures Act. The second suit again sought judicial review and reversal of the prior decision terminating the student's graduate studies, but also claimed damages for alleged violations of rights, emotional distress, and unconstitutional taking of property. The appellate court ruled that the district court correctly dismissed the second suit based upon principles of res judicata. Issue preclusion prevented relitigation of the claim seeking judicial review and reversal of the decision to terminate the student's enrollment in the Ph.D. program, and the claims in both cases arose from the same facts and were completed before the first suit was filed. Also, the district court correctly denied the request for default judgment, Utah R. Civ. P. 55(e), as the student did not establish his claim to the satisfaction of the district court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the three years prior to the appeal, the citizen had engaged in private, heterosexual, consensual sexual acts with another unmarried adult. He admitted the acts violated Utah's criminal laws against sodomy, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-403(1) (2003), and fornication, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-7-104 (2003). He stated that he continued to violate the statutes, and feared criminal prosecution for his past, present, and future conduct. He filed a federal civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 (2003), claiming the statutes unlawfully criminalized his private behavior protected under the federal and state constitutions. The cases the citizen cited did not show that the State was likely to prosecute consenting adults who violated the fornication and sodomy statutes. Rather, the cases demonstrated that the State would occasionally use the statutes against two classes of people: (1) individuals charged with rape or forcible sodomy; and, (2) individuals who engaged in consensual sodomy with minors. Because the citizen did not fit into either of these classes, he failed to demonstrate a palpable injury and did not qualify for standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Utah enticement statute was unconstitutional because it contained internal inconsistencies. Specifically, he contended that the statute imposed an inconsistent requirement on the State to both prove and disprove acts of attempt and solicitation. Defendant also asserted that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-4-401 was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court noted that when a statute could be construed in a reasonable manner so as to avoid unconstitutional inconsistency, courts would adopt that construction. The appellate court held that the &quot;not amounting to&quot; clause of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-4-401 could be reasonably understood to not require the State to affirmatively disprove attempt, conspiracy, and solicitation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants used an Internet chat room to contact an undercover police officer posing as a 13-year-old girl. The sexually suggestive conversation concluded with an agreement to meet at a park in Utah. They were arrested when they arrived at the agreed location. On appeal, they both challenged the Internet enticement statute on grounds that it included fatally inconsistent terms, imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, and was void for vagueness. Their challenge failed because the plain language of the statute did not require the State to affirmatively prove the absence of attempt, conspiracy, and solicitation, and even if it did require such proof, the statute did not require the State to prove and disprove the same elements because there were substantial differences between the crimes of attempt, conspiracy, solicitation, and Internet enticement. The elements of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-4-401 were distinct from other inchoate crimes and part of a reasonable statutory scheme to punish inchoate crimes according to their relative degree of completion. Defendants did not have standing to assert their Commerce Clause and vagueness challenges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims were both sexually abused by a priest. However, the abuse that was the subject of the complaint did not occur on church property or during church activities. Although the church received complaints that the priest had been sexually abusing children, it both failed to respond and actively concealed the abuse from its members and secular authorities. The victims filed a negligence action against the church. After a motion to dismiss was granted, the victims sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the church had no common law duty to warn the victims about the priest's prior acts of child sexual abuse because no special relationship existed between the church and either the victims or the priest. The priest was not a church employee, agent, or clergy member. Although the church conferred upon the priest the positions of high priest and scout leader, the sexual abuse suffered by the victims occurred in the priest's house and was unrelated to the church or any of its activities. Because there was no duty, none of the rest of the claims asserted by the victims were considered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth District Court, Provo Department, Utah, convicted defendant, pursuant to a guilty plea, of three counts of communications fraud. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the underlying statute, the communications fraud statute,&nbsp;Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-1801 (2003). Defendant argued that his challenge was not waived by his guilty plea. The appellate court noted that, because a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute directly cut to the power and authority of the court to determine the controversy, it was necessarily a jurisdictional matter and an unconditional guilty plea did not operate as a waiver of a facial constitutional challenge to a statute.&nbsp;Section 76-10-1801 drew the distinction between criminal and innocent behavior with a similar mens rea, and thus, it was not substantially overbroad. The statute did not prohibit all artful stratagems and tricks, only those meant to defraud others. The terms &quot;artifice&quot; and &quot;communicate&quot; were used with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people could understand what conduct was prohibited. Because defendant was charged with devising a scheme to defraud others of &quot;money,&quot; his actions did not fall within the &quot;anything of value&quot; realm, and he could not challenge the phrase as unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. One of the first questions the trial court asked after reading the information was whether there was anyone who, because of the nature of the case, believed that they would be unable to be fair and impartial. Five prospective jurors responded to the question, and none of them ended up on the jury panel. The trial court then asked the more narrow question of whether &quot;there was anyone else who either had been the victim of abuse or had had a family member or a close personal friend who had been the victim of abuse.&quot; Six more jurors responded affirmatively, and four that the trial court spoke to individually about their experiences did not serve on the jury. Two others did serve on the jury. Because the trial court did not fulfill its obligation to fully probe those jurors about their potential prejudice, the proceedings did not advance to the point at which a dispute arose over whether the trial court should have granted a challenge for cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate pleaded guilty to unlawful dealing with property by a fiduciary, failing to file a proper tax return, and theft. She later sought post-conviction relief, but the trial court denied her petition and found that she was informed by the lower court of her limited right to appeal, she was represented by competent counsel, and she had not been unconstitutionally denied her right to appeal. The court agreed and affirmed. The court held that a petitioner seeking to challenge the validity of a conviction was not able to circumvent the requirements of the Post-Conviction Remedies Act (PCRA), Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 78-35a-101 to -304 (2002), by styling a petition as one filed under Utah R. Civ. P. 65B(b) (2003). Rather, such petitioners had to proceed under the PCRA and Utah R. Civ. P. 65C (2003). The court clarified that Utah R. Civ. P. 65B(b) (2003) was really the successor rule to the writ of habeas corpus, while Utah R. Civ. P. 65C (2003) was the successor to the writ of error coram nobis. In this case, the lower court complied with Utah R. Crim. P. 11(e) and the inmate was not prevented from filing an appeal. The inmate failed to demonstrate that her attorney was deficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer sought to develop a subdivision in the county. The developer agreed to dedicate a 40-foot strip of land in anticipation of a county road being widened. The county, however, had determined that the developer must dedicate an additional 13-foot strip of land. The developer argued that increasing the dedication to 53 feet would alter several plots dramatically and would require reconfiguration of the subdivision at great expense. On appeal, the developer argued that the county's dedication requirement of 13 additional feet constituted an unconstitutional taking of its land without just compensation. Here, there was no evidence on whether the county's requirement of an additional 13 feet was a &quot;taking.&quot; The appellate court concluded that the district court was limited to the record made before the county and could determine only whether the county's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or illegal. The district court erred when it received evidence. The district court should have, instead, determined that the board, in the absence of an adequate factual record, acted arbitrarily and capriciously.

The court reversed and remanded, stating that it was clear that the trial court's reasonable doubt jury instruction failed to comport with the requirements of the three-part test that had been set forth by the Utah Supreme Court. The court noted that although the three-part test might be constitutionally flawed, it was not within its power to overrule it. Additionally, the court concluded that the trial court violated Utah R. Crim. P. 17(g)(6) when it failed to repeat the preliminary jury instructions that related to defendant's fundamental rights at the close of the evidence. However, in light of the evidence in the case, the short time between the preliminary instructions and the close of evidence, and the fact that the jurors were provided with written copies of all of the jury instructions, the court held that the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with felony driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) based on enhancement due to two prior DUI convictions. Defendant moved to dismiss, arguing that the enhancement provision in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6-44(6)(a)(i) (Supp. 2002) was unconstitutional as applied in violation of due process and the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The Seventh District, Castle Dale Department, Utah, denied his motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An enhanced sentence imposed on a persistent offender was not an additional penalty for the earlier crimes but was a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which was considered an aggravated offense because it was repetitive. The 2001 amendment to the DUI statute did not retroactively &quot;aggravate&quot; the crimes of the prior 1995 and 1998 DUIs, nor did it inflict a greater punishment than that attached to those crimes when they were committed. The amendment was effective April 30, 2001, and the current DUI offense was committed over a year later. The current conviction punished only the most recent offense, albeit more seriously than if he would have committed the same offense at an earlier point in time. The ex post facto challenge under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 failed. Any failure in 1995 to advise defendant under Utah Code Jud. Admin. R. 9-301 of the possibility of enhancement should he later be convicted again was a collateral and not a direct consequence of pleading guilty. It would have been impossible to advise him, in 1995, that the statute would be amended so that a third DUI conviction in 10 years would be charged as a third-degree felony. The due process argument failed.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that neither appellant had standing to contest the corporation's involuntary dissolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on the corporation's failure to file an annual report as required by Utah law, the Division declared the corporation delinquent. Due to the corporation's failure to respond or to file the required report, the corporation's corporate status was suspended and later dissolved. The corporation took no action during the following year to either file the required report or to appeal to the Division for reinstatement under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 16-10-88.2(5) (1991) (repealed). A full 10 years after its dissolution, the corporation petitioned the Division for a reinstatement of its corporate status. The Division denied this petition. The court held that the corporation's legal capacity to challenge its dissolution expired one year after the date of dissolution. Given that the action was not filed until more than 10 years after that date, the trial court was correct in dismissing the corporation's petition based on a lack of standing. The shareholder also lacked standing as he had not suffered any injury that was direct to his own person, property, or personal legal status, nor had he incurred a loss that would have been suffered irrespective of his status as a shareholder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed with defendant's argument that the term should be construed to include the confines of the prison, or the perimeter fence and all areas of the prison within the fence. The appellate court would eviscerate the crime of attempted escape if it considered any conduct by an inmate who moved to an area on prison grounds that was restricted or in which he was not supposed to be a completed escape. The prison had administrative rules for internally punishing inmates who moved into restricted areas.

Because defendant was not licensed, he was charged with several offenses. After he was convicted, defendant sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the trial court did not err when it precluded defendant from asserting a mistake of law defense under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-304(2)(b)(ii) (1999). The plain language of &sect; 76-2-304(2)(b)(ii) stated that defendant could have asserted the defense only if he relied upon a written interpretation of the law. Moreover, defendant was unable to assert an argument that the Act was an unconstitutional strict liability offense, as the issue was not presented to the trial court. The court noted that a violation of the Act was not a strict liability offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his victim were involved in a business dispute. Over a period of two years, defendant followed defendant with the purpose of intimidating her. Although he was prohibited from having contact with the victim, defendant appeared at her place of business. While there, defendant took a shotgun out of his trunk. Later, he was convicted of stalking. In affirming, the court determined that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the definition of &quot;use of a weapon.&quot; The weapon was used, despite the fact that it was never pointed at the victim, so long as exhibiting the weapon created a fear in the victim. Moreover, the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to arrest judgment, because there was sufficient evidence presented to show that defendant's conduct over the two-year period amounted to stalking. In addition, it was not necessary for the victim to see defendant take the gun out of his trunk, so long as a reasonable person in her position would have been frightened once she learned of the event. Finally, the court found that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-106.5 was not vague or overbroad when applied to defendant, based on his knowledge and conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District Court, Murray Department, Utah, granted judgment in favor of plaintiff city, convicting defendant lap dancers of violating the Sexually Oriented Business Ordinance, South Salt Lake City, Utah, Ordinances ch. 5.56, &sect; 5.56.240 (1999). The dancers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dancers argued that the city violated their due process rights when it altered its previously announced interpretation of the Sexually Oriented Business Ordinance, South Salt Lake City, Utah, Ordinances ch. 5.56, &sect; 5.56.240 (1999), and enforced that change without first providing defendants notice. The appellate court had jurisdiction over the matter, because the trial court ruled on the constitutionality of the ordinance. The appellate court found that the trial court unnecessarily restricted the scope of a prior case in ruling on the ordinance. The core idea expressed in the prior case was that fair notice was essential to the constitutional enforcement of a law. The dancers provided evidence of the clubs' participation in the drafting and interpretation of the ordinance. The dancers also provided the testimony of two police officers who would have testified that the dancers were in compliance with the previous interpretation of the ordinance. Because a determination of whether the dancers' due process rights were violated was fact-intensive, without factual findings, the appellate court could not conduct a meaningful review of the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the ruling that the State presented sufficient evidence to convict him of the felony counts and to conclude that he had violated his abeyance agreement. The appellate court found that there was nothing ambiguous about the terms &quot;contacting,&quot; &quot;otherwise communicating,&quot; &quot;directly,&quot; or &quot;indirectly&quot; in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 30-6-4.2(2)(b) such as to warrant construing them to mean something other than their common and accepted meaning. The statute expressly prohibited harassing contact and &sect; 30-6-4.2(2)(a) prohibited threats of abuse or violence. The evidence was sufficient such that the jury could reasonably infer that the letters sent by defendant were an attempt to communicate with his wife in violation of the protection order. The appellate court declined to address defendant's vagueness claim on appeal because defendant made no argument as to plain error or exceptional circumstances.  Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 30-6-4.2, 76-4-108, were not impermissibly overbroad because they were narrowly drafted to burden no more speech than necessary to serve a significant government interest. The statutes did not prohibit innocent communication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional on its face.

Although defendant attempted to distinguish this case from the In case by arguing that the In case only addressed the constitutionality of the statute as it applied to use, as opposed to mere possession of a firearm by a restricted person, the instant court pointed out that its conclusion in the In case simply stated that the restrictions contained in the statute did not unconstitutionally interfere with one's right to bear arms, and made no distinction between use and possession. Because the In case made no distinction between use and possession, its conclusion that the statute was constitutional applied both to restrictions on possession and to restrictions on use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held, among other things, that the landowners did not properly invoke the trial court's jurisdiction, pursuant to The Utah Governmental Immunity Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect;63-30-1 t0 -38 (1997). On appeal, the landowners argued that the trial court's holding was in error, because the notice requirements of the Governmental Immunity Act did not apply, as the provisions for interest on the value of property in Utah Const. art. I, &sect;22 were self-executing. The appellate court rejected the landowners' arguments. The funds in question were deposited by the state department of transportation, and, as a result, the landowners had no property interest in the interest accrued on the deposited funds. Therefore, the landowners' action was a new proceeding, rather than arising out of a prior one, and thus the action had to comply with the Governmental Immunity Act to properly invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court. The landowners did not file their notice of claim with the attorney general, and the state agency against which the landowners intended to bring the claim. Thus, they did not comply with the notice requirement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that he met all the criteria required by the probation statute, including the requirement that he had been accepted for mental health treatment in a residential sexual abuse treatment center that has been approved by the Utah Department of Corrections under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-406.5(1)(h). The trial court made a finding of fact at sentencing that defendant did not comply with the mandated terms of the statute because the adult probation and parole report stated defendant had been accepted for treatment but not in a residential program. Thus, defendant misstated the evidence. Defendant failed to meet his burden of showing he met the statutory requirements by a preponderance of the evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged imposition of the group crime sentence enhancement, arguing he was improperly subjected to &sect; 76-3-203.1 (1995), which provided for a mandatory minimum sentence when the elements of the group crime sentence enhancement were proved. While defendant's appeal was pending, the Supreme Court of Utah in State v. Lopes, 1999 UT 24, 980 P.2d 191, held that &sect; 76-3-203.1(5)(c) was unconstitutional. Thus, under Lopes, imposition of either type of sentence enhancement required that the relevant facts be found by the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court held that defendant rightly argued that application of Lopes to his case would render the trial court's imposition of the gang enhancement, without a finding of the relevant elements by the jury upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt, in error. However, the court concluded that the error was harmless. The jury could not have returned the verdicts it did on the other questions submitted to it without having also &quot;found&quot; the particular element necessary for imposition of the group crime enhancement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employee filed a workers' compensation claim and an administrative law judge (ALJ) awarded permanent total disability (PTD) benefits and rejected the reemployment plan of appellants, employer and insurer (employer). The employer moved the Appeals Board to review the compensation plan. The Appeals Board reduced the employee's benefits by $ 9 per week but otherwise affirmed the ruling. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured at work. An ALJ awarded temporary total disability benefits and reserved a ruling on permanent partial and PTD until the employee reached medical stability. The ALJ then concluded the employee was tentatively PTD, ordered the employer to pay subsistence, allowed the employer to submit a reemployment plan and request a hearing. A second ALJ rejected the reemployment plan and entered a final award of PTD. The Appeals Board (Board) found the reemployment plan did not provide for education, training, or other items and approved its rejection. The appellate court held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 35-1-67 (1994) granted the Board the authority to &quot;review&quot; the plan which meant it could independently evaluate and approve the plan. Section 35-1-67 was not unconstitutional simply because it did not mandate additional hearings or require specific time lines, because the statute allowed for numerous evidentiary hearings to take place, the Board maintained jurisdiction to cure defects, and a party had the ability to challenge a specific result. Section 35-1-67 was not unconstitutional merely because it did not provide a way for an employer to recoup overpayments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order that the reemployment plan was not reasonable was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff corporation owned residential property and filed a complaint in the Third District Court for Coalville County (Utah) against the defendant Summit County Commission, Board of Equalization, assessor, and treasurer (Board) that requested the residential property tax rate reduction provided in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-103(2) (2000). The board moved for summary judgment, which was granted. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 59-2-103(2) provided for a reduction of 45 percent from the fair market value of residential property, representing a residential exemption allowed under Utah Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2. Despite use of the corporation's property as a full-time residence, taxes on the property from 1992 through 1996 were based on 100 percent of its fair market value. An application to qualify for the primary residence exemption was not made and filed by the corporation until 1997. The appellate court held that because the company failed to submit an application or otherwise conform with the requirements of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-2-1102(3) (2000) the company's property did not qualify for the residential exemption for the years prior to the application being made. The protest letters that the company sent with each tax payment did not conform to &sect; 59-2-1102(3) requirements. Title to the property was held in a corporate name; property tax assessments were sent to the law offices of the corporation's counsel. That information, which was all that was immediately known to the board, did nothing to suggest residential use of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State filed a petition alleging appellant mother caused the death of her infant son and that her older son was a sibling at risk. The Third District Juvenile, Salt Lake Department, Utah, entered a decision finding the mother responsible for her infant son's death and finding the older son to be a sibling at risk. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that requiring the mother to participate in and defend herself in multiple proceedings did not violate her due process rights. The court of appeals did not address whether the mother's choice to exercise her right not to testify in one proceeding led to the deprivation of any other right because the mother failed to properly brief that issue. The juvenile court properly ordered the father to obtain separate counsel because of a conflict of interest. The mother had access to court-appointed counsel if she could not afford an attorney. Therefore, her due process rights were protected. The mother did not present case law or analysis to support her argument that financial hardship, alone, deprived her of due process. Principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel had no application to the proceedings.  Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-3a-308(2) (Supp. 2000) was mandatory insofar as it directed juvenile courts to promptly adjudicate juvenile matters. The statute was not jurisdictional, however, and the failure of the juvenile court to hold the adjudicative hearing within 60 days of the shelter hearing did not divest the juvenile court of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the lower court was reversed, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The judgment creditor began foreclosure, and the lender sought an injunction and a declaration of lien priority. The lender appealed the trial court's determination. The appellate court held that the lender's lien was not a purchase money mortgage. Therefore, lien priority was based on the first-in-time rule. The homestead was first, followed by the judgment creditor, and the lender. Equity was inapplicable since there was no fraud or mistake. The refinance proceeds were not part of the sale.

The juvenile court concluded that the juvenile assaulted the female student when he hit her with snowballs. The juvenile court further concluded that the juvenile committed a hate crime because he assaulted the female student with the intent to cause her to fear to freely exercise or enjoy her right to be on the school grounds to pursue an education. The juvenile argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for assault and the enhancement of the assault to a third degree assault under &sect; 76-3-203.3. The instant court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to convict the juvenile of assault.

Next, the court of appeals held that the State had reasonable cause to believe that there was a violation of the state antitrust laws because the State produced some objective evidence indicating the possibility of an agreement that unreasonably restrained trade.

The trial court properly ruled that Child was not &quot;placed for adoption&quot; until the petition was filed in the proper court. Because Child was over six months old and Father had developed a substantial relationship with her, the Adoption Statute required Appellants to give Father notice. Appellants failed to give him notice; therefore, the adoption was not final as to Father and he is entitled to contest the adoption.  <BR></SPAN></P>

The Second District Court, Davis County, Utah, held that the grandmother's adoption of the child did not terminate the father's parental rights.

Grandmother did not give father notice of the adoption proceedings. The appellate court found that: (1) mother, grandmother, and child were not denied due process because they had sufficient notice that compliance with the adoption statutes was at issue, (2) the child was not &quot;placed for adoption&quot; until the petition was filed in the proper court, (3) the statutes required that father had to be given notice, and notice was not given, and (4) the adoption was not final as to father, and he was entitled to contest the adoption.</SPAN></P>

Code R. 865-19S-33, 865-19S-62, appellee directed that amounts paid for annual memberships to discount club vendors were taxable. Appellants were members of two discount clubs and paid sales tax on their annual membership fees. Appellants filed a declaratory judgment action to challenge the legality of those rules. The trial court dismissed the complaint after deciding it did not have subject matter jurisdiction because appellee did not have an opportunity to decide the matter prior to appellants filing suit in district court. The court of appeals reversed. The trial court erroneously dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. District court review was constitutionally valid, and appellants were not required to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

One week later defendant was involved in another shootout. Defendant was subsequently charged with possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-10-503(3)(a)(i) (Supp. 1997). On appeal, he argued he was not a &quot;restricted person&quot; as defined in &sect; 76-10-503(3)(a)(i), because, although he had pleaded guilty to a prior felony at the time of this offense, he had not been sentenced on that prior felony. He also raised due process concerns. Rejecting his contentions, the court affirmed. Defendant's status as a restricted person was based solely on his prior guilty plea to a third degree felony. His due process rights were not violated because the statute gave adequate notice, it was not susceptible to arbitrary enforcement, and it did not interfere with his right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was charged with one count of rape in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-402 (1999), and alternatively, with one count of unlawful sexual activity with a minor in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-401(2)(a) (1999). The 19-year old defendant had sexual intercourse with a 15-year old girl. Defendant filed a motion in limine, seeking a determination that unlawful sexual activity with a minor was not a strict liability crime. Defendant also requested permission to introduce evidence he was reasonably mistaken as to the victim's age. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant pled guilty to the unlawful sexual activity with a minor charge. He appealed the trial court's ruling that the crime was a strict liability offense and also challenged the statute's constitutionality. The court affirmed. The court held the statute defining the offense clearly indicated a legislative purpose to impose criminal responsibility for committing the prohibited act without requiring proof of any culpable mental state. The court also held the statute was constitutional because it rationally furthered the legitimate governmental activity of protecting children from sexual abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because unlawful sexual activity with a minor was a strict liability offense; thus, the State was not required to prove that defendant was mistaken about the minor's age as defendant was not allowed to offer such evidence and unlawful sexual activity with a minor statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. Pertaining to the time restriction applicable for establishment of a valid common law marriage, the court held that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 30-1-4.5 required only the filing of a petition for adjudication of marriage within one year after the termination of the relationship, such that establishment of a common law marriage was not untimely in the case. However, the trial court erred in modifying the first divorce decree because there was no substantial change of circumstances, as remarriage and/or failure to make support payments could not alone constitute a substantial change of circumstances. The evidence supported the contempt finding.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged and convicted of a violation of disorderly conduct under Salt Lake City, Utah, Code &sect; 11.16.100. On appeal the court affirmed in part. Although the language of &sect; 11.16.100 did not mirror the state statute governing lewdness, the ordinance was valid because their common purpose was to prohibit sexual behavior in places where the public may be affronted or offended, and the ordinance did not conflict with state law. The facts were sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant &quot;engaged in sexual conduct&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 11.16.100(C).

Appellant challenged the finding, arguing that the language of &sect; 76-9-702 (1999) was unconstitutionally vague because it did not sufficiently describe the prohibited conduct. Upon review, judgment was reversed. Though appellant's gestures were immature and offensive, they did not amount to masturbation, and so were not lewd under &sect; 76-9-702 (1999). Furthermore, after applying the doctrine of ejusdem generis, the statutory language was not unconstitutionally vague.

On appeal defendant contended the evidence was insufficient to show that his telephone message was lewd, lascivious, or profane, and that the telephone harassment statute,&nbsp;&sect; 76-9-201, was unconstitutionally overbroad, both on its face and as applied, and was void for vagueness. The court agreed with defendant as to the statute's overbreadth with respect to subparts (a) and (d), the two parts which applied to defendant's prosecution, did not address the constitutionality of subsections (b), (c), or (e), and did not reach defendant's remaining issues, holding that the overbreadth of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-9-201(a) and (d) (1999) was real and substantial, as these subsections swept within their ambit other activities that in ordinary circumstances constituted the exercise of free speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant scratched a four-letter obscenity into a jail cell door. Defendant was charged with damaging a jail in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-8-418 (1999). The district court granted defendant's motion to quash and dismissed the charge. The State appealed, contending scratches constituted damage within the meaning of the phrase &quot; or otherwise damages any public jail&quot; in &sect; 76-8-418. Defendant argued the use of the disjunctive in combination with term &quot;otherwise&quot; was taken as indicative of an intent to proscribe conduct of the same gravity, and that scratching did not equate to pulling down, flooding, or destroying a jail. The court disagreed, holding the use of the doctrine of ejusdem generis was not appropriate to restrict the meaning of an unambiguous term, that the term &quot;damage&quot; was not vague or ambiguous in &sect; 76-8-418, and that damage to a jail therefore encompassed damage of any sort.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer applied for rezoning land to neighborhood commercial use. Appellee city planning commission recommended approval. After a hearing with much public concern, appellee city council denied appellant's requested zoning reclassification and appellant filed an appeal. Summary judgment in favor of appellee was granted because its action was not arbitrary, capricious or illegal. Appellant, arguing the &quot;reasonably debatable&quot; standard of review was incorrectly relied on instead of the substantial evidence standard, appealed. The court affirmed, holding that appellee properly applied the &quot;reasonably debatable&quot; standard of review because zoning was a legislative action; appellee had wide discretion; and its decision was endowed with a presumption of validity unless it clearly appeared to go beyond its power or was unjustly discriminatory. The court also held that appellee was not required to disregard the concerns of its electorate - or its own concerns - when performing in a legislative capacity.</SPAN></P>
