</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and aggravated criminal sexual assault, and was sentenced to death. Defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief, at which the issue of defendant's fitness to participate in post-conviction proceedings was raised. The circuit court denied the petition, and defendant appealed. The court held that once a bona fide doubt of a defendant's fitness to proceed with a post-conviction petition was raised, the burden was on the State to prove the defendant was fit. The court held defendant raised a bona fide doubt of his fitness. The court held the circuit court misallocated the burden of proof. The circuit court agreed with the parties that the burden of proving lack of fitness was on defendant. The court held defendant did not waive the issue, as the proceedings were under an erroneous view of the law. The court held the misallocation of the burden of proof was not harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the denial of defendant's petition for post-conviction relief and remanded for further proceedings, because the circuit court erred in allocating the burden of proof at the hearing to determine defendant's fitness to proceed with post-conviction proceedings to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of less of cocaine. 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-15 (West 1998) allowed the state to use lab reports instead of testimony as prima facie evidence of the substance unless the defendant demanded the testimony of the witness who prepared the report within seven days of receipt of the report. The statute was unconstitutional under the confrontation clauses of the United States and Illinois Constitutions. It impermissibly required the defendant to take a procedural step to secure his confrontation rights or be deemed to have waived them, and did not require the waiver of this fundamental constitutional right be a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary act. The court held the state failed to satisfy its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

Statute allowing state to use lab reports instead of testimony as evidence of substances violated rights to compulsory process.

The court reversed in part, holding that the act had already been declared unconstitutional in its entirety, and respondent was no longer subject to a mandatory sentencing requirement. Therefore, appellee was unquestionably not similarly situated to habitual and violent juvenile offenders. The court affirmed that appellee's confession was voluntary and admissible, as appellee's detention was valid, the authorities repeatedly informed appellee of his Miranda rights, and no physical coercion or threats or promises occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jo Daviess County (Illinois), which dismissed six cases against various appellees on grounds that Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/15-111 (West 1998), a statute regulating weights and loads of vehicles operating upon Illinois highways, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee truck drivers were all charged with violating the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/15-111 (West 1998) after the gross weight of each of their trucks exceeded the statutory limit. The trial court held that &sect; 15-111 was constitutionally infirm in all of its applications, violative of due process, and void for vagueness. The trial court found the sheer volume of &sect; 15-111 was one of the factors that rendered it unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the sheer volume of the statute may have made it tedious to read, but it was not its role to rewrite the statute according to its preferences. The court found that &sect; 15-111 was constitutional because it was comprehensible and provided fair notice of what was prohibited. Section &sect; 15-111 also provided clear standards for enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded. The relevant statute was constitutional because it provided each of appellees due notice, gave them fair warning of what was prohibited, and explicit standards for those engaged in enforcement. The statute did not contain any inconsistent terminology or terms that could not be easily discerned.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion for post-conviction relief, filed pursuant to the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1 et seq. (West 1994), was dismissed. The court held that defendant's claim that he was denied due process when he did not receive a fitness hearing under 5/104-21(a) was not a proper basis for post-conviction relief because it was a statutory, not a constitutional, claim. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel for trial counsel's failure to request a fitness hearing because there was no reasonable probability that defendant would have been found unfit. Defendant failed to show that trial counsel acted under a conflict of interest because it was clear he was retained to represent defendant, and counsel's decision not to call defendant's girlfriend as a defense witness was based on her decision to invoke U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Illinois), which affirmed a decision of the trial court finding defendant guilty of home invasion and aggravated criminal sexual assault. Trial court also had denied defendant's motion to dismiss, on speedy-trial grounds, the aggravated criminal sexual assault charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with home invasion after he entered his ex-wife's dwelling, without authority, struck her on the head with a gun, and sexually assaulted her. Subsequently, the State filed an amended criminal information, which contained the original home invasion charge along with five charges of aggravated criminal sexual assault. Defendant moved to dismiss the new charges, arguing the State did not bring him to trial on those charges within 120 days of his arrest, as statutorily mandated. The motion was denied and defendant was convicted of home invasion and one count of aggravated criminal sexual assault. Judgment affirmed. Because the State was not required to join the offenses, the speedy-trial term applicable to the home invasion charge was inapplicable to the sexual assault charges. Defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated because he was tried on the sexual assault charges within 30 days of their being filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Home invasion and sexual assault charges were based on separate acts; therefore, compulsory joinder statute did not require State to prosecute both offenses in same proceeding. Defendant received speedy trial with respect to sexual assault charges because those charges were brought within 30 days after they were filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant debtors appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Illinois), which reversed the dismissal of appellee creditor's complaint that sought to have a conveyance made between appellants set aside as fraudulent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee creditor filed a lawsuit against appellants to set aside appellant husband's conveyance of title to both himself and appellant wife, as tenants by the entirety, which appellee claimed was fraudulent under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA), 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 160/1 et seq. (West 1996). The trial court granted appellants' motion to dismiss appellee's complaint. The lower appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court held that the UFTA's actual intent standard could not be used to set aside a transfer of property in tenancy by the entirety. Rather, the sole intent standard of an amended tenancy by the entirety statutory provision applied. Appellee could amend its complaint to reflect the sole intent standard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the appellate court affirmed. Appellee creditor's complaint was to be dismissed but without prejudice, thereby allowing appellee to amend its complaint to reflect the amendment to a statutory tenancy by the entirety provision. The amended provision implemented a sole intent standard rather than the actual intent standard of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act to determine whether a transfer could be avoided as fraudulent.</SPAN></P>

A jury imposed the death sentence. Defendant appealed, alleging that due to errors at the guilt and sentencing phases he was entitled to a new trial or, in the alternative, to a new sentencing hearing. Reversing and remanding, the court held that the use of the police uniform as evidence was prejudicial, state's rebuttal closing argument regarding the victim's family and supporting the police were not probative of defendant's guilt, and testimony by prosecutors was improper. All these errors were cumulative errors that deprived defendant of his due process right to a fair trial in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was a prison inmate about to be released. Appellant state filed a petition under the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act (the Act), 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 207/1 et seq. (West 1998), alleging that appellee was a sexually violent person. Before the trial, the circuit court dismissed appellant's petition on appellee's motion, holding that the Act was unconstitutional. The Illinois Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the Act did not contravene the prohibition against double jeopardy nor violate ex post facto principles; the fact that juries were not available on petitions for conditional release or discharge did not render the legislation infirm under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 13; under rational basis analysis, statutory proceedings under the Act were civil rather than criminal in nature, and it was not irrational for the legislature to treat civil litigants different from criminal ones; and appellee failed to present any authority to support a finding that due process was violated.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 5/25-1(a)(2) (West 1996), a subsection of the mob action statute prohibiting the assembly of two or more persons to do an unlawful act. The same statute had been previously declared unconstitutional by a federal district court. After a hearing, the circuit court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, holding that the statute violated U.S. Const. amend. I and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Illinois Supreme Court, on direct review, affirmed, concluding that the attempt by appellant to relitigate the viability of the statute constituted an impermissible collateral attack on the federal court's judgment, and that if appellant sought relief from that judgment, its recourse was with the federal courts, not the courts of Illinois. Until the federal courts modified or dissolved the injunction, the courts of Illinois could permit the State to prosecute defendants in violation of the injunction's commands.</SPAN></P>

There was nothing arbitrary or unreasonable in the legislature's use of the police power to protect those citizens most vulnerable and in need of protection.

Const. art. IX, &sect; 6's exclusive use language was not fatal, as it was construed to be constitutional, construing it in pari materia with 35 ILCS 200/15-65(a) (2012) added a public charity requirement, it created no ipso facto exemption, and it could not be said a hospital meeting the statute could not be constitutionally granted an exemption.</SPAN></P>

R. 304(b)(5), the October 6 order, which granted the contempt finding and sanctions in an amount to be determined, was not an appealable order because the trial court had not yet imposed a monetary penalty for the sanctions. Thus, the October 17 notice of appeal was premature and did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction; [3]-Although the owner and attorney invited the appellate court to divide the October 6 order into its component parts, the two penalties stemmed from the same factual circumstances, the owner's failure to answer questions.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-735 ILCS 5/13-214.3(d) governed the case because the allegedly negligent legal services were rendered to the decedent and not to the beneficiary of the decedent's trust. Therefore, the attorney malpractice claim by the beneficiary was time-barred because it was not filed within two years of the decedent's death; [2]-Even if &sect; 13-214.3(d) was not applicable, the beneficiary's action was time-barred under the statute of repose contained in 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3(c) (1994).</SPAN></P>

The sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing because the repetition of the improper factor, coupled with the fact that the trial court also said that the charges reflected negatively on defendant, lead the court to conclude that the charges likely played more than a minimal role in sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Respondent only challenged the guilty plea after he was faced with a new, harsher sentence for his subsequent conduct after the plea; [2]-Respondent's challenge to the HJO and VJO mandatory sentencing provisions was rejected.

Accordingly, the appellate court reversed and remanded for a retroactive fitness hearing; [2]-The trial court properly imposed two firearm enhancements under 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)(1)(C) (2006), regardless of whether defendant was only accountable for the attempted murder of one victim.

(1992), and the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine did not apply; [2]-Foster parents were not entitled to sanctions because Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 137(a), (c) sanctions were not applicable, and under Ill. Admin. Code tit. 89, &sect; 337.30(b)(1)-(2), (c)(5), (8), the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services was permitted to immediately remove the child without timely notice based on its determination that he was at imminent risk of harm and had a proper legal basis for opposing the foster parents' requests for an emergency review.</SPAN></P>

VIII because the fact that the fine had increased over time did not create a constitutional issue, and the circumstance that the vehicle was worth less than the fixed penalty did not change an otherwise facially valid penalty into an unconstitutionally excessive fine, as the penalty was uniformly imposed as a result of prohibited conduct and was unrelated to the value of the vehicle in which the conduct occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The plain language of 720 ILCS 5/33A-2 (2010) prohibited predicating armed violence on any part of the aggravated battery statute,&nbsp;720 ILCS 5/12-4(a) (2010), as it excluded any offense which made the use of a dangerous weapon either an element of the base offense or an aggravated or enhanced version of the offense; [2]-Defendant was also convicted of aggravated battery with a firearm based on the same event, and it would be patently unreasonable to conclude that the prosecution could both charge defendant with an enhanced version of an offense and then also predicate an armed violence charge on a subsection of that same offense that did not specifically address weapons; [3]-Defendant's claims regarding his trial counsel fell under one or both prongs of Strickland, and he failed to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the alleged failures of counsel.</SPAN></P>
