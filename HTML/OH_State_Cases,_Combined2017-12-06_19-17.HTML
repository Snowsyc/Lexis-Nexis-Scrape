<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a decedent's estate administratrix in her administrative and individual capacities, sought review of a judgment from the Lawrence County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which dismissed her claims against appellees, asbestos-related (AR) entities, in the administratrix's multi-count action, seeking recovery for alleged AR injuries sustained by the decedent. They were dismissed based on failure to meet the requirement of R.C. &sect; 2307.92.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the administratrix's motions to prove a prima facie case under R.C. ch. 2307 and to set the matter for trial. Upon finding that she had not met the prima facie standard of R.C. &sect; 2307.92, the trial court administratively dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court found that the trial court had properly determined that H.B. 292, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2004) (codified at R.C. ch. 2307) was not unconstitutionally retroactive generally, as it prohibited its application if such would result in unconstitutional retroactivity in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, based on its own savings provision under R.C. &sect; 2307.93(A)(3)(a). In determining whether application of R.C. ch. 2307 to the administratrix's case was unconstitutionally retroactive, the court noted that the legislature had expressly intended retroactive application. Further, it found that as ch. 2307 imposed a new, more difficult statutory standard upon the administratrix's ability to maintain the claims compared with the prior, potentially viable common law cause of action, it was a substantive rather than remedial law. The court concluded that its application would be unconstitutionally retroactive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for an evaluation of the adminstratrix's causes of action under Ohio common law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants taxpayers sued appellee taxing official, and others, in the Summit Count Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for declaratory judgment, permanent injunction, and recovery of illegally collected real estate taxes. The trial court granted the official's motion to dismiss the taxpayers' complaint for failure to state a claim under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6). The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ohio Supreme Court had held certain school finance statutes unconstitutional for violating the mandate of a &quot;thorough and efficient&quot; public school system, in Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, and the legislature was given a year to enact corrective legislation, which was extended. The appellate court held this decision did not intend to reduce or eliminate property taxes for public schools, although reliance on these taxes was criticized. The state had to look to additional funding sources in addition to, and not instead of, these taxes. The Supreme Court held, on reconsideration, property taxes could fund a school system, but could not be the primary financing means. The year allowed to enact corrective legislation did not mean property taxes were lowered if such legislation was not enacted within that period. Voted property taxes for schools, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 5707, were not implicitly found unconstitutional as the statute was presumed constitutional, and the Supreme Court did not explicitly find it unconstitutional. There was no support for the argument that, if corrective legislation was not enacted, their property taxes for schools were reduced to 10 mills.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant asbestos-injury claimant sought review of a judgment from the Lawrence County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which administratively dismissed his multi-count complaint against appellee asbestos-related entities pursuant to R.C. &sect; 2307.93(C), wherein the claimant sought recovery for unspecified asbestos-related injuries. His complaint was filed prior to the effective date of H.B. 292, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2004) (codified at R.C. ch. 2307).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant alleged that his colon cancer was not diagnosed until after the effective date of H.B. 292, although his asbestosis was diagnosed beforehand. The trial court dismissed the action. On review, the court found that the legislation generally was not unconstitutionally retroactive under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, as it contained its own &quot;savings clause&quot; under R.C. &sect; 2307.93(A)(3)(a). Application of R.C. ch. 2307 to the colon cancer claims was not unconstitutionally retroactive, as the claimant had no expectation or vested right for adjudication under pre-H.B. 292 law. However, colon cancer was not covered by the legislation. As to his asbestosis claim, application of the legislation would have been unconstitutionally retroactive, as it was a substantive rather than remedial law, and it imposed a more stringent standard of proof. Accordingly, the potentially viable common law claim could be removed. Use of the definition of &quot;competent medical authority&quot; under R.C. &sect; 2307.91(Z) to determine whether the claimant's cause of action accrued under R.C. &sect; 2305.10 was error, and the standard under R.C. &sect; 2307.93(B) should have been employed for the challenge to the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter for evaluation of the claimant's causes of action under Ohio common law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to one count of attempted rape and three counts of kidnapping, offenses arising from an incident involving three young boys. While appellant was still incarcerated for the convictions, the court of common pleas conducted a hearing to determine whether appellant should be adjudicated a &quot;sexual predator,&quot; pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950. The lower court ultimately determined that the state had proven by clear and convincing evidence that appellant was a sexual predator. Appellant brought an appeal to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The appellate court found that the registration, verification, and notification provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 were not unconstitutional under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;1. The provisions of the statute were not unreasonable or arbitrary, and were valid police power legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violations of &sect; 1252.17 for floodlights and exterior lights as well as projection into yards.

Prior to a ruling thereon, the city filed a second charge against defendant for another alleged violation of &sect; 1252.17. The trial court found that &sect; 1252.17 was unconstitutional and accordingly, it dismissed both complaints against defendant. On appeal by the city, the court noted that the ordinance did not define &quot;open source of light,&quot; which vagueness could have caused persons to guess at its meaning. The court also agreed with the trial court's determination that even porch lights could have been deemed to be in violation of &sect; 1252.17 as written.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Portage County (Ohio), convicting him of improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle, in violation of R.C. 2923.16(B). Defendant alleged that the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss the indictment because &sect; 2923.16(B) violated his right to bear arms embodied in U.S. Const. amend. II and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a West Virginia resident, was operating a motor vehicle in Ohio when he was stopped by a police officer for a traffic violation. When the officer approached the vehicle, defendant told the officer that he had a loaded.22 caliber handgun on the floorboard beneath his feet. Defendant did not have a license to carry a concealed handgun in Ohio. While he once had a concealed carry permit from West Virginia, the permit had expired. Section 2923.16(B), which prohibited transporting a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle if it was accessible to the operator without leaving the vehicle, was facially constitutional and did not infringe defendant's right to bear arms embodied in U.S. Const. amend. II and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 4 because neither constitutional provision granted a citizen an absolute right to carry a loaded firearm in one's vehicle. With regard to the as applied analysis, the intermediate standard of review was appropriate. Section 2923.16(B) was narrowly tailored to promote public safety, did not prohibit possession of a loaded firearm outside motor vehicles, and did not completely prohibit having or transporting loaded firearms in a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a deceased worker's family members, sued, inter alia, appellant manufacturer, in the Warren County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for products liability. The trial court denied the manufacturer's summary judgment motion, after finding R.C. 2125.02(D)(2)(a), a statute of repose, violated the right to remedy clause of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The manufacturer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer said it was error to find R.C. 2125.02(D)(2)(a)&nbsp;unconstitutional under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The appellate court agreed. The trial court held, absent further analysis, that the statute violated the right to remedy clause. The court's opinion did not show the statute and the constitutional provision were incompatible beyond a reasonable doubt, nor did it give the general assembly legislative deference before finding the statute unconstitutional. In addition, after it issued its decision, the Ohio Supreme Court, in another case, overruled an argument that another products liability statute of repose was unconstitutional for the same reason. The right to remedy provision in art. I, &sect; 16 only applied to existing, vested, rights, and state law determined what remedies were available. When the legislature created a remedy in products liability cases, it also had the power to impose limitations on the remedy, including a requirement that an action be brought within ten years of the delivery of the manufacturer's allegedly defective product, and this did not leave the family members without any remedy, as redress could be sought from the employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision was reversed, and the matter was remanded for further consideration of the merits of the manufacturer's summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee wife sued appellants, a doctor and a physician's group, for medical malpractice and wrongful death. The Warren County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted summary judgment for appellants on the wrongful death claim but overruled the motion as to medical malpractice, finding that R.C. 2305.113(C), Ohio's statute of repose for medical malpractice, was unconstitutional as applied to the wife. Appellants filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argue that the trial court erred in finding that the statute of repose contained in R.C. 2305.113(C) was unconstitutional as applied to appellee. The appellate court held that the matter was a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(6). Further, the trial court properly found that Ohio's current statute of repose for medical malpractice claims contained in R.C. 2305.113(C) was unconstitutional as applied to the wife because it barred her claim after it had already vested, but before she or the decedent knew or reasonably could have known about the claim. That was a violation of the right-to-a-remedy provision of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The decedent had lab work performed by the doctor in 1995, 1997, and 1998, all of which showed that he had elevated liver enzyme levels. The doctor did not notify the decent of the abnormalities. In 2008, the decedent was diagnosed with liver cancer. He died in 2009.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, taxpayers, chief of police and mayors, appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Sandusky County that granted a writ of mandamus to compel appellees, a county board of commissioners and a county board of elections, to hold a special election before January 1, 2013, to elect a judge for the newly created municipal court, for a one-year term and for an election for a full six-year term to be held in November 2013.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In June 2012, the General Assembly enacted 2012 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 509 (H.B. 509), which abolished the county court and established the county municipal court. Appellants sought a declaratory judgment holding H.B. 509 to be unconstitutional, a writ of prohibition to prevent the county board of commissioners from expending funds for the municipal court created by H.B. 509, and a writ of mandamus to order the county board of elections to accept petitions for the office of judge of the county court and to hold an election in November 2012, which was the regular election cycle for the county court. The supreme court found that the court of appeals correctly held that H.B. 509 was unconstitutional insofar as it appointed judges of the county court to the newly created county municipal court for 2013. The court of appeals erred, however, in granting a writ of mandamus to compel appellees to conduct a special election for judge of the county municipal court for a one-year term in 2013. Appellants established their entitlement to a writ of mandamus to compel appellees to conduct the November 6, 2012 election for the two part-time judgeships for the county court.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the finding that he was delinquent. Appellant first contended Canton, Ohio, Ordinance 537.14 was void as unconstitutional, vague, and overbroad. The court agreed, finding the ordinance unconstitutional pursuant to the vagueness doctrine. The court found that the ordinance did not provide sufficient notice of its proscriptions and contained no reasonably clear guidelines to prevent official arbitrariness or discrimination in its enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs workers' compensation claimants sought declaratory relief against defendant Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC). The claimants moved for a finding that R.C. &sect;&sect; 4123.93 and 4123.931 are unconstitutional. The BWC moved for judgment on the pleadings with regard to the claimants' request for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Former R.C. &sect; 4123.931 created an unconstitutional taking without compensation when a workers' compensation claimant had to give a statutory subrogee the estimated value of future benefits even though the claimant might never receive those benefits. The current statute did not require a claimant to reimburse a subrogee for benefits that were not received. A claimant could set up an interest-bearing trust account from which to pay a subrogee's subrogation interest in any future benefit payments actually received. R.C. &sect; 4123.931(F), governing claimants who did not create such accounts, unconstitutionally required a claimant to give a subrogee estimated future payments, creating the situation previously rejected as creating an uncompensated taking. Section 4123.931(F) was severable from the rest of the statute because severance did not defeat legislative intent. R.C. &sect; 4123.931 no longer violated equal protection by distinguishing between claimants settling claims against third-party tortfeasors and those who did not because the formula in R.C. &sect; 4123.931(B) and (D), under which a subrogee's interest was calculated, applied to both categories of claimants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants' motion was granted in part and denied in part because R.C. &sect; 4123.931(F) was found to be unconstitutional but the rest of the statute was not. The BWC's motion for judgment on the pleadings was, as a result, granted in part and denied in part.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2923.16(B) prohibited transporting a gun by way of a motor vehicle that could be accessed by the driver or passenger without getting out of the vehicle. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.16(C) specified how a gun was to be transported in a motor vehicle. Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 4, which gave the right to bear arms, did not prohibit Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12. The general assembly determined that prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons helped to maintain an orderly and safe society. The goal and the means used to attain it were reasonable. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12 did not unconstitutionally infringe on the right to bear arms, because there was no constitutional right to bear concealed weapons. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2923.12, .16 were not void for vagueness.

The section provided that the Director could accept for review a certificate of need application for the relocation of up to 24 existing nursing home beds in Jackson County to Gallia County. In reversing the Director's decision to approve the relocation, the court held that the section was unconstitutional because it violated the Uniformity Clause contained in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. The court held that the section was a law of a general nature and did not operate in a uniform manner within the meaning of the Uniformity Clause because it did not have the potential to apply to any county in the state or any other nursing home operators other than the operator. The court also held that the section was unconstitutional on the basis that it violated the &quot;one-subject rule&quot; contained in Ohio Const. art.

The court granted the township's summary judgment motion and denied the developers' summary judgment motion. The developers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real estate developers alleged that the denial of their rezoning request to permit the development of real property into a planned unit development was arbitrary and unreasonable because the denial had no substantial relation to public health or safety, as required by R.C. 519.02. The township sought a declaration that Am. Sub. S.B. 18, Gen. Assem. (Ohio), which amended R.C. 519.02, was unconstitutional. The issues to be determined were whether Am. Sub. S.B. 18 was unconstitutional under the single subject rule of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D) and, even if such legislation was unconstitutional, whether the developers had a vested right for the law under the unconstitutional version which was to be applied. On appeal, the court found that Am. Sub. S.B. 18 violated the single subject rule in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D) and, therefore, was unconstitutional. In addition, the developers did not have a vested right to pursue their claim under Am. Sub. S.B. 18. Accordingly, there was no taking of their property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tobacco company sought review of a judgment from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment to appellees, the Ohio Attorney General (OAG) and the Ohio Tax Commissioner, on four counts of the company's amended complaint, wherein it sought declaratory and injunctive relief arising from the failure to list the company's cigarettes on the OAG website as those that could be stamped or sold.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a master settlement agreement between tobacco companies and governmental entities, the company paid fees as a non-participating manufacturer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1346.02(B)(3). The OAG determined that the company was not a tobacco product manufacturer. The company filed suit, and a magistrate heard the matter. The trial court granted the company's request for a preliminary injunction, finding that it was not afforded a hearing. In granting summary judgment to the OAG on certain claims, the trial court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1346.01(I)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague and there was no conflict with federal trademark law. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in concluding that the vagueness challenge failed, as there was no ambiguity in the language of the statute. There was no abuse of discretion in denying the company's request under Ohio R. Civ. P. 56(f) for a continuance in order to conduct additional discovery. The finding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1346.01(I)(1) did not violate the Supremacy Clause was proper, as there was no conflict with 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1121(b) and 1127 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1051-1127.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the bank's motion for summary judgment, finding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.01 was unconstitutional as applied to the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A robber approached the bank teller's window and demanded money. This was the second robbery that occurred while the teller worked at the bank, although she held a different position previously. She suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a consequence of the second robbery. Her workers' compensation claim was rejected as non-compensable under &sect; 4123.01(C), and all administrative appeals were denied. The teller then filed the action pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.512, alleging that she had a right to participate in the workers' compensation fund and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.01(C)(1) was unconstitutional. The trial court found the statute unconstitutional and denied summary judgment to the bank. On appeal, the court found that there was no rational basis to discriminate between psychological injuries arising from a physical injury to an employee or to a co-worker, and those which were purely psychological in nature. Accordingly, &sect; 4123.01(C)(1) violated the Equal Protection Clause and went against the purposes of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35. Whether the statute violated art. II, &sect; 35 was therefore a moot issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment for domestic violence arguing that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.25 had been rendered unconstitutional in light of the adoption of Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11, the Defense of Marriage Amendment. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied the motion. Defendant pled no contest to the charge and was found guilty. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it found him guilty of domestic violence, pursuant to 2919.25, because the statute was unconstitutional as applied to unmarried couples after the inception of Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11. He claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.25 created a relationship intended to approximate the design, qualities, significance, or effect of marriage. The appellate court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.25 was neither unconstitutional on its face, nor unconstitutional as applied to defendant. It was clear that the domestic violence statute afforded protection from assaults committed during relationships that could not possibly be found to be in conflict with Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11, including married couples, and a child-parent or child-stepparent relationship. It could not have been said beyond a reasonable doubt that there were no facts or circumstances under which the statute would have been considered constitutional. Further, five other appellate districts had already determined that the Ohio domestic violence statute did not conflict with Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen filed an action against defendant board of education seeking an injunction and civil forfeiture, as provided for in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 121.22(I)(1). The Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted the citizen's motion for summary judgment, entered an injunction against the board, and ordered the board to pay a civil forfeiture, court costs, and reasonable attorney's fees. The board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen alleged that the board had violated Ohio's Sunshine Law, specifically Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 121.22(F), by conducting meetings absent a rule establishing a method by which the public could determine the time, place, and purpose of special meetings. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the citizen. The provision of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 121.22(I)(1), providing for the issuance of an injunction where a violation of the statute had been proven, was not an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine. Because the injunction at issue was statutory, it would have been inappropriate for the trial court to engage in a balancing of equities even absent the statutory language. Furthermore, the court retained its fact-finding authority in determining whether a violation of the statute had occurred. Additionally, the citizen had standing pursuant to the statute itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator was confined for violating the conditions of his post-release control. He filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that the post-release control statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.28, was unconstitutional. The court determined that &sect; 2967.28 was unconstitutional because a term of incarceration could not have been imposed by a branch of government, other than the judiciary, without violating the doctrine of separation of powers. As the statute delegated judicial authority to the parole board to impose, at its own discretion, a new term of imprisonment on an offender for violating post-release control sanctions, it did violate the separation of powers doctrine. Therefore, the statute was unconstitutional and the writ of habeas corpus was granted. Moreover, &sect; 2967.28 contained no provision for any type of an appeal, judicial or administrative, from the parole board's imposition of a new prison term. In order to achieve standing to appeal, a defendant would have had to forego a timely appeal of his sentence and conviction and hope to be allowed to proceed through an Ohio App. Dist. 4 R. 5(A) delayed appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his sole assignment of error, defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12 was unconstitutional pursuant to the Ohio Constitution. The appellate court found that the notion that there was a personal right to carry concealed weapons that was a fundamental right under the United States and Ohio Constitutions had been repeatedly and emphatically rejected. Furthermore, there was neither case law of the Ohio Supreme Court or the Ninth District upholding a constitutional challenge to &sect; 2923.12. Under Ohio law, &sect; 2923.12 was a reasonable regulation which regulated only the manner in which weapons could be carried and did not act as a total prohibition on the carrying of weapons. Consequently, the court could not find that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Ohio, sought review of a judgment from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which declared Am. Sub. S.B. 18, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2004) unconstitutional, null, and void in its entirety. The matter was raised by appellees, a metropolitan housing authority and numerous township boards of trustees, in a declaratory judgment action that challenged the constitutionality of Am. Sub. S.B. 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original purpose of the bill was to revise R.C. 3735.27 in order to change the composition of certain metropolitan housing authorities. After moving through the legislative process, the bill also included amendments to various statutory sections relating to zoning regulations, and enactment of R.C. 3313.537, which involved community school students' participation in extracurricular activities. The inclusive form of the bill became a law. Appellees challenged Am. Sub. S.B. 18 in their declaratory judgment action pursuant to Civ. R. 57 and R.C. 2721.02. The trial court found no violation of the uniformity clause under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. However, it held that it violated the one-subject-rule and three-consideration provision of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D) and (C). The trial court, upon finding no ability to sever the bill, declared it unconstitutional in its entirety. On appeal, the court initially found that appellees had standing to challenge the bill. It found that Am Sub. S.B. 18 contained at least three unrelated topics, such that there was a violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D). As there was no &quot;primary&quot; subject matter of the bill, severance could not be had.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County, Ohio, which imposed maximum consecutive felony sentences for felonious assault under R.C. 2903.11 and abduction under R.C. 2905.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two offenses arising out of an argument with his girlfriend. He was sentenced to the maximum sentences of eight and five years, and the trial court ordered that the sentences be served consecutively. The sentence was later overturned in light of State v. Foster. He received the same sentence upon resentencing, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that, given the clear and comprehensive holdings of the State v. Hodge case, it was evident that R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) was not revived and there was no requirement for the trial court to make specific findings prior to imposing consecutive sentences. This was despite the fact that amendments to Ohio's felony sentencing statutes that occurred after Oregon v. Ice was released contained the formerly excised fact-finding provisions. Further, the retroactive application of State v. Foster to cases pending on direct appeal did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. This was confirmed by the Ohio Supreme Court in State v. Elmore.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio appealed a decision from the Richland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which held that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007), was unconstitutional both facially and as applied to appellee inmate. The inmate was convicted of sexual battery. The matter arose in the inmate's challenge to his sexual offender reclassification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of sexual battery. Thereafter, he was notified that pursuant to the Adam Walsh Act (AWA) and R.C. 2950.01 et seq., as amended by S.B. 10, his sexual offender status was reclassified. The inmate filed a petition to contest the reclassification, wherein he challenged the classification and the application of the AWA to him. The trial court relied on another case holding in determining that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional because it violated the prohibitions against retroactive and ex post facto laws. Accordingly, judgment was entered in favor of the inmate. On appeal, the court noted that the case relied on by the trial court was reversed on appeal, such that the constitutionality of S.B. 10 was upheld. The court accordingly relied on the appellate decision in the precedential case to find that the trial court decision was in error. Rather, S.B. 10 survived constitutional challenge on a number of issues. The court held that the prior classification system did not create an expectation that an inmate would never be the subject of further legislative action.</SPAN></P>

In 2012, defendant filed another motion for judicial release, which the trial court granted. The State argued that under the current version of R.C. 2929.20, defendant was not eligible for judicial release. The court stated that the trial court's determination of eligibility was prior to the effective date of H.B. 86. Accordingly, the trial court honored the spirit of R.C. 2901.04(A), the rule of lenity, when it stated that fundamental fairness did not permit it to withdraw its previous determination of defendant's eligibility and that basic fairness required that the version of R.C. 2929.20 that applied was the one in existence at the time of the sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Relator filed a complaint for writ of habeas corpus, contending that the post-release control statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.28, was unconstitutional. The court determined that &sect; 2967.28 was unconstitutional because a term of incarceration could only have been imposed by the judiciary. As &sect; 2967.28 delegated authority to the parole board to impose, at its own discretion, a new term of imprisonment on an offender for violating post-release control sanctions, it violated the separation of powers doctrine. Therefore, the statute was unconstitutional and the writ of habeas corpus was granted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A lawsuit was instituted against various state officials, challenging the constitutionality of the Ohio system of funding public education. Following various proceedings, appeals, and rulings, a motion was filed in the original trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The highest appellate court, in the school funding case, issued four separate opinions. The public school financing system was found to violate Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 2. The Ohio General Assembly was directed to create an entirely new school-financing system. The plaintiffs in the original school funding case had recently filed a motion in the original trial court, seeking to schedule and conduct a conference to address the various state officials' compliance with the previous court orders. In addressing the State's request for a writ of prohibition in the instant matter, the highest appellate court found that the requested conference was nothing more than an ill-disguised attempt to require judicial approval for proposed remedies before the remedies were enacted. Advisory rulings were being requested on the constitutionality of legislation that had not yet passed. Normally the trial court did not retain jurisdiction over the constitutionality of new legislation enacted in response to a judicial declaration that a legislative act was unconstitutional. It was beyond doubt that the trial court patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction over any additional proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Summit County, No. 18930.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case concerns the legal effect of two actions taken by a decedent prior to the effective date of Ohio's Transfer-on-Death Security Registration Act. First, in 1983, Chester S. Bielat opened an Individual Retirement Account (&quot;IRA&quot;) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. In the &quot;Adoption Agreement&quot; that he signed to open this account, Chester named his sister, Stella, as the beneficiary of the account's balance upon his death. Shortly thereafter, Chester made a will containing a clause giving all of his property to his wife, Dorothy, upon his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, three years before Chester's death, the General Assembly codified Ohio's version of the Uniform Transfer-on-Death Security Registration Act (&quot;Act&quot;), R.C. 1709.01 et seq., 145 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2858. The Act provides, inter alia, that &quot;any transfer-on-death resulting from a registration in beneficiary form * * * is not testamentary.&quot; (Emphasis added.) R.C. 1709.09(A). Accordingly, the Act removes such transfers on death from the decedent's testamentary estate, and also from the purview of Ohio's Statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Wills, which outlines the formalities that apply to testamentary dispositions.  R.C. 2107.03.  R.C. 1709.11(D) makes the entire Act applicable to registrations in beneficiary form made &quot;prior to, on, or after the effective date of this section, by decedents dying prior to, on, or after that date.&quot; R.C. 1709.11(D).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after Chester's death in 1996, Dorothy discovered that Chester had named Stella the beneficiary of his IRA. Dorothy filed a complaint in the Summit County Probate Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that she, not Stella, was entitled to the IRA proceeds. Dorothy's argument to the probate court consisted of four steps. First, Dorothy argued that Chester's IRA beneficiary clause constituted testamentary language when it designated Stella as the pay-on-death beneficiary of the account. Second, Dorothy argued that the beneficiary clause was, therefore, null and void, since the Adoption Agreement in which the clause appeared did not comply with the signature and attestation requirements of our Statute of Wills. Third, even though R.C. 1709.09(A), supra, defines beneficiary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  registrations such as this one as &quot;not testamentary,&quot; Dorothy argued that the Act could not constitutionally apply retroactively to Chester's IRA beneficiary clause, which was signed a decade prior to the effective date of the Act. Finally, Dorothy averred that without the Act to validate the beneficiary clause in the IRA, the IRA account balance would be transferred not to Stella, but rather to Chester's probate estate, where it would pass to Dorothy under the terms of Chester's will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After considering Dorothy's declaratory judgment action and Stella's motion to dismiss, the probate court concluded that the Act validated the non-testamentary transfer-on-death clause in Chester's IRA even though the beneficiary designation in the IRA was created before the effective date of the Act. Therefore, the probate court ordered the balance of the IRA to pass to Stella under the terms of the beneficiary clause that Mr. Bielat had signed in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorothy appealed this judgment to the Ninth District Court of Appeals. She argued that the application of the Act to the pay-on-death beneficiary registration that Chester executed prior to the Act's effective date constituted a retroactive application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the law in violation of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. The court of appeals affirmed the probate court's decision in favor of Stella. The court held that although the Act was being applied in this case to a transfer-on-death beneficiary clause executed before the Act's effective date, the Act did not impair a vested right belonging to Dorothy, and thus did not violate the Ohio Constitution's prohibition against retroactive laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Deceased opened an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), and named his sister, appellee, as the beneficiary of the account.

The Supreme Court affirmed, and held that the Uniform Transfer-on-Death Security Registration Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1709.09(A), 1709.11(D), constituted remedial, curative statutes that provided a framework by which parties to certain investment accounts could more readily enforce their intent to designate a pay-on-death beneficiary. Relevant sections of the Act were remedial because they did not impair vested rights, impose new duties, or create new obligations; thus, they could not be construed as substantive provisions for purposes of the constitutional prohibition against retroactive laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations (Ohio), terminated the parties marriage by decree of divorce. Some issues were reversed on appeal. Upon remand, the trial court adopted a magistrate's decision finding that it was in the children's best interest to modify the shared parenting agreement as to child care expenses and also found that former R.C. &sect; 3113.215 was constitutional. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court erred when, on remand, it modified the shared parenting agreement to require appellee mother to pay her own child care expenses when the children were in her possession. The appellate court held that there was no plain error in the trial court's adoption of the magistrate's decision. The father did not file objections to the decision. Further, the trial court did not err in finding that former R.C. &sect; 3113.215(B)(6)(a) withstood the father's constitutional challenges. The father's unsupported assertions of unconstitutionality were insufficient to satisfy his burden, particularly in light of the well-recognized presumption of constitutionality. The father's initial premise was incorrect in that he claimed that former R.C. &sect; 3113.215 contained a presumption that in shared parenting cases, only one parent was presumed to pay child support. The statute contained no express language to support that premise, nor had any court found the existence of such a presumption. Because all of the father's arguments flowed from that faulty premise, they tumbled like a house of cards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Although the judgeship provision and the mayor's-court provision shared a common relationship of regulating the organization and structure of Ohio's statutory courts, there was a blatant disunity between the texting-while-driving provision and the other portions of H.B. 606; [2]-Because the mayor's-court provision was consistent with the original primary purpose of the legislation, the purpose could be preserved by severing the texting-while-driving provision. Thus, the portions of H.B. 606 amending R.C. 4511.204 and R.C. 4511.205 were unconstitutional and had to be severed; [3]-H.B. 606 was a valid exercise of the Ohio General Assembly's authority under Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 1 to establish and regulate statutory courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Jackson County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted summary judgment to appellee insurer, and against appellant executrix, in her wrongful death suit. The court also rejected the executrix's constitutional challenge to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.44. The executrix appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executrix challenged the judgment entered, first contending that the insurance policy at issue did not clearly and unambiguously restrict all of her claims to the &quot;each person&quot; limit. The appeals court held that since she failed to raise this issue below, it was not properly preserved. Second, she alleged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.44 was an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers, due process, and the right to remedy grounds. However, her equal protection argument was unpreserved. As to the remaining claims, the legislature was free to further legitimate public policy objectives. Such legislation did not usurp judicial power, but exemplified the government's system of checks and balances. Moreover, &sect; 3937.44 did not infringe upon the executrix's right to bring suit, nor did it place any limit upon the damages recoverable. The statute merely permitted the insurer to limit its assumed liability. The insured tortfeasor remained personally responsible for any damages in excess of his policy limits. Finally, even if recovery was a fundamental right, the executrix failed to demonstrate that the statute limited the exercise of that right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio appealed a decision from the Richland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which held that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007), was unconstitutional both facially and as applied to appellee inmate. The inmate was convicted of rape and gross sexual imposition. The matter arose in the inmate's challenge to his sexual offender reclassification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of rape and gross sexual imposition. Thereafter, he was notified that pursuant to the Adam Walsh Act (AWA) and R.C. 2950.01 et seq., as amended by S.B. 10, his sexual offender status was reclassified. The inmate filed a petition to contest the reclassification, wherein he challenged the classification and the application of the AWA to him. The trial court relied on another case holding in determining that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional because it violated the prohibitions against retroactive and ex post facto laws. Accordingly, judgment was entered in favor of the inmate. On appeal, the court noted that the case relied upon by the trial court had been reversed on appeal. Accordingly, S.B. 10 had been declared constitutional therein. The court relied on the appellate decision in the precedential case to find that the trial court decision was in error. Rather, S.B. 10 survived constitutional challenge on a number of issues. The court noted that the prior classification system did not create the expectation that the inmate would never be the subject of further legislative action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant union sought review of a decision from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which dismissed the union's mandamus complaint, seeking to compel appellees, the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation and its administrator, to follow the law expressed in two prior opinions relating to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4123.93 and 4123.931. The Bureau filed a cross-appeal from the court of appeals' adoption of most of a magistrate's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union filed the complaint against appellees, alleging that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.931 as amended by Am. Sub. S.B. 227, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2002) contained provisions that were substantially identical to former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.931.  The union contended that the amended versions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;4123.93 and 4123.931 were unconstitutional. The magistrate who heard the matter found that the union had standing, but it failed to show that appellees had refused to comply with prior judicial precedents. The court of appeals overruled the union's objections, declared objections by appellees moot, and dismissed the complaint. The court of appeals did not adopt the finding as to standing, as it held the issue moot. On appeal by both parties, the court initially denied their request for oral argument under Ohio Sup. Ct. Prac. R. IX(2)(A). The court found that appellees did not disregard prior case precedents, as those cases dealt with former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.931. As the challenged legislation did not operate directly and broadly to divest courts of judicial power, and the union had an adequate remedy at law through a declaratory action, dismissal was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a &quot;Motion for Relief from Application of the Adam Walsh Act&quot; in the Miami County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) after he was notified that he was reclassified as a tier III sex offender under Am. Sub. S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) (S.B. 10). The trial court denied the motion, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said S.B. 10 violated the non-delegation doctrine. The appellate court disagreed because the legislature decided his tier, and related duties, and the Attorney General was better able to decide the details of how to disseminate his personal information. He did not show S.B. 10 denied substantive or procedural due process because he showed no deprivation of a liberty or property interest, as he had no vested right, or liberty interest, in his original classification and registration duty. He was not entitled to a hearing before his reclassification because it depended entirely on his crime. He had no standing to assert a substantive due process challenge to S.B. 10's residency requirements because he showed no actual injury. S.B. 10 was not overbroad or vague because it gave more guidance, and less discretion, than its predecessor, which was found neither vague nor overbroad. His claims that his reclassification violated double jeopardy, was cruel and unusual punishment, and violated sentencing purposes failed because S.B. 10 was not punitive. It did not violate his right to a jury trial by enhancing his sentence because it was merely a consequence of his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the action between petitioner employee and respondent school district, the United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, Western Division, presented two certified questions of state law: whether R.C. 3319.391 and former Ohio Admin. Code 3301-20-01 violated the Retroactivity Clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, and whether R.C. 3319.391 and former Ohio Admin. Code 3301-20-01 violated the Contract Clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1976, the employee was convicted of drug trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03. The employee entered into a two-year administrative-employment contract with the school district in July 2008, beginning on August 1. The employment contract was made subject to confirmation of appropriate state certification, which required the employee to submit to a background check. The background-check requirement previously applied only to licensed positions, but legislation enacted in 2007 extended it to include administrative employees within the school district. The employee was notified that his 32-year-old drug-trafficking conviction was discovered during the background check, and the employee was terminated because of the prior conviction. The court held that the contract between the school district and the employee failed to become binding. The revisions to the background-check statutes and corresponding administrative regulations did not substantially impair the contractual relationship, but merely prevented the employee from being able to meet the condition precedent of the contract. Also, the background-check legislation in R.C. 3319.391 was prospective in application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As applied to administrative employment contracts of school districts governed by R.C. Chapter 124, R.C. 3319.391 did not violate the Retroactivity Clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, and R.C. 3319.391 and former Ohio Admin. Code 3301-20-01 did not violate the Contract Clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. Whether former Ohio Admin. Code 3301-20-01 was unconstitutionally retroactive was not addressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a traffic stop, defendant was charged with failing to wear a safety belt. Defendant's motion to dismiss was overruled, he was convicted, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that it was able to consider the constitutional argument without a transcript. A statute was presumed constitutional, and this presumption could not have been overcome unless there was a clear conflict between the statute and some particular constitutional provision. R.C. 4513.263 was not unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1. Operating a vehicle was a privilege, not a fundamental right. The seat belt law did not merely implicate the personal freedom and rights of the person choosing not to wear the belt, but also impacted the personal safety and welfare of others who were placed in harm's way. Other assignments of error raised by defendant relating to the hearing on his motion to dismiss were not addressed due to his failure to provide a transcript.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the Warren Municipal Court (Ohio) on one count of violating Howland Township Resolution 95-148 which prohibited barking and noisy animals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to appellant's neighbor, appellant owned three dogs that barked constantly. The neighbor made an audio recording of the barking she could hear from her bedroom window. Appellant contended the trial court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss after determining the ordinance was constitutional. Appellant argued the resolution was impermissibly vague. The court agreed, concluding that an individual of ordinary intelligence could not understand his responsibilities under the law. Almost all dogs barked or emitted audible sounds at one time or another. The court did not know what constituted an &quot;unreasonably loud&quot; sound. Everyone had different sensitivities. Reasonableness was a subjective term that offered virtually no guidance to the dogowner trying to comply with the legislation. The legislative body had used a subjective term, &quot;disturb,&quot; as the key word in the ordinance. A resident of Howland Township could not know whether his dog's barks were of such an intensity and duration so as to disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reversed and judgment entered for appellant. The trial court erred in overruling appellant's motion to dismiss. The ordinance which prohibited barking or noisy dogs, was unconstitutional since a person of average intelligence would not understand what he was required to do under the law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by imposing consecutive sentences without making findings under R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and 2929.41(A). Defendant asserted that State v. Foster's holding that those statutes were unconstitutional was no longer valid in light of Oregon v. Ice. He asserted that the statutes were, therefore, revived because they were never specifically repealed by the Ohio General Assembly. The state supreme court found that the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Oregon v. Ice did not revive Ohio's former consecutive-sentencing statutory provisions, R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and 2929.41(A), which were held unconstitutional in State v. Foster. Because the statutory provisions were not revived, trial court judge was not obligated to engage in judicial fact-finding prior to imposing consecutive sentences, unless the General Assembly enacted new legislation requiring that findings were to be made. Therefore, the trial court did not err in imposing consecutive sentences without applying R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and 2929.41(A). Accordingly, defendant was not entitled to resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a large cinema company, sued defendants, four cities and their respective municipal officials, claiming the admissions taxes imposed on movie patrons by defendants were unconstitutional. The trial court found that there were no constitutional violations. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding first that the restrictions were content-neutral, as nothing in the ordinances referred to the content of films shown, and the taxes applied to numerous other entertainment activities. Therefore, the ordinances warranted intermediate scrutiny. Under that standard, the ordinances were sufficiently narrowly tailored to address defendants' legitimate concerns, as they raised valuable revenue for traffic, crowd control and security at venues which attracted a large number of people in a congested area at the same time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court affirmed; defendants' ordinances were content-neutral, and were narrowly tailored to meet defendants' concerns about additional traffic and safety caused by the large number of patrons attending plaintiff's facilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A non-attorney limited partner with appellant taxpayer, a limited partnership owning real property, filed with the Cuyahoga County Board of Revision for a decrease in the assessment of appellant's real property. The school district counter-complained, requesting that the property value as determined be retained. The board of revision's grant of a decrease in taxable value was challenged by appellant before the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals on the theory that the reduction should have been greater. The board of tax appeals found that the filer of appellant's original complaint was neither its general partner nor an attorney, and thus the board of revision's jurisdiction had not been invoked, and the complaint was dismissed. The court affirmed. The filing of a complaint before the board of revision constituted the practice of law.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.19(A)(1)(e) (amended), which permitted persons not attorneys or the property owners, to file complaints before the board of revision on behalf of the owner, was unconstitutional as being an exercise of Ohio Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the ordinance was vague and overbroad, and that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The appeals court found that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that having dogs which barked intermittently for hours at a time, and which had caused dozens of complaints over the years, would be prohibited. The ordinance provided reasonably clear guidelines as to what it required of individuals within the municipality. Accordingly, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. The weight of the evidence indicated that defendant's dogs frequently and habitually barked. There was no strong reason in the record to disbelieve a neighbor's testimony, and the rebutting testimony of defendant and other witnesses was specifically found by the judge to be vague and less than credible. Likewise, the trial court's conclusion that the barking was unreasonably loud and disturbing was supported by the evidence. The neighbor testified that the barking so affected his family that he lost sleep, his performance at work was impaired, and his wife required antidepressants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the advertiser's application was based, in part, on Franklin Township, Ohio, Zoning Res. 501.3.C, which absolutely banned billboards. The appellate court held this ordinance was void because R.C. 519.20 specifically allowed the placement of outdoor advertising in all districts zoned for industry, business or trade or on lands used for agricultural purposes. R.C. 519.20 was a general statute, so any local ordinance of a township which conflicted with it by forbidding that which the statute expressly permitted could not stand.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's death sentence was vacated, and the State sought a new penalty phase proceeding, the Ashland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sustained defendant's motion to bar the State from seeking the death penalty, finding current R.C. 2929.06 was unconstitutional as applied to defendant and ordering that he be resentenced under the version of &sect; 2929.06 in effect when he committed his crimes. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found current R.C. 2929.06 created a right to impanel a new jury for death penalty resentencing which did not exist under the version of &sect; 2929.06 in effect when defendant committed his crimes, placing a burden on him which did not exist under prior law. The appellate court held he could not be resentenced under former &sect; 2929.06 because his sentence was not vacated for a reason stated in the statute, so he had no right not to face the death penalty again. If he did, his right to resentencing did not vest until his sentence was vacated, so current R.C. 2929.06 was not substantive as it did not deprive him of a vested right when it was enacted, nor did it create a new right or impose a new burden, as he always had (1) a right to have the death penalty decided by a jury and (2) an obligation to defend against it. The fact that current R.C. 2929.06 mandated the impaneling of a new jury did not render this procedural statute substantive. The statute only altered the methods for finding if a defendant's conduct was punishable by death. It did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 because it was procedural.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagor argued that S.B. 185, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the mortgagor did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of S.B. 185 because she asserted in her appellate brief that her father's rights were violated, not her own. Her father was not a party in the proceedings, nor was he a party to the appeal. The mortgagor did not argue that her constitutional rights were violated by the legislation. Further, she waived the argument because she failed to bring the claimed constitutional violation to the attention of the trial court at any time after the enactment of S.B. 185. Next, there was nothing in the record to support her statements or argument. Finally, there was a strong presumption that S.B. 185 was constitutional. Even if the mortgagor's constitutional argument was not barred, she failed to cite which of the numerous sections of S.B. 185 she alleged was unconstitutional.

Since the trial court relied on some of these unconstitutional and excised statutes in imposing defendant's consecutive sentence, his sentence had to be vacated, and he had to be resentenced in accordance with Foster.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Licking County, Ohio, upholding the constitutionality of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) as applied to defendant, and finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in adjudicating defendant delinquent for rape for engaging in sexual conduct with an 11-year-old child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose from incidents in which two boys under 13 years of age engaged in sexual activity. Defendant did not assert that R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) was unconstitutional on its face, but rather asserted that it was unconstitutional as applied to him. The reviewing court held that R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) was unconstitutional as applied to a child under the age of 13 who engaged in sexual conduct with another child under 13. The prosecutor's choice to charge defendant but not the complainant was the very definition of discriminatory enforcement. As applied to offenders who were under the age of 13 themselves, the statute was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution because arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement was encouraged. Also, application of the statute in the instant case violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution because only one child was charged with being delinquent, while others similarly situated were not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator labor organization filed six petitions for amendment of certification and clarification of a bargaining unit. The State of Ohio moved to dismiss the petitions on the basis of an amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3318.31(B). Respondent, the State Employment Relations Board, dismissed the petitions. The labor organization sought a writ of mandamus. A magistrate recommended dismissal of the case. The labor organization filed objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The labor organization's petitions sought, among other things, to include certain employees in collective bargaining units. In dismissing the petitions, the Board found that the employees were exempted from the definition of public employees, pursuant to an amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3318.31(B). The magistrate then concluded that the labor organization's action, although styled as a mandamus action, actually sought a declaratory judgment, as the court would have to determine that the amendment was unconstitutional in order to provide relief. Because the instant court did not have jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions, the magistrate recommended that the court dismiss the organization's case. The court rejected this recommendation, and found that the mandamus action was properly before the court, even though it also sought a declaration as to the constitutionality of the amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3318.31(B). The court then found that the amendment was unconstitutional. It was in violation of the one-subject rule of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D). It was, in essence, a rider attached to an appropriations bill, and did not share a common purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The labor organization's objections were sustained in part and rendered moot in part. The writ of mandamus was granted in part and denied in part. The magistrate's findings of fact were adopted by the court as its own. The magistrate's conclusions of law were rejected, and a writ of mandamus was issued, ordering the board to reinstate the organization's six petitions upon its docket within 30 days, and to render a decision on them.</SPAN></P>

The Medina County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sentenced him to three years in prison and designated him Tier II Sexual Offender under the provisions of the Adam Walsh Act (AWA), R.C. Chapter 2950. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the AWA was unconstitutional because it violated the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution and operated as an ex post facto law in violation of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The appellate court held that the AWA did not violate the Retroactivity Clause, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, because the Ohio General Assembly clearly expressed its intention that its provisions with respect to adult sex offenders would apply retroactively. The additional registration content of the AWA did not violate the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution with respect to adult offenders. Further, the AWA did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because the registration and verification provisions of the AWA were not excessive with respect to its nonpunitive purpose. The legislature clearly expressed its intention that the AWA was civil and nonpunitive in nature. Considering the Kennedy factors, the appellate court found that the AWA was not so punitive in effect as to negate the clearly expressed purpose of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a worker and his wife, sued respondents, an employer and two manufacturers, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division, for employer intentional tort, products liability, and loss of consortium. Respondent State of Ohio intervened. The court certified questions to the Ohio Supreme Court as to the constitutionality of R.C. 4123.93, R.C. 4123.931, R.C. 2305.10(C) and former R.C. 2305.10(F).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was hurt at work by the manufacturers' machine. The supreme court held subrogation statutes under which the employer sought an interest in any recovery against the manufacturers were not uncompensated takings because they greatly reduced a chance of reimbursing the employer for payments the worker never received. They also did not violate due process as the worker and employer shared any undercompensation. They did not offend equal protection since they applied to claimants settling with a third party and claimants going to trial. Statutes of repose applicable to the worker's products liability claim did not offend his right to pursue a remedy because they kept a claim to which such right could apply from vesting. Due course of law and equal protection provisions were not violated as legislative findings showed the statutes' relation to the public welfare. There was no unconstitutional taking of a claim which was not allowed to vest. Former R.C. 2305.10(F) (now R.C. 2305.10(G)) was unconstitutionally retroactive as applied to the worker because his claim, vesting before the statute's enactment, was impaired when he unreasonably had only 34 days after his injury to sue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow said provisions of R.C. 2307.91, R.C. 2307.92 and R.C. 2307.93 were unconstitutionally retroactively applied to her case. The supreme court held the provisions did not affect her vested, substantive, rights. She had no vested right in an incorrect holding that pleural thickening was an injury, as it was not the common law. The statutory definition of &quot;competent medical authority,&quot; concerning competency to testify, was procedural. Requiring asbestos exposure to be a &quot;substantial contributing factor&quot; to a claimant's medical condition did not alter substantive causation elements. A vague statutory requirement that asbestos exposure be the &quot;predominate cause&quot; of an impairment, construed not to offend the retroactive legislation ban, required a finding that a physical impairment would not have occurred without asbestos exposure, and did not alter the common law. R.C. 2307.91(FF) did not alter the common law causation standard, as it was not inconsistent with a decision that did not address its requirements. The statutory definition of &quot;substantial occupational exposure&quot; did not alter the common law when a statute that did alter the common law was simultaneously enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties engaged in a romantic relationship which resulted in the birth of a child.

The father moved to extinguish the arrearage pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.13 and in response, the mother sought a declaration that &sect; 3111.13(F)(3) was unconstitutionally retroactive pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The trial court held that the statute was constitutional, but on appeal, the court of appeals deemed it unconstitutional as applied. On further review, the court agreed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.13(F)(3) was unconstitutional as applied to the father. The court held that the General Assembly clearly intended that &sect; 3111.13(F)(3) was to be applied retroactively. As &sect; 3111.13(F)(3)(a) was substantive, it was constitutionally violative as applied to the father because the mother had a vested right in the arrearage order, which was issued prior to the amendment of &sect; 3111.13(F)(3)(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a trucking association, an insurance association, and an insurance institute (collectively, the truckers) challenged an amendment to R.C. 4509.05, which increased the fee charged by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles for obtaining certified abstracts of driving records. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) held that the statute violated Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 5a. Defendant state officials appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truckers had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the amendment because their members would otherwise have had standing to sue in their own right; the interests the truckers sought to protect were germane to the associations' purposes; and, neither the claims asserted nor the relief requested required the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. The state officials argument that nothing in art. XII, &sect; 5a prohibited the ability of the General Assembly to raise revenue or apportion funds and, therefore, any constitutional violation arose from the expenditure of funds drawn from the treasury was obviated by the parties' stipulation that the State spent the money in ways inconsistent with the Ohio Constitution. Because the state officials conceded that the funds listed in R.C. 4509.05(C) that received a portion of the proceeds from the five dollar fee imposed under the statute were not expended for highway purposes, the truckers presented evidence of a presently existing set of facts that made the statute unconstitutional and void when applied to those facts. Finally, the severability test for &sect; 4509.05(C) was not met.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Hamilton, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 537.17 on the grounds that it was overbroad, vague, and impermissibly content-based, in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The appeals court disagreed. First, while the ordinance on its face swept too broadly, it was capable of being narrowly construed to proscribe only the fighting words class of unprotected speech. Second, defendant's vagueness argument was rejected, as it was unsupported by cite case law or statutes, as required by Ohio R. App. P. 16(A)(7). Third, while the ordinance was presumptively invalid because it criminalized fighting words only against police officers, it nonetheless was not an unconstitutional content-based restriction. The ordinance did not suppress all statements or remarks made to a police or peace officer, only those which amounted to verbal abuse and stated derogatory remarks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss was overruled. Defendant, who was 14 and 15 years old when he committed the crimes eight years earlier, pled no contest to two counts of sexual battery. The Portage County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) found him guilty and sentenced him to five years in prison and adjudicated a Tier III sexual offender. Defendant's motion to file a delayed appeal was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because R.C. 2151.23(I) allowed the State to prosecute him as an adult for offenses he committed while he was a juvenile, the statute violated his fundamental right to be tried in juvenile court as well as his rights to due process and equal protection. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss because he failed to demonstrate that R.C. 2151.23(I) (1997) impaired any fundamental right. Changing the jurisdiction from juvenile court to the general division did not violate his due process rights. Moreover, no equal protection violation was shown because the record demonstrated a rational basis for the classification contained in R.C. 2151.23(I). The legislature chose to authorize prosecution of those in defendant's position in the general division because persons who commit offenses as juveniles but who were not prosecuted until after they turned 21 were not likely to be amenable to the juvenile justice system. Finally, his claim that the new statutes increased the punishment for his conduct was speculative and he had virtually no chance of being kept in the juvenile system.</SPAN></P>

Cross-appellants, a freehold and a nonfreehold elector, also appealed the determination of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circulators asked the board to erect a new township pursuant to &sect;&nbsp;503.09. However, a question regarding the constitutionality of &sect;&nbsp;503.09 prompted the declaratory judgment action. The electors and the circulators also raised the constitutionality issue. The electors cross-claimed, seeking a declaration that the circulators' petition was invalid. In resolving summary judgment motions, the trial court found that &sect; 503.09 was constitutional. It also held that the petition was insufficient because a map setting forth the territory for the new township was not attached. On appeal, the court noted that &sect; 503.09 established two classifications within the general class of electors living in the township. Finding that the statutory procedures were a substitute for the fundamental right to vote, the disparate treatment of nonfreehold electors who lived in the unincorporated township section violated the equal protection and the self-governance clauses of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. However, there was a compelling justification for excluding the vote of those electors who resided in incorporated areas of the township. The court found severance under Geiger and R.C. &sect;&nbsp;1.50 appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter with instructions for the trial court to vacate its decision declaring &sect; 503.09 constitutional and its judgment finding that the circulators failed to comply with the statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on one count of sexual battery, in violation of &sect; 2907.03, for alleged sexual conduct with a 17-year-old female student while he was employed as a security guard at the student's high school. The appellate court held the trial court's reliance on the overbreadth doctrine was misplaced. The application of the overbreadth doctrine was limited to the First Amendment context. Defendant identified no First Amendment issues at stake in the case. Accordingly, there was no basis for the trial court's finding that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad. Neither was the statute unconstitutionally vague. The plain meaning of the words &quot;other person in authority,&quot; as used in the statute, could be clearly understood by the average person to include a school security guard. The statute was capable of being applied consistently and fairly. Contrary to defendant's assertion, a school security guard did necessarily interact with students. Finally, the issue of whether the State produced sufficient evidence to satisfy an offense under &sect; 2907.03(A)(7) was a matter to be determined at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Ohio State Employment Relations Board (SERB) sought review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) which determined that an amendment to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Ohio Civil Service Employees Association (OCSEA) was the exclusive bargaining representative for certain collective-bargaining units. When its attempt to reach an agreement proved unsuccessful, OCSEA filed six petitions with SERB. While the petitions were pending, the Ohio General Assembly enacted Am. Sub. H.B. 405, Gen. Assem. (Ohio year) which amended, enacted, or repealed over 90 sections of the Ohio Revised Code and enacted 44 uncodified provisions of law. It also amended Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3318.31, resulting in the exemption of the employees at issue from Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4117.0. The Supreme Court held that the issue of OCSEA advancing nonconstitutional theories was immaterial to whether it had an adequate remedy at law by way of a declaratory judgment action. A declaration that Am. Sub. H.B. 405, Gen. Assem. (Ohio year) was unconstitutional would not have provided OCSEA with a complete remedy unless coupled with a mandatory injunction ordering the reinstatement of the six petitions. Accordingly, OCSEA did not have a plain and adequate remedy by way of declaratory judgment. Finally, the amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3318.31 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was thereafter convicted as charged after a jury trial and he was sentenced to imprisonment. The trial court adjudicated defendant as a sexually oriented offender. On appeal, the court found that denial of the dismissal motion was proper. The statutes at issue did not prohibit constitutionally protected speech and were not overbroad, as they did not prohibit virtual child pornography. The court distinguished the holding in Ashcroft with respect to the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, as that legislation was overbroad in its prohibition of images that recorded no crime and created no victims by its production. As the Ohio criminal statutes at issue only prohibited materials produced by the use of real children, the constitutional challenge failed. Accordingly, defendant's counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise that argument at the trial court level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Fulton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of importuning, in violation of R.C. 2907.07(D)(2), sentenced him to community control sanctions, and classified him as a Tier I sex offender under amended R.C. 2950.01 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from his solicitation of a law enforcement officer who had posed as a 14-year-old girl to engage in sexual conduct. Defendant entered into a plea agreement, whereby he entered guilty pleas to four counts of importuning in exchange for dismissal of other charges by the State. The trial court found defendant guilty and ordered a presentence investigation. The trial court, inter alia, classified defendant as a Tier I sex offender based upon the amended version of &sect; 2950.01 et seq. pursuant to Am. Sub. S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007). On appeal, the court held that defendant's claims that application of the amended version of &sect; 2950.01 et seq. to him was unconstitutional lacked merit. The legislation was civil and non-punitive in nature, such that it was not violative of retroactive or ex post facto principles. As there was no indication that defendant lived within the restricted zone pursuant to R.C. 2950.034, his claim that the restrictions therein violated his substantive due process rights was premature and without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12 was constitutional. Defendant had not shown Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12 violated the Second Amendment. Because defendant contended Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12 denied a fundamental &quot;individual&quot; right to bear arms, a right the Second Amendment did not protect, and did not contend the statute infringed upon the preservation of a militia, the Second Amendment was not violated, even if defendant's assertion were true. The &quot;reasonableness test&quot; on bearing arms under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 4 had not been overruled and was controlling in determining whether Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12 was unconstitutional in limiting a person's right to carry a concealed weapon. Under the law in Ohio, a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons was constitutional as a valid exercise of the state's police power. Ohio Rev.

Although the allegations of the town's complaint were partially couched in terms of compelling affirmative duties, i.e., to order the county and its officers to apportion and distribute the funds in accordance with the 1990 alternate formula, the essence of their claims involved declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction. Therefore, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to consider the claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate filed a petition to contest his reclassification as a Tier III sex offender, pursuant to R.C. 2950.031(E). His request for counsel was denied. Following a hearing, the Ross County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) overruled the constitutional challenges to S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) and found that none of the factors excepting defendant from the community notification requirements of R.C. 2950.11 applied. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that S.B. 10's retroactive application was an unconstitutional ex post facto law in violation of the United States Constitution and a violation of the Ohio Constitution's prohibition against retroactive laws. The appellate court held that the inmate did not show beyond a reasonable doubt that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional. First, because R.C. Chapter 2950 remained civil in nature, it was not unconstitutionally retroactive, pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. Further, the inmate had no right to appointed counsel in his R.C. 2950.031(E) proceeding because it was a civil matter and because he had no liberty interest in his previous classification. Thus, he had no settled expectation regarding his registration obligations and had not been deprived of any liberty interest. Additionally, S.B. 10 did not abrogate a final judicial determination in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. Finally, the inmate failed to show that he had standing to assert his argument that the residency restrictions in R.C. 2950.034(A) presently harmed him or that the argument was ripe for review since he was in prison and did not own a home.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator union filed a mandamus action, seeking to order respondents, the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (OBWC) and its administrator, to follow the law that was set forth in two judicial precedents recent to the instant action. The matter was referred to a magistrate, and respondents sought dismissal of the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union sought to compel respondents to comply with the Ohio Supreme Court decisions in Holeton and Glaspell, following the amendments to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4123.93 and 4123.931 (2003). Respondents moved to dismiss, alleging that the union lacked standing and that there was an adequate remedy at law. The magistrate found that the union had organizational standing but that the mandamus action should either be dismissed or denied. Both parties filed objections. The court found that the union had an adequate remedy at law through a declaratory judgment action, wherein a determination as to the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.931 could be made. The court held that an action in mandamus was not stated, as the complaint sought declaratory relief and an injunction. The magistrate thoroughly reviewed the history of former &sect; 4123.931 to its present form, and she found no showing that the courts had not complied with the holding in Holeton. Further, the magistrate's determination that Glaspell did not impose a duty upon respondents that was enforceable in mandamus was proper, as the union was not raising the issue of construction of a contract of adhesion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the union's objections to the magistrate's determination, adopted the findings and conclusions of the magistrate, and granted respondents' motion to dismiss the mandamus action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's child lived with her mother at the home of the grandparents. After the mother died, the father was granted custody of the child. While the trial court initially granted the grandparents' motion for grandparent visitation, it later denied the motion on the ground that there was not overwhelmingly clear circumstances that supported forcing visitation over the opposition of the father. The appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court found that, while Ohio courts were obligated to afford special weight to the wishes of parents of minor children when considering petitions for non-parental visitation made pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3109.11 or 3109.12, those statutes did not unconstitutionally infringe on a parent's fundamental right under U.S. Const. amend. XIV to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of his or her child. The statutes limited the parties who could petition for visitation, limited the application of the statutes to cases where there is a specified predicate event or condition, and expressly identified the parents' wishes and concerns regarding visitation as a factor the court must consider in making its determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Van Wert Municipal Court (Ohio) finding him guilty of one count of failing to securely confine his dogs in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 955.22(D)(1), and a lesser count of allowing his dogs to run at large in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 955.22(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an argument at defendant's residence between a tenant and a former tenant, a third individual entered defendant's residence and accidentally released defendant's two dogs--a Pit bull mixed breed and a Labrador mixed breed. Before the tenant could retrieve the stray dogs, they entered a neighboring yard and frightened the neighbors. After a short trial, defendant was found guilty of failing to securely confine his dogs under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 955.22(D)(1), and of allowing his dogs to run at large under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 955.22(C). He was fined $ 225 and was placed on probation for two years. Defendant appealed his conviction, contending that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 955.22 was facially unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1. Defendant further contended that &sect; 955.22 was unconstitutional as applied, because someone other than himself let his dogs out of his home. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, holding that defendant's arguments failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality afforded the statute, and that &sect; 955.22 was enacted within the duly authorized police powers granted to Ohio.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Defendant's arguments, that the statute under which he was convicted--which regulated the ownership of violent or dangerous dogs--was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him, failed to rebut the strong presumption of constitutionality afforded the statute. Also, the right to regulate violent or dangerous dogs was within Ohio's broad police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees workers sued appellants manufacturers in the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for negligence, negligent installation, strict liability, breach of warranty, fraudulent concealment, and conspiracy, related to their alleged asbestos exposure. The trial court granted their motion to apply the law as it existed prior to the enactment of Am. Sub. H.B. 292, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2004) (H.B. 292), and the manufacturers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held retroactively applying H.B. 292 violated the bar against retroactive laws in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The appellate court held this was a final and appealable order, under R.C. 2505.02(A)(3) because it was a provisional remedy and, in effect, determined the action and prevented a judgment in favor of the appealing party. H.B. 292's prima facie filing requirements did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 and applied to cases pending on its effective date because it (1) was expressly retroactive and (2) did not impair substantive rights, as it did not relate to rights creating a cause of action or make it more difficult to succeed on the merits, but, rather, was procedural in nature. It did not change substantive common-law elements of causation by requiring prima facie evidence that asbestos exposure substantially contributed to a worker's injury. A particular worker's medical evidence did not meet the requirements of R.C. 2307.92(B) because it (1) did not show if his doctor was a competent medical authority, (2) had no detailed occupational or exposure history, and (3) did not list his principal places of employment or exposures to airborne contaminants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings. The trial court was ordered to administratively dismiss, without prejudice, a particular worker's claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant health department issued a compliance order to appellee couple requiring the mandatory inspection of their rental properties for up to four years. The couple's appeal to the Housing Appeals Board was denied. The Common Pleas Court reversed the board. On appeal, the Ninth District Court of Appeals held that application of an ordinance to the couple violated their rights under the Ohio Constitution. This discretionary appeal was allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The couple failed to show that Akron, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 150.40(A)(2), as applied to them, violated Ohio Const., art 1, &sect; 16. This conclusion flowed from one undisputed fact: the circumstances of the conviction that led to the mandatory inspections were not part of the record. The couple was urging the court to hold that the mandatory inspections at issue violated the Due Process Clause of the Ohio Constitution although the court did not know the nature of the code violation. Such an approach would have required the court to hypothesize about possible violations and to then determine that the resulting inspections violate the Due Process Clause. The reasonableness and arbitrariness of a mandatory inspection under Akron, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 150.40(A)(2) were inextricably related to the violation that gave rise to that inspection. Absent evidence of the underlying violation, the court lacked the necessary information to determine whether the ordinance was constitutional under Ohio Const., art 1, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed a judgment from the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division (Ohio), which classified him as a juvenile sex offender, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2152.83 and 2950.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's mother found defendant engaged in sexual conduct with his three-year-old half-brother. Defendant was taken into custody and charged with being a juvenile delinquent by reason of rape, which would have been in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(1)(b) if committed by an adult. After an adjudicatory hearing, defendant was found to be a delinquent. When defendant was subject to supervised release, he was found to be a juvenile offender registrant under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2152.811 et seq. On appeal, the court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 had withstood constitutional challenges on many issues. The court found that as applied to juvenile offenders, ch. 2950 was constitutional with respect to the right to privacy because it was rationally related to the General Assembly's legitimate interest of protecting the public from sexual offenders, regardless of age. Ch. 2950 was not punitive in nature. Another constitutional issue was not reviewed, as it was not raised in the trial court. Defendant's counsel raised the constitutionality argument with respect to ch. 2950 and accordingly, there was no finding that he rendered ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant home owner sought review of a judgment from the Greene County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted the motion of appellee, a deceased contractor's executor, to dismiss the owner's action pursuant to R.C. 2305.131 upon finding that the claim was filed beyond the 10-year limitation period. The owner had alleged that the contractor applied siding incorrectly to a home addition, which resulted in rot in the walls.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The home owner and the contractor entered into a contract for the construction of an addition onto the owner's home. Fifteen years after the project was completed, the addition had to be destroyed due to rotten walls from water damage. The owner filed suit against the deceased contractor's estate, alleging that the siding had been applied incorrectly and caused the water damage. In response to the executor's motion to dismiss the claim, the trial court found that &sect; 2305.131 was constitutional, that the complaint was filed beyond the 10-year period, and that dismissal was proper. On appeal, the court reviewed case precedents that had struck down a prior version of &sect; 2305.131 as being violative of the right-to-a-remedy provision of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court held that the two versions of R.C. 2305.131 were not &quot;substantially the same,&quot; such that the judicial precedent was not directly controlling and did not warrant stare decisis application. The court held that there was no violation of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 by the present version of R.C. &sect; 2305.131. The owner's cause of action against the contractor never accrued, and it accordingly never became a vested right.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner alleged that a city's zoning ordinance regarding planned zoning districts constituted a taking of her property. On appeal, the court found that the ordinance was not unconstitutional on its face because it was rationally related to encourage economic stability and growth while protecting the stability and preservation of residential neighborhoods. The owner's inability to get a zoning designation change did not make the zoning ordinance unconstitutional as applied to the owner's property because the owner still had the ability to use the subject property as zoned. There was not an unconstitutional taking of the owner's property, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, for which the owner was entitled to compensation because the property was usable to the owner as a zoned property, just not to the owner's best economic advantage. There was no violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio Constitution because the city's ordinance was facially constitutional as the city had a legitimate interest in creating the planned district where the owner's property was located and the owner failed to show any alleged discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted a series of ordinances - Toledo, Ohio, Ordinance 291-02, 271-03, and 765-03 - to regulate predatory mortgage lending practices. The lender filed suit, which was amended after each new ordinance was enacted. The lender claimed that the ordinances violated the Ohio Home Rule Law. The State intervened and claimed that the city was challenging the constitutionality of the Ohio predatory lending statute, Am. Sub. H.B. 386, Gen. Assem. (Ohio). The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees, on the grounds that H.B. 386 preempted the city ordinances. On appeal, the court held that the state predatory law constituted a general law, and that portions of the municipal scheme conflicted with the state law. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.63 was unconstitutional as a violation of home rule to the extent that it limited local regulation. Several conflicting provisions in the city's ordinances were severable, while others were not conflicting with the state law. Similarly, the court made findings that several municipal provisions were void for vagueness, but they were severable, while other provisions withstood the vagueness challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings. The court certified a conflict with a judgment from the Ohio Court of Appeals, Second Appellate District, with respect to the question of whether the municipal predatory lending law was in conflict with the Ohio predatory lending law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant subdivision residents and appellee property developer sought review of a decision from the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which involved the enforceability of certain deed restrictions. The matter arose in the residents' action, seeking a declaration regarding an interpretation of the validity and enforceability of certain restrictions, and injunctive relief against the developer's potential violation thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer acquired four parcels of land in the subdivision, and the residents commenced their action. The trial court found that a notice of claim was invalid because it was not duly verified by oath, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5301.51, such that three of the four parcels had no use restrictions under the Ohio Marketable Title Act (MTA), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5301.47 to 5301.56. One plot was found to have the restrictions, and an injunction was imposed. On appeal by both parties, the court initially found that the decision was final and appealable, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2505.02. The residents' claims with respect to the restricted lots were rendered moot by their failure to obtain a stay of execution of the trial court's order, and by the subsequent construction on the property. As the notice of claim did not comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;5301.51(A), it was properly held to be void. The multiple challenges to the constitutionality of the MTA were properly found meritless. Use restrictions should have been found invalid as to the last parcel of land, based on the root of title and the failure to comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5301.49(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the residents' appeal with respect to the restricted deeds to be moot, and it affirmed the declaration that the notice of claim was void and that the MTA was constitutional as applied. The court reversed the trial court's declaration that use restrictions applied to one parcel, and instead declared that the particular parcel was free of those restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee registrant was indicted in separate cases in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for failure to verify his address, as required by R.C. 2950.06, and for three counts of failure to notify, in violation of R.C. 2950.05(D) and 2950.05(F)(1). The trial court dismissed the indictments. The State of Ohio appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The registrant was reclassified, pursuant to Ohio's Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, R.C. Chapter 2950, as amended by S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio), as a Tier III sex offender. As a Tier III sex offender, he was required to register with the local sheriff's office every 90 days for life and was subject to community notification. The trial court found that the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that the Act was constitutional because it did not offend the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution, as the Act was civil and nonpunitive and the Ex Post Facto Clause applied only to criminal statutes. Further, the Act did not violate the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution. Furthermore, because the Act was civil and nonpunitive, it likewise did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Additionally, because the registrant did not allege, much less establish, that he was deprived of his property rights, he lacked standing to challenge the residency restrictions under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of the trial court were reversed, and the cases were remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sexual predator classification, by Franklin County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), arguing that the determination was against weight of evidence and that promulgation of factors at Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(B)(2) violated separation of powers principles. He raised other previously decided constitutional issues solely to preserve them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his classification as a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 as unsupported by clear and convincing evidence; he also argued that the statute violated federal and Ohio constitutional provisions regarding separation of powers, equal protection, ex post facto laws, and double jeopardy. The last three claims were summarily dismissed, as the statute had already survived these challenges. The court held that despite the trial court's mistaken application of one factor for consideration listed at Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2), the record contained sufficient clear and convincing evidence regarding existence of several factors supporting classification. On the constitutional claim, the court noted that this was an area of overlapping authority; the legislature listed factors in response to the perceived need for legislation, but left discretion in application to the courts by providing a catchall factor and by indicating that the factors were nonexclusive guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, because there was ample clear and convincing evidence supporting defendant's classification and the statutory factors were not an impermissible encroachment, because they were not exclusive, and were rather guidelines that a court was to consider on the way to exercising its own powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A domestic registry was created under Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinance ch. 109. The representative instituted a taxpayer action seeking to enjoin the implementation of the registry. The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss and denied injunctive relief. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the registry ordinance was not unconstitutional under Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11. The registry was simply a label that conferred little or no legal benefits on the domestic partners and did not approximate the design, qualities, significance, or effect of marriage. Further, the registry was not unconstitutional under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The Cleveland domestic partner registry ordinance was nearly identical to the registry that was previously upheld in Cleveland Hts. ex. rel. Hicks v. Cleveland Hts. It conveyed no rights, was open to residents and nonresidents, there was no cost to the city, and no public or private entity was obligated to recognize it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor child was conceived after the mother and the presumptive father were divorced. Genetic testing determined that the father was indeed the child's father, however, after the mother and child submitted to testing, the father was killed. Consequently, the final determination came by taking a sample from the decedent. The paternal grandparents then filed suit seeking visitation rights. On the second appeal, the mother argued that the trial court erred and abused its discretion in failing to properly review the factors set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.051(D), as well as failing to afford the mother's decision special weight. The mother also argued that granting visitation rights violated the mother's due process rights. The appellate court found that the mother did not argue that it was unconstitutional for her to be brought into court on a visitation order at all. She argued that the actual order was an unconstitutional infringement of her fundamental right to raise her daughter as she saw fit. The grandparents presented no compelling governmental interest for interfering with the mother's fundamental right to raise her daughter as she saw fit.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3793.07, defendant director of the department of alcohol and drug addiction services, who defended the statute's constitutionality, appealed a decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that resolved cross-motions for summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff chemical dependency counselor applied to the Ohio Credentialing Board (OCB) for a chemical dependency counselor's certification, but plaintiff counselor, who was a member of plaintiff National Association of Forensic Counselors, failed to achieve a sufficient grade to earn the OCB's certification. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3793.07 violated the Ohio Constitution because it was an improper delegation of legislative authority to a private entity, the OCB. The trial court granted summary judgment in plaintiffs' favor. Defendant, the director of the department of alcohol and drug addiction services, argued that the trial court erred in concluding that &sect; 3793.07 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court reversed the trial court's decision, concluding that the statute established an adequate procedure for review to ensure that the credentialing process continued to meet the legislative policy of serving the public interest. Defendant was empowered with on-going discretion to review OCB's credentialing process. Thus, the statute met the requirements for a constitutional delegation to the OCB.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that defendant had not demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the portion of the statute specifically involved, as written, was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 2925.01(BB) clearly stated that an offense was committed in the vicinity of a juvenile if defendant committed the crime within 100 feet of a juvenile or if the offense was committed within the view of a juvenile. The statute required either that the offense be committed within 100 feet of a juvenile or within the view of a juvenile. Based on the testimony of the police captain and officer, defendant committed the charged offenses within 100 feet of a juvenile. Hence, that portion of the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Furthermore, each time the officers went to defendant's home for a controlled drug buy, there were children present. Thus, defendant's conduct was in violation of Ohio Rev.

The City also alleged that the uncodified law accompanying &sect; 1.63 abused judicial authority in violation of Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The trial court found that the City's ordinance conflicted with the State law, that the City's ordinance was not purely a matter of self-government, and that the State law was a general law. On appeal, the court found that the matter was not purely a local self-government issue, and that a general law was involved.

The trial court granted appellees' motion to declare that changes in R.C. Chapter 2307 effective after suit was filed did not apply retroactively, and the manufacturers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held retroactively applying R.C. Chapter 2307, as amended by Am. Sub. H.B. 292, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2004) (H.B. 292), violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 because it denied the workers a vested right by retroactively changing the meaning of the term &quot;injury.&quot; The appellate court held the trial court's order was final and appealable, under R.C. 2505.02(A)(3) because the Ohio Supreme Court held, in a factually indistinguishable case, that a ruling on the constitutionality of retroactively applying R.C. 2307.92 was a provisional remedy that, in effect, determined the action and prevented a judgment in favor of the appealing party. H.B. 292 did not violate the bar against retroactive laws in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 because the Ohio Supreme Court held R.C. 2307.91 et seq. (1) was expressly made retroactive and (2) did not impair substantive rights, as it was procedural rather than substantive, so it was applicable to the workers' suit. It was error to hold that, before H.B. 292's enactment, &quot;injury&quot; had a fixed legal meaning within the context of asbestos litigation because, before H.B. 292, there was no such statewide standard.</SPAN></P>

The Brown County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) entered judgment, denying the complaint and the request for injunctive relief. The renter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resolution written for the parking ordinance at issue stated the county hospital was located on the street, visibility of traffic could be impaired by vehicles parked within the right-of-way of the street, and the current parking system presented a risk of accident and injury to residents and users of the street. The renter argued that the ordinance was not rationally related to the purpose of safety because there was no evidence that his parked vehicles presented any safety risk to hospital travelers, residents, or others using the street. After finding that municipalities could regulate the use and control of their streets and that legislative enactments enjoyed a presumption of constitutionality, the appellate court found the ordinance was constitutional. Public safety was a proper police power. It was the renter's decision to have a passenger vehicle, a pickup truck, and a large utility trailer at his residence, and the fact there was no substantial off-street parking and/or driveway available to him was not the village's fault. The ordinance did not infringe on property rights, was not overbroad, and was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of public safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that R.C. 2907.07(D)(1) was unconstitutional on its face because it violated the Due Process, Equal Protection, and Free Speech Clauses of the United States Constitution. The appellate court held that R.C. 2907.07(D)(1) was constitutional on its face. R.C. 2907.07(D)(1) was narrowly tailored to serve the compelling state interest of protecting minors from being solicited to engage in illegal sex acts by adults using a telecommunications device. Accordingly, R.C. 2907.07(D)(1) did not violate the principles of Ashcroft or the First, Fifth, or Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. R.C. 2907.07(D)(1) properly prohibited adults from taking advantage of minors using the anonymity and ease of the Internet and instant messaging communication. Further, R.C. 2907.07(D)(1) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the application of the statute did not treat people differently on an arbitrary basis, nor did it require the application of a strict scrutiny test.</SPAN></P>

Assem. (Ohio 2007), was unconstitutional in its entirety. The matter arose in appellee inmate's declaratory judgment action that challenged S.B. 10 after he was reclassified as a Tier III offender under R.C. 2950.01(G)(1)(h).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted and sentenced for attempted rape, and he was found to be a sexually oriented offender. Thereafter, he was reclassified under S.B. 10 and he challenged the constitutionality thereof on multiple grounds. The trial court determined that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional both facially and as applied to the inmate because it violated prohibitions against retroactive laws and ex post facto laws by imposition of new and additional burdens on the inmate. The trial court also found that it was punitive in nature. Other constitutional challenges were rejected by the trial court. On appeal, the court initially noted that the court had jurisdiction to review the matter, and that the OAG was the proper party to appeal on behalf of the State pursuant to R.C. 2721.12(A). The court held that S.B. 10 was not in violation of the retroactivity or contracts clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The legislation was remedial and non-punitive in nature, the dissemination of truthful information aided public safety, and the inmate had no reasonable expectation of finality with respect to his convictions.

Summary judgment for the board was affirmed because (1) even though a plurality of the Ohio Supreme Court had expressed a view that &sect; 2744 was unconstitutional, a majority of the Ohio Supreme Court had not concluded that &sect; 2744 et seq. was unconstitutional, (2) the administrator failed to show that the board's actions were done with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner, so that the defense of immunity was not available to the board under Ohio Rev.

The Board of Tax Appeals concluded that the employee was unauthorized to sign the complaint on behalf of the corporation, and it dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court held that R.C. 5715.19(A), which permitted the filing of a complaint with a board of revision by various individuals including a salaried employee, was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt to the extent that it permitted a salaried employee to prepare and file a complaint on behalf of a corporation, in that it permitted the unauthorized practice of law, in violation of Ohio Sup. Ct. R. Gov't Bar VII(2)(A). Since the employee who signed the complaint was a non-attorney salaried employee and the corporation had not provided any evidence that he was a corporate officer, the employee was unauthorized to prepare and file the complaint on behalf of the corporation with the board of revision. Thus, the Board of Tax Appeals did not err in dismissing the corporation's complaint on that basis.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.14(B), (C), (E)(4), 2929.19(B)(2), and 2929.41(A) was error, as they had been declared unconstitutional under Apprendi and Blakely principles. The court noted that upon resentencing after Foster, findings and reasons were not required prior to imposition of maximum, consecutive, or more than the minimum sentences. Defendant's claim that Foster violated his right against ex post facto legislation was not ripe for review because defendant had not yet been sentenced under Foster.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to attempted gross sexual imposition and was classified as a sexually oriented offender. Seven years later, pursuant to R.C. &sect; 2950.031, the State sought to enjoin defendant from continuing to reside in his home, which was located within 1000 feet of an elementary school. The Miami County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) entered judgment against defendant and ordered him to vacate his home of 30 years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that R.C. &sect; 2950.031 constituted an unconstitutional retroactive application of law. The appellate court held that R.C. &sect; 2950.031 was unconstitutional because it applied to require defendant, an owner and occupier of real estate who owned and occupied the real estate before the enactment of the statute, and whose predicate offense occurred before the enactment of the statute, to vacate the residence. Defendant had owned and occupied his residence for 30 years, both before he was convicted of a sexual offense and before the enactment of R.C. &sect; 2950.031. The provisions of the statute would have required him to leave his home, at least, if not also to divest himself of ownership of his home. Therefore, it affected a substantive right--specifically, his right to maintain the residence that he owned and in which he resided for years prior to the enactment of R.C. &sect; 2950.031. Accordingly, the residency restriction of R.C. &sect; 2950.031, as applied to the facts of the case, constituted a retroactive law affecting a substantive right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the injunction requiring defendant to vacate his residence was vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender said reclassifying him when he committed his offense before S.B. 10 was adopted violated prohibitions on ex post facto laws, retroactive laws, the separation of powers doctrine, double jeopardy, and his due process rights.

Moreover, the offender had no standing to claim S.B. 10's restriction in R.C. 2950.034 on where sex offenders could legally reside violated his substantive due process rights, as he did not claim he was currently violating that restriction or that he was forced to move due to his close proximity to a school. His claim that he could not be subject to S.B. 10's community notification requirement was moot because, as a tier II sex offender, he was not subject to this requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Warren County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) of three counts of allowing an underage person to remain on her premises while possessing or consuming alcoholic beverages, in violation of R.C. 4301.69(B). Her sentence included three years of community control, with conditions. She appealed her convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said a community control condition barring her alcohol consumption or possession was an abuse of discretion. The appellate court held there was no abuse because it was less likely juveniles would consume alcohol in her home. Convicting her of three crimes did not offend double jeopardy because letting &quot;any underage person&quot; stay in her home while drinking or possessing alcohol was a violation, so she could be convicted for each of three minors. It was no error, at sentencing, to consider that she sent victims who were drinking home without calling their parents, as their vulnerability was relevant. R.C. 4301.69(B) was not overbroad because no substantial deterrent effect on protected conduct was shown. It was not unconstitutionally vague because it stated a clear conduct standard, gave fair notice of barred conduct, and did not encourage arbitrary arrests. It was no error to admit alcohol containers not used to commit the crime because pictures of defendant with three minors holding such containers were admitted, and they said they or others drank the contents of substantially similar containers. Defendant's admission proved alcohol was consumed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, in granting the motion for summary judgment, and the appellate court, in affirming the judgment, found that &sect; 4123.93 was unconstitutional. The supreme court found that, under the rational-relationship test, &sect; 4123.93 was unconstitutional because it precluded claimants who were parties to actions against third-party tortfeasors from showing that their tort recovery or portions thereof did not duplicate their workers' compensation recovery and, therefore, did not represent a double recovery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator former administrative law judge commenced an original action in mandamus seeking a declaration that Am. Sub. H.B. 1 (Ohio) was unconstitutional and an order that respondent State Employment Relations Board recognize her as a classified employee and reinstate her to her former position. The Board filed a motion to dismiss. A magistrate recommended granting the motion to dismiss. The judge filed objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge asserted that the magistrate erroneously concluded that the objective of her action was a declaratory judgment and that she could obtain adequate relief in the court of common pleas. The appellate court held that the judge's mandamus action failed because she had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. A declaration that H.B. 1 was unconstitutional, and an injunction prohibiting its continued application, absent a mandatory injunction, would not have provided the judge complete relief because it would not require the reinstatement of her employment. Thus, the availability of a declaratory judgment action did not provide a basis for precluding relator's mandamus action. However, on administrative appeal from the State Personnel Board of Review (SPBR), the common pleas court could have determined the constitutionality of H.B. 1 and, should the court have determined that H.B. 1 was unconstitutional, determined that the judge remained a classified employee at the time of her removal. The common pleas court would not have been precluded from considering and determining the constitutionality of H.B. 1 in its review of SPBR's dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed judgments from the Bowling Green Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted each of them individually for hosting a nuisance party, in violation of Bowling Green, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 132.18. The trial court had determined that the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each defendant was cited for violating &sect; 132.18, and they all filed dismissal motions to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance. The trial court reviewed one defendant's case, noting that upon arrival by police to that defendant's residence, the officers heard loud noise and music, saw people with beer in the front yard, and observed litter on the lawn. Defendant, who appeared to have had alcohol, identified himself as being 19 years old and being responsible for the party. The trial court rejected the constitutional challenge and found all defendants guilty as charged. On appeal, the court found that the vagueness challenge lacked merit, as undefined terms were reasonably ascertainable, the ordinance gave fair warning to the ordinary person, and there was no impermissible delegation of power. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally broad under U.S. Const. amend. 1, as the freedom of association involved was not a fundamental freedom that was entitled to strict scrutiny, and an equal protection challenge also failed under the rational basis test. There was mens rea to support the conviction, and no contest pleas were presumed properly accepted under Ohio R. App. P. 9.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3111.13(F)(3)(a), to set aside an order requiring him to pay child support arrearages. Appellant mother filed a motion for declaratory relief, asking the court to declare that &sect; 3111.13 was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ten years after she gave birth, a mother filed a paternity action against the child's father. The trial court found that the father was the child's biological father, and it ordered him to pay child support and $ 44,960 in child support arrearages. Two and a half years later, the father filed a motion, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.13(F)(3)(a), to set aside the award of child support arrearages. In response, the mother sought a judgment declaring that &sect; 3111.13 was unconstitutional, but a magistrate refused to declare that the statute was unconstitutional and the trial court overruled the mother's objections to the magistrate's decision. The appellate court held that &sect; 3111.13(F)(3), which allowed the father to seek a modification of existing orders for back child support because the mother did not file her paternity action before the child attained the age of three years and the father did not know or have reason to know that he had a child, affected the child's substantive right to receive child support, and to the extent it applied to cases where the court's order was entered before October 27, 2000, the date it became effective, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate pled guilty to sexual battery, gross sexual imposition, corruption of a minor, and disseminating matter harmful to juveniles and was classified a sexual predator. Later, he was notified that he was being reclassified as a Tier III sex offender. He filed a petition to contest the application of S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) to him. The Ross County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied the petition. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that the trial court erred when it found that the amended sections of R.C. Chapter 2950, known as the Adam Walsh Act, were constitutional as applied to him. The appellate court held that the inmate failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional. Since R.C. Chapter 2950, as amended, remained civil in nature, it did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 by applying a retroactive punishment. Also, because the inmate had no reasonable expectation that his sex offenses would never be subject to future sex offender legislation, it could not be said that S.B. 10 abrogated a final judicial determination in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. Further, because R.C. Chapter 2950 remained civil in nature, and not punitive, following the enactment of S.B. 10, it did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Finally, the inmate failed to show standing to challenge the constitutionality of the residency restriction contained in R.C. 2950.034. He was incarcerated and there was no evidence that he owned a home located within 1,000 feet of a school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant charged, in the Auglaize County Municipal Court (Ohio) with driving under the influence of alcohol, contrary to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19, moved to suppress field sobriety test results. The trial court held Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(D)(4)(b), allowing admission of field sobriety tests conducted in &quot;substantial&quot; as opposed to &quot;strict&quot; compliance with testing standards was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19, found at &sect; 4511.19(D)(4)(b), allowed field sobriety tests conducted in substantial compliance with standards of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to be admitted in evidence against defendant. Before the amendment, strict compliance with these standards was required, pursuant to an Ohio Supreme Court decision. The trial court found the amendment violated Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5 by conflicting with a previous rule of practice and procedure. The appellate court held it had to find the amendment constitutional unless it was shown to be unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Under art. IV, &sect; 5, only statutes conflicting with a formally proposed and adopted rule of evidence were invalid. No provision of the Ohio Rules of Evidence had been adopted regarding the standard of admissibility for field sobriety tests. Therefore, the amendment did not infringe on the Ohio judicial branch's exclusive authority to promulgate rules of procedure for its courts. A statute could govern the admissibility of evidence, and this amendment simply replaced the common law standard of admissibility.</SPAN></P>
