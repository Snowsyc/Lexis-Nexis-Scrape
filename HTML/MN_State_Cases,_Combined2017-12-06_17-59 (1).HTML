<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer filed petitions objecting to respondent county's valuation of its property used for a department store, for property taxes assessed on January 2, 2003, January 2, 2004, and January 2, 2005. The county moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county alleged that, although the taxpayer provided some summary profit and loss statements to the county relative to the January 2, 2003 petition, the information provided by the taxpayer did not contain real estate related expenses required to be paid by the department store under the lease. In addition, the county requested that the January 2, 2004 and January 2, 2005 petitions be dismissed because the taxpayer failed to submit any available income and expense information to the county. The plain language of the 60 Day Rule, Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.05, subd. 6(a). (2003), and prior case law required the production of the information, including the type of information that the taxpayer failed to submit. Further, the arguments concerning reliance (i.e. the taxpayer did not &quot;know&quot; what was to be provided), had no merit. The taxpayer failed to produce the real estate expense/lease information as required by the 60 Day Rule for the January 2, 2003 assessment. In addition, the taxpayer failed to provide any information for the January 2, 2004, and January 2, 2005, assessments. Thus, the taxpayer had not complied with the 60 Day Rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Crystal, Minnesota, cited relator for violating a city code provision that prohibited the storage on one's property of abandoned, inoperable, unlicensed motor vehicles and other items of litter, and for violating a city zoning ordinance prohibiting the outdoor storage of those things within an R-1 zone, which was the zoning classification for relator's land. The evidence showed that relator bought the property in 1993 to use as an accessory to his wife's assembly and packaging business and for the storage of vintage motor vehicles which he collected, restored, and sold. The use of the property for outdoor storage did not become unlawful until it had existed for many years. Minn. Stat. &sect; 462.357, subd. 1e (2004) and Crystal, Minn., City Code &sect; 515.01, subd. 8(b) (2004) provided that a nonconforming use of property that lawfully preexisted a code change could continue. The hearing officer erred by concluding that the 2004 code revisions made relator's use of his property impermissible.</SPAN></P>

The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, found defendant guilty as charged and imposed sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant argued that using his prior administrative/civil license revocations to enhance his current DWI charges to felonies violated his due-process rights and his right to counsel. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that because defendant received all the process that he was due in his license revocations, the outcomes of those proceedings could be used to enhance his subsequent DWI charge to a felony. Using a revocation as an aggravating factor to support an enhanced DWI charge did not violate defendant's due-process rights. Absent citation to any authority for extending the right to appointed counsel to a civil license-revocation proceeding when the outcome of the revocation proceeding might affect the outcome of a separate, future criminal proceeding, defendant failed to show that his DWI convictions were obtained in violation of his right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of insurance fraud, he filed a motion alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Trial counsel of record was allowed to withdraw. The case was continued twice to allow defendant time to retain new counsel. At sentencing, defendant sought appointment of a public defender. The district court did not rule on the motion, but imposed a sentence and ordered defendant to pay restitution. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court held that defendant did not show that trial counsel's representation was ineffective. He had no evidence to support a claim of a conflict of interest. Further, any decision regarding which witnesses to interview and to call at trial was a tactical decision left to the attorney's discretion. Next, defendant was not denied the right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;6. Defendant's rights were vindicated by the ample time he received to secure private counsel. Moreover, defendant's right to appointed counsel under Minn. Stat. &sect; 611.17, subd. 1(a)(2) (2004) and Minn. R. Crim. P. 5.02, subd. 3(2) were not violated since he wanted private counsel until the date of sentencing.</SPAN></P>

But even though petitioner knew, or should have known, the bases for his constitutional claims at the time of his conviction, he did not raise these claims in his direct appeal. The statutory basis for petitioner's conviction did not change from the time he was charged for aiding and abetting first-degree controlled substance crime, and any challenge to the statutory basis of petitioner's conviction was fully available on direct appeal. The postconviction court correctly concluded that petitioner's constitutional claims were barred by the Knaffla rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer received compensation for services she rendered at a bakery. She failed to file Minnesota income tax returns for 1996 to 1998, and the Commissioner assessed taxes. She appealed an order issued by the Commissioner. The taxpayer sought to amend her appeal to add a new claim, which was a constitutional challenge. The tax court granted the motion. In affirming the Commissioner, the tax court determined that it had jurisdiction. There was no concurrent jurisdiction between the district court and the tax court, despite issues related to several Erie transfers. The tax court had jurisdiction to hear the claims and factual issues asserted prior to the amendment of the appeal. There was no reason for a stay either because the taxpayer did not intend to offer any additional evidence on her new constitutional claim. Next, the tax court rejected the assertion that Minn. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;289A.37, subd. 3 was unconstitutional. The taxpayer cited no authority that placing the burden of proof on her was unconstitutional, and the income tax system in Minnesota had been found constitutional in the past.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred by suppressing the drugs because the officer's search behind the vehicle speaker was authorized under various exceptions to the warrant requirement. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant was stopped for failing to signal a turn, for a taillight violation, and because a records check indicated that the vehicle's registered owner had an outstanding warrant for his arrest. While searching defendant's vehicle pursuant to the arrest, the officer noticed that the speaker on the driver-side door was &quot;ajar.&quot; Based on the officer's training and experience he believed that contraband was hidden behind the speaker. However, other than the officer's training and experience, there was no independent basis for probable cause to search behind the speaker. In addition, the search behind a loose speaker was not permitted in the police department's inventory policy. It was not reasonable to believe that the officer would expect to find the same type of personal belongings behind a loose speaker that would be found in a glove compartment, trunk, box, or suitcase. Therefore, the trial court properly suppressed the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Further, the inmate did not cite any legal authority to support his claims, and he did not allege any facts that would defeat the Knaffla procedural bar. Even if the claim were not waived, the district court correctly noted that its failure to file a sentencing departure report in a timely manner did not invalidate the inmate's sentence. Since both of the inmate's convictions were sentenced with a criminal history score of zero, the order in which they were announced was irrelevant. The inmate did not allege any facts that suggested that the waiver of his right to be sentenced under the guidelines was invalid.</SPAN></P>

The sentence was a double-upward departure from the sentencing guidelines' presumptive sentence. The matter was remanded for resentencing. The district court imposed the earlier 60-month sentence, and as required by the appellate court's remand order, found the petitioner eligible for supervised release. The petitioner argued that the district court erred in denying his motion for sentence modification. The appellate court ruled that the district court properly applied the law and did not abuse its discretion. The scope of the remand order was limited to reviewing the denial of eligibility for supervised release. The portion of the original district court order imposing the 60-month sentence was affirmed by the appellate court and not subject to resentencing. That portion of the decision was final and therefore, not subject to the benefit of the U.S. Supreme Court Blakely decision. The district court's order upon remand, which modified the petitioner's sentence and determined that he was eligible for supervised release, occurred after the Blakely decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of improperly storing items in his yard. After he was convicted, defendant sought review. He contended that Bemidji, Minn., Code of Ordinance &sect; 10.33 (2001) was unconstitutional. In affirming, the appellate court determined that there was no due process violation. The ordinance was not an unreasonable exercise of municipal police powers. Although &sect; 10.33 included aesthetic considerations, it also related to health and safety because old appliances and furniture constituted attractive nuisances and provided an ideal nesting place for rodents. Further, defendant's vagueness challenge was rejected because the ordinance defined the offense with sufficient definiteness so that an ordinary person could have understood what conduct was prohibited. Next, there was no discriminatory enforcement in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although defendant provided pictures of other houses that were apparently in violation, the record was silent as to whether anyone else had been charged. Finally, there was no allegation of an impermissible governmental purpose for singling defendant out for discriminatory prosecution.</SPAN></P>

The officers stopped the vehicle and observed that defendant's eyes were bloodshot and watery, that his breath smelled of alcohol, and that his speech was slurred. The appellate court ruled that the circumstances provided a reasonable, articulable basis for the officers' suspicion that defendant had engaged in an alcohol-related driving offense, and the officers' inquiry was reasonably extended beyond its original purpose. Based on the officers' training and experience, a punched-out door lock supported a suspicion that the car was stolen.

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the juvenile court erred by finding probable cause that he committed two of the charged offenses--first-degree aggravated robbery, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.245, subd. 1 (2004), and assault for the benefit of a gang, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.229, subd. 2 (2004)--and by granting the State's adult-certification motion. He also challenged the constitutionality of the presumptive-certification statute on equal protection grounds. Defendant's case was appropriate for presumptive certification because probable cause supported the aggravated robbery and crime-for-the-benefit-of a-gang charges; the juvenile was 16 years old when he committed the alleged offenses; and the presumptive sentence for first-degree aggravated robbery was 48 months in prison. Further, the record supported the juvenile court's finding that defendant did not rebut the presumption that adult certification was appropriate in his case. The presumptive-certification statute did not violate equal protection because the imposition of a potentially more serious penalty on older offenders who committed more serious offenses served the statute's purpose as stated in Minn. Stat. &sect; 260B.001, subd. 2 (2004).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sherburne County District Court, Minnesota, convicted defendant of two counts of second-degree assault and imposed concurrent sentences of 36 months under former Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court did not have authority to submit sentencing interrogatories to the jury in order to impose an enhanced sentence under former Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11, subd. 4 (2004). Defendant also argued that the jury's findings were insufficient to justify imposition of the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the supreme court had recently held that the trial court had the inherent authority to allow the jury to make factual findings on aggravating sentencing factors before the legislature provided for sentencing juries. As such, the trial court properly exercised its inherent authority by submitting the enhancement factors, other than factors related solely to criminal history, to the jury. Furthermore, the words &quot;use or possess&quot; were specifically defined in the interrogatory to require that the weapon be somehow &quot;employed&quot; at the time of the commission of the crime. Therefore, inclusion of &quot;possess&quot; did not materially misstate the law and was not erroneous. And even if the wording of the interrogatory was erroneous, defendant failed to show that the wording affected his substantial rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and served a criminal sentence for attempted first-degree criminal sexual conduct of a mentally disabled victim. At a civil commitment hearing, the victim recanted her statements regarding the sexual assault. The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, committed defendant as a sexually dangerous person and denied his subsequent petition for postconviction relief based on the recantation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant challenged the denial of his petition for postconviction relief, arguing that the postconviction court erred in determining that the victim's recantation was not sufficiently credible to entitle him to a new trial. The appellate court disagreed, finding that because the victim's recantation occurred during a visit with defendant's mother in which the mother presented the victim a prepared recantation statement for the victim's signature, the postconviction court's determination that it was not reasonably certain that the recantation was genuine was well founded; the credibility of this recantation was also rejected for similar reasons during the civil commitment proceedings. Moreover, defendant, who had received police reports of the victim's account of the sexual assault during pretrial discovery, was not surprised by her trial testimony; nor could he claim that he did not know of the &quot;alleged falsity&quot; of the victim's testimony until after trial. Any alleged falsity in the victim's testimony was thoroughly aired for both defendant and the jury. Accordingly, defendant failed to establish that he was entitled to postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a billboard lessee, sought review of a decision of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which entered summary judgment in favor of respondent city on the lessee's challenge to the city's grant of a conditional use permit (CUP), pursuant to St. Louis Park, Minn., City Code &sect; 36-404(6)(b)(2) (2006), requiring that the lessee's billboard be removed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee argued that the city misinterpreted and misapplied its ordinance when it conditioned the CUP's approval on the billboard's removal. The application related to a multi-tenant building in which modifications changing the building's area, height, or density were not proposed; the billboard's presence was a nonconforming use. The CUP was granted subject to conditions to bring the site into greater compliance with the city's zoning ordinances. The state appellate court affirmed, finding that the city acted pursuant to its own ordinance, and that the city's action bore a reasonable relationship to the ordinance's purpose. Moreover, the city's extensive findings satisfied both its general obligations to set forth written reasons for granting the CUP, as well as the specific requirements of St. Louis Park, Minn., City Code &sect; 36-365(b) (2006). And, because the lessee had not been deprived of its property interest in its lease, its claim of a procedural due process violation failed. Finally, the lessee's property interest was not taken without just compensation in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V, Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 13; it did not have a compensable interest in the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appellate court affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had nothing to say after accepting the plea. The record and context of the hearing conclusively established that defendant pleaded guilty to attempted simple robbery. His factual admissions were sufficient to meet the elements of attempted simple robbery. The admissions were sufficient to establish a factual basis for his plea, and the plea was accurate. The record did not support defendant's allegations of retaliation or intimidation on the part of the trial judge. Even if the appellate court were included to collaterally review defendant's Michigan convictions, it was unable to do so based on the record before it. Defendant did not show that his trial counsel's conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Defendant did not claim that he was denied his right to postconviction counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the evidence that he surreptitiously entered the office of a convenience store was not sufficient to prove that he entered with the intent to steal. While there was no signage on the office door, there was no question that the office was not open to the public. However, appellant entered the office surreptitiously with gloves and a crow bar, removed the surveillance video from the VCR, opened file cabinet drawers, and moved the file cabinet. He also failed to comply with demands by an officer to come out of the office. This evidence, while circumstantial, supported the district court finding that appellant entered the office with the intent to steal was guilty of third-degree burglary under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.582, subd. 3 (2004). Appellant also argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. In support of his claim, he argued that his attorney was not effective because he failed to introduce evidence that supported appellant's case, refused to ask appellant's questions, and refused to mount a theory of defense requested by appellant. Appellant's argument failed, however, because Minnesota courts refused to second-guess counsel's trial tactics.</SPAN></P>

He saw the first man hand defendant money in exchange for the bag and saw the second man hand defendant curled paper that the officer believed was money. As officers pursued defendant, he threw a plastic bag containing ten smaller bags out of his hat. The ten smaller bags contained marijuana. The other men involved in the transactions were arrested, and were found to have small plastic baggies in their possession containing what was later verified to be marijuana; the bags resembled other bags of marijuana found in defendant's possession. The trial court stated that the packaging of the marijuana in individual bags and the number of the baggies made it &quot;clear&quot; that defendant &quot;had packaged them for sale to separate individuals.&quot; When considering that evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's verdict, the evidence was sufficient to find that the marijuana was given in exchange for money.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose out of the sexual assault of a seven-year-old girl by a stranger posing as an officially sponsored reading tutor. The inmate currently appealed from an order denying his postconviction petition that challenged his 2002 sentence for that offense. The sentence resulted from a double upward departure to 288 months' incarceration after a jury convicted him of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. He argued that the double departure was not supported by aggravating factors, but because the record supported the finding of aggravating factors to justify the double upward departure from the presumptive sentence, the appellate court affirmed. The evidence plainly demonstrated that the inmate engaged in predatory planning and manipulation to commit his crime. Additionally, once he had access to the victim, he manipulated her to a different part of the basement away from the other children and outside of her grandmother's presence. The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it identified the emotional and psychological trauma of the victim and the victim's grandmother as aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Sherburne County District Court (Minnesota), which, after a guilty plea, convicted him of theft and sentenced him to a 60-month term due to his career offender status.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to theft in one county and to receiving stolen property in another county. Both of these crimes stemmed from computers he had stolen from a retail store and pawned. He was given a 60-month sentence under the career offender provisions of Minn. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;609.1095, subd. 4 (2004). Thereafter, defendant sought review. In partially reversing, the appellate court held that &sect; 609.1095 was unconstitutional under Blakely as applied to defendant. His waiver of a jury determination was not proper. However, district court's exercise of its inherent authority to empanel a jury on sentencing was not precluded. Thus, the district court could decide whether to impose the presumptive sentence or to conduct proceedings, conforming with Blakely, on the question of an upward sentencing departure. Next, because the receiving stolen property offense dealt with only one of the thefts that he was charged with, and the theft charge was based on several thefts, they were separate incidents for sentencing purposes because any two of the thefts clearly totalled $ 500 or more, the minimum amount required for the theft conviction under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.52, subd. 3(3)(a) (2004).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed, but the sentence was reversed and remanded for a determination of whether to impose the presumptive sentence or conduct proceedings on the question of an upward sentencing departure.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The jury heard testimony from three people who lived in the victim's building at the time of the offense. Each dialed 911 separately to report a domestic disturbance in her apartment. The jury heard a recording of each 911 call. Defendant was in the building earlier in the evening, and the building manager escorted him out after hearing him arguing with the victim. The manager testified that, when she went to the victim's apartment to tell defendant to leave, the victim's face was red. Despite her later denials, jurors learned that after the alleged assault, the victim told police officers and medical personnel that defendant struck her repeatedly in the head with his fist, causing her to lose consciousness. Jurors heard that in 1998, officers responded to a 911 hang-up call from the victim's home. When they arrived, she told the officers that she had dialed 911 during an argument with defendant, but he tore the phone from her hand, disconnecting the receiver from the base of the phone. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to meet the statutory requirements for commitment as an SDP; (2) the SDP statute was void for vagueness; and (3) he presented sufficient evidence of an available less-restrictive alternative to indeterminate commitment. The instant court found no error in the trial court's determinations on the statutory elements or on the constitutionality of the SDP statute. The trial court's decision was based in part on its resolution of conflicting expert opinions on the use of actuarial risk instruments versus clinical judgment to assess recidivism. Both examiners questioned the value of actuarial risk instruments as applied to appellant. The trial court specifically found that, in appellant's case, age should not act as a mitigating factor, limited reliance should be placed on actuarial tools and statistics, and strong reliance should be placed on the evalulator's clinical judgment. Appellant's void-for-vagueness argument failed because the trial court made findings based on clear and convincing evidence that appellant's lack of control was tied to his mental disorder, which distinguished his commitment from typical recidivist cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued, inter alia, that the postconviction court erred by denying his petition for postconviction relief because he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to challenge the validity of the competency evaluation. Petitioner argued that his extensive history of mental illness and the newly discovered letter in his prison records cast doubt on the validity of the mental health evaluation. The court of appeals disagreed. Petitioner claimed that he was unaware of the letter until he was recently reviewing his prison records. However, it could have been discovered as he prepared for the original proceeding, the direct appeal, or any of the prior nine postconviction challenges. In addition, the evidence, even if newly discovered, was cumulative, doubtful, and unlikely to produce a different result. As the postconviction court noted, petitioner's mental health was &quot;nothing new&quot; to the case. The record indicated that the petitioner knew of his mental condition at the time of the direct appeal and when he filed the prior nine postconviction petitions in the Dakota County case.</SPAN></P>

She was ultimately convicted of harassment and was sentenced to 45 days' imprisonment, with 43 days stayed. Because defendant already served her three-day-executed sentence, her sentencing appeal was moot. The district court did not err when it denied her defense counsel's motion for a competency examination. A 2003 evaluation showed a finding of competency. She was not entitled to an interpreter at trial. There was no requirement that defendant take the stand before evidence of prior bad acts could be admitted under Minn. R. Evid. 404(b). Where defendant sought to remove the judge presiding over her case, the proper remedy was a writ of prohibition. The district court had authority to order a preliminary sentence investigation, and the sentence was not an abuse of discretion. The probation conditions were reasonably related to the sentence. Defendant introduced no evidence that would tend to support her argument that the prosecutor acted with an impermissible motive by filing the charges against her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which imposed an upward departure from the presumptive sentence for a second-degree criminal sexual conduct conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the criminal sexual conduct count, the district court sentenced defendant to the statutory maximum of 300 months, a fivefold upward departure from the presumptive 58-month sentence. The district court relied on its earlier judicial determination that defendant was a patterned sex offender, as defined in Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.108 (1998), to justify the upward departure. The district court also provided, as an alternative basis for defendant's sentence, that he met the definition of a repeat sex offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.109 (1998). On appeal, the court first determined that because the upward departure was based on judicial rather than jury findings under the patterned-sex-offender statute, and defendant's appeal was pending when Blakely was decided, defendant's sentence violated the Sixth Amendment. The court decided, however, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in its alternative ground for the sentence, application of the repeat-sex-offender statute. Defendant had three prior qualifying convictions rather than the single conviction required under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from an order for indeterminate commitment as a sexually dangerous person and a sexual-psychopathic personality issued by the Pennington County District Court (Minnesota), appellant argued that the use of evidence of his alleged history of sexual acts, obtained through his disclosure in a mandatory outpatient sex-offender program, violated his substantive due-process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1998, appellant pled guilty to first-degree criminal sexual conduct. When appellant was admitted to chemical-dependency and sexual-offender treatment, he signed a disclosure form in which the treatment staff required honest and full disclosure of uncharged sex offenses. In 2003, appellant was released from prison and placed on intensive supervised release, which was revoked after he tested positive for cocaine. Appellant was retested for likeliness to reoffend due to his recent disclosures. A psychologist recommended that appellant be assigned a &quot;high risk&quot; to re-offend sexually, noting his behavioral history, broad victim pool, and lack of rehabilitation from drug addiction. In 2005, the State sought appellant's civil commitment, alleging that he was a sexual-psychopathic personality (SPP) and a sexually dangerous person (SDP), as defined by Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subds. 18b-18c (2004). On appeal, the court determined that the statutes were narrowly tailored and did not violate appellant's substantive due-process rights. Commitment under Minnesota's civil-commitment statute was remedial because it was for treatment purposes and was not for purposes of preventive detention.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that his sentence for conspiracy to commit second-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, and second-degree assault was an upward departure imposed in violation of Blakely, his sentence was contrary to the sentencing guidelines, and he was improperly denied an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction arose out of a shooting that took place at an outdoor pool where children and adults were present and one of the onlookers was shot. The court initially affirmed the district court's denial of postconviction relief but remanded for reconsideration of the sentence in light of Blakely. On remand, appellant requested a sentencing hearing, which was denied. On appeal, the court stated that Blakely applied only prospectively to cases or appeals that were pending on direct review when Blakely was decided on June 24, 2004. Because appellant's sentence was final before the effective date of Blakely, it was not unconstitutional. In addition, because the upward departure in appellant's plea agreement and sentence was supported by the record, including appellant's admission that his conduct constituted a &quot;greater than normal danger to human life,&quot; the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant's postconviction petition. Finally, the court stated that because appellant had not alleged facts that would entitle him to relief, the postconviction court did not abuse its discretion by denying his petition for an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant trucking services companies filed a declaratory-judgment suit against respondents, the departments of labor and industry, administration, and transportation, challenging the validity of statutes relating to truck-rental rates and broker fees and the administrative rules adopted to implement and enforce the statutes. The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, granted the departments' motion for summary judgment. The companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the firms challenged the trial court's grant of summary judgment dismissing their claims, arguing that the trial court erred in ruling that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the declaratory-judgment action. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the companies did not identify any attempt to apply or enforce a rule against any particular party. Instead, they sought a declaration that applied to all participants in the competitive-bidding process, which was a challenge to the general validity of the rules. Therefore, the companies' declaratory-judgment action was a pre-enforcement challenge, and the trial court did not have jurisdiction. Further, the companies' allegations that they had been, and would be, forced to bid on, and quote prices for, projects with unlawful prevailing wage requirements and forced to pay truck rental rates and operating costs that might not lawfully be imposed, simply stated their interpretations of Minn. Stat. &sect; 177.42, subd. 6 (2004), and Minn. Stat. &sect; 177.44, subd. 3 (2004). They did not show how the statutes had been, or were about to be, applied to their disadvantage. As such, the companies did not have standing.</SPAN></P>

The deputy stopped a vehicle in which defendant was a passenger. The driver had not violated any traffic laws. The police asked the occupants to return to their home to discuss the allegation. When they arrived, defendant rushed toward the house where she was living with the driver of the vehicle. The deputy took the agreement to return to the residence as permission to enter the house. The driver gave the deputy permission to search the residence. The search uncovered a small amount of Oxycodone and drug paraphernalia. While being questioned, defendant made incriminating statements. The trial court erred by denying her motion to suppress evidence. The deputy did not have reasonable suspicion to justify an investigatory stop of the vehicle defendant was riding in. Thus, the contraband found at the house was &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree,&quot; and had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was stopped for driving while intoxicated, read the implied-consent advisory, and submitted to a breath test that indicated an alcohol concentration of .10. The driver's license was revoked, and the driver petitioned for judicial review. The implied-consent hearing was scheduled, but the commissioner requested a continuance because the arresting officer was not available. The hearing was rescheduled, and the commissioner contacted the driver's attorney who agreed to the new hearing date. The commissioner offered to stay the balance of the revocation of the driver's driving privileges, but the driver's attorney declined the offer. The driver argued that because her implied-consent hearing was held 82 days after she filed her petition for review, her driver's license revocation should be rescinded. The court noted that Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.53, subd. 2(c) (2002), provided that if a hearing was not conducted within 60 days, the reviewing court could order a stay of the balance of the revocation. Thus, the remedy for not conducting a timely hearing was not rescission of the revocation, but a stay of the balance of the revocation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent public agency employees sought review of their termination decisions, and respondent Bureau of Mediation Services ordered arbitration. Appellants, the agency and the County, sought a declaration that the Bureau lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to determine the employees' claims. The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, dismissed the declaratory-judgment action for lack of jurisdiction. The agency and the County appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the agency and the County argued, inter alia, that the district court erred in determining that it lacked original jurisdiction to consider the scope and constitutionality of the independent-review statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 179A.25 (2004), as applied to the former employee's employment grievances; and &sect; 179A.25 did not provide the Bureau of Mediation Services with an independent right to review quasi-judicial employment decisions by public employers. The appellate court disagreed, holding first that certiorari appeals permitted appellate consideration of a public authority's jurisdiction to act. Furthermore, the County and the agency cited no authority that allowed the agency to challenge the decision of the Bureau, an agency with statewide jurisdiction, in district court. Because the County and the agency improperly sought to challenge a threshold determination by the Bureau in district court, rather than by a timely certiorari appeal pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 606.01 (2004) to the appellate court from a final agency decision, the district court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear their claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant guest sought review of a summary judgment of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) in favor of respondents, a corporation and a city, in the guest's action alleging discrimination under the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA) and violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 arising out of police officers' handling of a domestic dispute at an apartment where the guest was visiting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guest was asked to step into the hallway. After he did so, officers conducted a pat search for weapons. The female tenant, however, was not asked to step into the hallway. On appeal, the court first determined that the guest's allegations against the corporation failed to set forth a claim under the MHRA. The housing and real estate protections of the MHRA extended only to the sale, rental, or lease of real property, and did not create a cause of action for guests of tenants. In addition, public accommodations did not include apartment complexes. The district court therefore did not err by granting summary judgment to the corporation. Next, the court concluded that the district court did not err by granting summary judgment to the city. The difference in treatment of the guest and the tenant appeared to be based not on gender, but on tenancy. In addition, because the guest alleged that both he and the tenant suffered from psychological disabilities, it was less likely that the guest was singled out because of his disability. Finally, the court held that district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the guest's motion to compel discovery from respondents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On May 24, 2005, a police officer observed a vehicle driving east on a road without its headlights on.

The officer observed that defendant smelled of alcohol, that he had glassy and bloodshot eyes, and that his speech was slurred. After admitting that he had been drinking alcoholic beverages, defendant failed field sobriety tests and a preliminary breath test. The officer arrested him for driving while impaired by alcohol. The officer read defendant the implied-consent advisory, and defendant submitted to an Intoxylizer test. The Intoxylizer test results indicated that he had an alcohol concentration of 0.18. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and the denial of his motion to suppress because while the 2003 amendments to Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which sentenced him, following his guilty plea to theft of more than $ 2,500. Defendant challenged the constitutional validity of an upward durational departure, the proportionality of the departure to the conviction offense, and the imposition of consecutive sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant waived his right to a jury determination of sentence-enhancement factors under the career-offender statute. Defendant was sentenced to 110 months as a career offender based on a judicial finding that he had at least five prior felony convictions and that his current offense for theft was committed as part of a pattern of criminal conduct. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that his waiver was unenforceable because the career-offender statute was facially unconstitutional and no statutory authority existed that would provide a basis for his upward departure. Blakely expressly permitted a defendant to waive his Sixth Amendment right to a jury and to consent to judicial factfinding of sentence-enhancement factors. Defendant's prior convictions for theft crimes and evidence of a marketing operation in which he resold stolen items justified the district court's determination that defendant was a career offender within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 4 (2004). Finally, the court determined that the record supported the State's acknowledgement that defendant did not waive his right to have a jury determine whether he was a major economic offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the sentence duration but, consistent with the joint request of defendant and the State, the court reversed the district court's consecutive-sentencing order and remanded that order for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's petition challenged his sentence for first-degree controlled-substance crime, arguing that he was subjected to double jeopardy, received ineffective assistance of counsel, and had been denied sentence reductions promised during his plea agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant did not challenge the administrative forfeiture of the cash that police found at the time of his arrest. In his postconviction petition, appellant argued that the cash forfeiture and criminal conviction represented unconstitutional double jeopardy. The court rejected his argument. It noted that appellant did not follow the procedures outlined in the forfeiture statute. Because appellant failed to make the requisite showing for a double-jeopardy claim, the district court properly denied his requested postconviction relief. The court also found that appellant's assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel was without merit and could not save his double-jeopardy claim. The court next determined that appellant's contention that his sentence lacked factual foundation. Finally, the court rejected appellant's argument that the district court erroneously failed to provide him an evidentiary hearing to address his postconviction claims, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.04, subd. 1 (2004). The court noted, in part, that it was appellant's second postconviction petition and he had not appealed the denial of his first petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a priest. Defendant moved to sever the charges, and the district court divided the charges into two trials: the charges of fifth-degree criminal sexual conduct, indecent exposure, theft and theft by swindle were to be tried in trial I, and the two charges of third-degree criminal sexual conduct were to be tried in trial II. Defendant argued that the district court failed to sever the third-degree criminal sexual conduct charges against two victims, however, the appellate court ruled that the district court did not abuse its discretion in joinder of the two offenses. The record contained strong evidence that defendant participated in the offenses, and the evidence of each offense was relevant to both of the State's cases because of the similarities in modus operandi. Also, the appellate court overruled the argument that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.344, subd. 1(l)(ii) (2002), was void for vagueness. Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.344, subd. 1(l)(ii), was sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that a member of the clergy, or one who purported to be a member of the clergy, could not engage in sexual penetration when the complainant was seeking advice, aid, or comfort.</SPAN></P>

The officers then escorted him to the basement of the house to conduct a search incident to arrest. Officers found more heroin and a gun. On appeal, the court noted that the officers conducting the search were aware that drugs had been sold out of the residence, known drug users frequented the residence, the residence was being used as a base for various drug dealers, and a confidential informant had made a controlled heroin buy at the residence. The court concluded that the district court did not err when it determined that police officers reasonably believed defendant posed a threat of immediate harm sufficient to justify defendant's detention and frisk. Nor did it err when it determined that the police had probable cause to arrest defendant after finding the heroin. The court concluded that the district court did not err when it denied the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that district court acted within its sound discretion when it denied the driver's motion for a continuance. The driver and his attorney had ample time to discuss their strategy, and, if necessary, seek a continuance well in advance of the hearing. With respect to evidentiary rulings, the court stated that it was within the district court's discretion to determine which witnesses were competent to testify. Also, the commissioner's affidavits were admissible under Minn. R. Evid. 803(8)(c), the public-records exception to the hearsay rule. The court rejected the driver's assertion that he was denied the right to a jury trial. Minn. Stat. &sect; 171.19 (2004) specifically stated that a petition for driver's-license reinstatement &quot;shall be heard by the court without a jury.&quot; In addition, the Minnesota Constitution did not provide the right to a jury trial for reinstatement of a driver's license. Finally, the court stated that the prehearing revocation procedures of &sect; 171.19 did not violate procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made several general pretrial motions to suppress evidence allegedly obtained in violation of the laws of Minnesota and the United States. Defendant did not, however, argue that the district court should suppress the evidence because police relied on an unconstitutional implied-consent statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.53, subd. 3a (2002). Therefore, that issue was not properly before the court. In addition, the court concluded defendant's argument failed on the merits. The 2003 amendments to &sect; 169A.53, subd. 3a, eliminated the time-frame requirement for holding a postrevocation hearing. The amendments were found unconstitutional, however, and the Minnesota Supreme Court then revived the implied-consent statute that existed immediately prior to the amendments. Thus, the implied-consent statute remained in effect. The court concluded that the district court did not err in denying defendant's motions to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Human Services and Public Health Department filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of appellant parents. When the parents failed to appear for a hearing, the Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, entered a default judgment granting the Department's motion to terminate their parental rights. The parents motion to vacate was denied. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the parents raised several issues challenging the denial of their motion to vacate the default order and arguing that the termination of their parental rights lacked evidentiary support. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the evidence provided strong support that the mother was palpably unfit, including her significant, continuing history of drug abuse, lack of contact with the child since his birth, and her failure to comply with the voluntary case plan. While the father had no prior history of child-protection matters, and there were no allegations that he abused drugs, it was undisputed that he failed to cooperate with the voluntary case plan, and failed to have any contact with the child or to provide any support, financial or otherwise. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to find that the father abandoned the child as defined in Minn. Stat. &sect; 260C.301, subd. 1(b)(1) (2004). Both parents also failed to demonstrate a reasonable excuse for their failure to appear at the hearing, and offered no evidence to support their claim that they arrived at the courthouse on time but were misdirected by a court employee.</SPAN></P>

The chief stopped the vehicle, identified the passenger, confirmed the outstanding warrant, and arrested him. After she arrested the passenger, the chief asked defendant for her driver's license, which defendant was unable to produce. The chief verified that defendant's driving privileges had been suspended; defendant was arrested for one count of driving a motor vehicle after suspension, a violation of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 171.20, subd. 2, .24, subd. 1 (2004), and one count of driving without a valid driver's license in her possession, a violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 171.08 (2004).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer sought reconsideration, pursuant to Minn. R. Gen. Prac. Dist. Ct. 115.11, of the court's order granting respondent county's motion to dismiss the taxpayer's petition contesting the tax assessment of its property, a mall. In that order, the court concluded that the information supplied by the taxpayer was insufficient under Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.05, subd. 6(a) (the 60 Day Rule).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county requested information from the taxpayer, including the 15 leases for tenants occupying the mall. The taxpayer's response included a lease abstract for the tenants but did not include the individual leases. On reconsideration of the court's dismissal of the taxpayer's petition, the court first stated that motions for reconsideration were reserved for instances where intervening legal developments had occurred or where the earlier decision was palpably wrong in some respect. The court determined that it had not erred in reaching its earlier decision. In part, the court stated that the taxpayer never asserted a necessity that the documents be maintained in their current location or that sending the documents presented an undue burden. The information the taxpayer gave did not meet the requirements of the 60 Day Rule because the taxpayer provided nothing to refute the county assessor's view that in a distressed mall with only 15 leases, the information contained in the leases was an important part of the appraisal process. Finally, the court stated that the taxpayer's due process rights were not violated by a strict construction of the 60 Day Rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's petition for postconviction relief challenged his sentencing departure under Blakely and argued, for the second time on postconviction review, that he suffered from a mental illness at the time of the offense. On appeal, the court stated that the district court could summarily deny a defendant's second or successive petition for similar relief and could summarily deny a petition when the issues raised in it had previously been decided by the Court of Appeals pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.04, subd. 3 (2004). The court noted that appellant raised his mental-illness claim in his first postconviction petition and on subsequent appeal to the court. The court concluded that the postconviction court did not abuse its discretion by summarily dismissing the same claim in appellant's current petition. The court next noted that appellant's direct appeal was final when the Minnesota Supreme Court denied his petition for review. Because Blakely was decided after that judgment became final, appellant was not entitled to its application in a postconviction proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions, arguing that the affidavit in support of the search-warrant application was insufficient to support authorization for a nighttime search because it did not make a particularized showing of reasonable suspicion to justify a nighttime search and it impermissibly relied on boilerplate language. The court disagreed and affirmed however, stating that the affidavit was sufficient under U.S. Const. amend. IV, Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Minn. Stat. &sect; 626.14 (2004). The affidavit indicated that, within 72 hours prior to the application for the search warrant, defendant told an informant that he was in the process of making methamphetamine, and the informant saw materials used to manufacture methamphetamine in defendant's residence. The informant also advised the deputy that defendant was employed during the day and, as a result, would be making methamphetamine at night. That information was particular to defendant and provided reasonable suspicion on which to authorize a nighttime search. Additionally, the affidavit at issue contained more than just boilerplate language.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed defendant's sentence and remanded for resentencing consistent with the presumptive sentence in the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines as Minn.

Stat. &sect; 152.025, subd. 2 (2002). Appellant argued, in part, that: 1) there was no basis for detaining him in the back seat of a police car; and 2) appellant's identity should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One night, a police officer stopped appellant's car for speeding. The officer had reason to suspect that appellant gave him false information regarding his identity. Appellant was placed in the police car for 10 minutes while the officer investigated further. Once he obtained appellant's true identity, the officer discovered outstanding arrest warrants and conducted a vehicle search, finding cocaine and drug paraphernalia. Appellant argued that his detention in the police car violated his rights under the Minnesota Constitution and led to the allegedly improper discovery of his identity and, therefore, improper discovery of the outstanding felony arrest warrants, and the cocaine and drug paraphernalia. On appeal, the court agreed that placing appellant in the police car was an unwarranted intrusion on appellant's personal liberties. The court decided, however, that the exclusionary rule was inapplicable because the drug evidence was discovered not as the result of the unreasonable confinement of appellant in the police car but as the result of learning appellant's identity, which would have happened even if appellant were not inside the vehicle during those 10 minutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for driving 70 miles per hour in a 55 mile per-hour zone. The officer could smell alcohol on defendant and noticed beer cans in the back seat of the car. A driver's-license check revealed that defendant had a restricted driver's license requiring him to abstain completely from alcohol or other drug use, even when not driving. Defendant admitted that he had consumed four beers the previous day, and a preliminary breath test (PBT) indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.055. The appellate court ruled that because defendant was not in custody at the time he made statements to the officer, he was not entitled to receive a Miranda warning. Defendant neither cited any authority, nor was the appellate court aware of any, to support defendant's assertion that the officer's failure to hand him a speeding citation converted the routine traffic stop into a situation in which he was restrained in a manner comparable to a formal arrest. Also, defendant's assertion that the right to counsel at the PBT stage was contrary to governing caselaw.

The officer followed defendant and observed him again accelerate from a stop sign at a high rate of speed. The officer heard the engine of defendant's vehicle rev loudly. Crystal, Minn., City Code ch. XIII, &sect; 1305.07 (1994) stated that it was unlawful to accelerate any motor vehicle with an unnecessary exhibition of speed. The officer testified that defendant's driving conduct was an indicator that the driver was under the influence of alcohol. The district court erred by determining the officer did not have reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop the defendant.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 609.66, subd. 1d(a) (2004). The student, a juvenile, argued that the weapon seized from her backpack had to be suppressed and that the evidence was insufficient to support the delinquency adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dean of students at the student's high school had a meeting scheduled with the student. When the student failed to arrive, the dean looked for her. The dean found the student, who smelled strongly of cigarette smoke, in a school hallway. The student admitted that she had been smoking in violation of school rules. The dean then searched the student's purse, backpack, and locker. The dean found a lighter in the student's purse and a small folding knife in her backpack. The student admitted that the knife was hers but stated that she did not realize that the knife was in her backpack. On appeal, the court first determined that the search of the student's backpack that resulted in the seizure of her knife did not violate the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement for a search of a student at school. Because the search was justified at its inception and its scope was reasonable under the circumstances, the district court did not err by denying the student's motion to suppress the knife. The court also found that the evidence was sufficient. Although the student denied knowledge of the knife's location, the court deferred to the district court's assessment of her credibility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court was required to find, but did not find, that &quot;severe aggravating factors existed&quot; to support the sentencing departure. The court of appeals disagreed. The record showed that the victim was bound, gagged, and beaten by several individuals. The victim was repeatedly kicked in the head by defendant, received an implicit death threat from defendant when he asked where his gun was, she was confined to the trunk of her own car, was taken to an alley, and was shot twice with a shotgun at close range and left for dead. The victim testified that, as a result, she had permanently lost the use of one of her arms and suffers from continuing fear and psychological damage. However, the State's oral representations to the district court regarding defendant's Illinois conviction and probation were not evidence and the probation officer's statements were not sufficient when the documents that the probation officer relied on were neither attached nor identified. Therefore, the district court's criminal history finding was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the judgment pertaining to the Illinois conviction and probation was reversed. The case was remanded for resentencing. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota), which imposed an enhanced 360-month sentence for criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. Defendant based his appeal on the ground that the sentence was imposed under a statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.109, subd. 4 (2004), that had been declared unconstitutional by the Minnesota Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that defendant raped a woman. The jury answered in the affirmative to a question regarding whether defendant had penetrated the woman multiple times. Before sentencing, the State brought a motion pursuant to &sect; 609.109, which required that the district court impose a 30-year minimum sentence for certain repeat sex offenders if it found, at the time of sentencing, that an aggravating factor existed that provided grounds for an upward departure under the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines. The district court imposed an enhanced sentence, justifying the sentence by reference to the uncontested fact of a previous sex-offense conviction and to the jury's finding that defendant's crime involved multiple penetrations, an aggravating sentencing factor under &sect; 609.109, subd. 4(i). On appeal, the court agreed with defendant's argument that the enhanced sentence imposed pursuant to &sect; 609.109 had to be reversed because the Minnesota Supreme Court had held that statute to be facially unconstitutional. The court lastly noted that while the sentencing guidelines were a legislative creation, sentencing departures had historically been within the inherent powers of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded for resentencing, noting that the district court would have the opportunity to determine whether defendant was entitled to the presumptive sentence or whether another sentencing disposition was available.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. After reunification, the children stopped receiving their medication, and they ran away twice. The second time they ran away, they were found sleeping in the lobby of an apartment building. The guardian ad litem testified that not reunifying mother and the children was in the children's best interests, as was keeping the children in their current placement. The guardian ad litem also testified that she was &quot;torn&quot; between recommending long term foster care (LTFC) and termination because she believed that it was in the children's best interests to stay with the current foster parent, but, because that foster parent indicated that she did not currently want to adopt the children, that would require LTFC which was less stable than adoption. It was undisputed that the children preferred to remain with the current foster parent. Therefore, the trial court did not err by terminating the mother's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The district court found that the second Linehan factor, the patient's history of violent behavior, including the recency, severity, and frequency of violent acts, supported a finding of high risk. The district court found, as did both experts, that the patient did not accept responsibility for the assaults, minimized his behavior, saw himself as more of a victim than his victims, and lacked empathy and remorse. An expert found that the patient was in the moderate- to high-risk category, and that he remained at a relatively high risk to reoffend. The district court also found that the patient never began, let alone completed, a sex-offender treatment program. The patient's participation in treatment programs had been inconsistent and his prognoses was poor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual, who had a lengthy history of treatment for mental illnesses and chemical dependency, was initially civilly committed in October 2002. In October 2005, a mental health case supervisor filed a petition for judicial recommitment of the individual as mentally ill. The district court granted the petition. The individual appealed, arguing that a finding of recent dangerous behavior was required for recommitment as mentally ill. The court disagreed and affirmed. The district court did not err by ordering the recommitment of the individual under &sect; 253B.13, subd. 1 because Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.12, subd. 4, expressly provided that the district court did not have to find that there had been a recent attempt or threat to physically harm himself or others. Serial recommitments under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.13 did not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because a person committed as mentally ill could not be committed for more than one year without a petition and hearing. For each recommitment petition, the district court had to conclude that the patient continued to be mentally ill and was likely to harm himself or others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver sought review of a judgment of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which sustained the revocation his driver's license pursuant to the implied-consent law and which rejected his procedural due process challenge to the implied-consent advisory. Defendant received notice of the revocation of his license following his arrest for DWI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to that judicial district's policy, the criminal matter had to be resolved before the driver's petition for judicial review could be heard. An implied-consent hearing was scheduled more than 60 days after the filing of the petition, and the driver then continued the hearing twice. On appeal, the driver argued in his brief that because his license revocation occurred under the version of the implied-consent law that was subsequently declared unconstitutional, his revocation was unconstitutional. At oral argument, the driver acknowledged that the issue had since been resolved against him in an opinion issued after briefing was completed. That opinion stated that when the postrevocation hearing was not held within the 60-day period in Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.53, subd. 3(a) (2002), the remedy was a stay of the revocation of the driver's license, not rescission of the revocation. The court last noted that the driver's challenge to the district court policy regarding postrevocation hearings was not properly before the court because the district court did not rule on it and his arguments were made for the first time at oral argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that he had been consuming alcohol, and he failed field sobriety tests and a preliminary breath test. After police read defendant the implied-consent advisory and he consulted with an attorney, defendant refused to consent to testing. Defendant moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that his right to due process had been violated because the implied-consent advisory failed to inform him that refusal to submit to testing could result in a more severe criminal charge than failing the test. The district court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, concluding that Minnesota's current implied-consent advisory did not violate due process by failing to inform a driver that refusal to submit to testing could result in a harsher penalty than failing the test. The appellate court ruled that the district court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss. The Minnesota Supreme Court had upheld the constitutionality of the implied-consent statute. The implied-consent advisory did not actively mislead the driver as to his legal obligations or implicitly assure the driver that the penalties for test refusal were less serious than the penalties for test failure.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The same set of circumstances referred to the set of circumstances that provided the basis for the felony charge in the original complaint or petition. It was not limited to individual events that proved elements of the felony violation but rather included the entire course of events described in the complaint or petition. The facts that provided the factual basis for the offense of conviction must have occurred during the course of events that were described in the complaint or the petition, and the charged offense and the offense of conviction must have been united in time and place. The facts that provided the factual basis for the plea occurred during the course of events described in the complaint charging petitioner with kidnapping and criminal sexual conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who never had a Minnesota license to practice law, was convicted for attempting to reach a settlement with the first victim on behalf of a client and for filing a complaint against the second victim on behalf of another client. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 481.02 was constitutional because it did not violate the separation of powers clause of Minn. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, as it merely identified who could be prosecuted for the unauthorized practice of law. To the extent that Minn. Stat. &sect; 481.02 defined what actions constituted the practice of law, the court recognized the validity of &sect; 481.02 as a matter of comity. Section 481.02 did not violate due process because it provided an extensive list of acts that were prohibited as the unauthorized practice law, including those that led to defendant's conviction, and therefore it was not void for vagueness. Section 481.02 was not an ex post facto law because it was in effect at the time of the actions for which defendant was convicted, and it neither increased the punishment after defendant was convicted nor did it deprive defendant of a defense that was available when she committed the offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court sentenced defendant to 84 months in prison, a 36-month upward durational departure from the presumptive sentence for her conviction of criminal vehicular homicide in violation of Minn.

Defendant appealed but the court affirmed, stating that by using the bifurcated-trial procedure to submit aggravating factors to the jury, the district court did not infringe on legislative authority. Instead, the district court exercised its judicial discretion in the case by imposing a sentence that, although an upward durational departure, was within the limits prescribed by the legislature. That court used its inherent authority to regulate trial procedure to comply with the constitutional mandate of Blakely. The district court had the inherent authority to impanel a sentencing jury to determine whether any aggravating factors existed to support an upward durational departure from the presumptive sentence. The court further stated that defendant had notice of the possibility that her sentence could have been greater than the presumptive sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a pretrial order dismissing the complaint against defendant charging him with two counts of third-degree DWI, the State argued that the district court clearly erred in ruling that the police officer did not have a reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop defendant's car. The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings, holding that the totality of the circumstances supported the investigatory stop of the vehicle. Two 911-callers gave defendant's license plate. One caller observed a hit-an-run accident and the other stated that the same vehicle was swerving all over the road. Thus, the investigatory stop appeared to be properly supported by the presumed reliability of the informants as well as the substance of the information provided by the informants. Additionally, the officer made eye contact with defendant, motioning him to pull over. Defendant ignored the officer's attempts to pull him over. The officer was only able to stop the vehicle as it was trying to leave a cul-de-sac.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with fifth-degree possession of a controlled substance. He moved to suppress the marijuana seized by the police. The trial court denied the motion. He was convicted and received a stayed sentence of 15 months' imprisonment. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in failing to suppress the marijuana seized during an investigatory stop. The presence of a stolen vehicle at a residence that was a known drug house was sufficient to establish a particularized and objective basis to suspect criminal activity. Defendant's proximity to the stolen vehicle justified a limited intrusion to investigate evidence of at least two criminal offenses: evidence of criminal theft and possession of stolen property. An investigatory stop of the persons in the vicinity of the stolen vehicle was justified at its inception. Further, the police officers were outnumbered by the people at the residence. It was after dark, and they were on the premises where multiple searches and arrests for narcotics offenses and other offenses had occurred. A patdown search of defendant for officer safety was not an unreasonable expansion of the scope of the stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his racketeering conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. The evidence was sufficient to show the ongoing, continuing nature of the group. The record contained testimony that there was a structure to the group responsible for acquiring, and in some cases, manufacturing drugs; bailing members out of jail; continuing the business of jailed members; handling money; and providing transportation, lodging, and other necessary support to group members. The evidence also demonstrated that defendant was one of the principals in the organization. Defendant was primarily responsible for obtaining drugs in Chicago and Minneapolis and bringing them to the Fargo-Moorhead area. There was testimony that defendant advised members about how to sell drugs and had a role in dividing drugs among group members.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions of and sentences for aiding and abetting two of the sales were vacated. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the driver contended, inter alia, that the officers lacked probable cause to search her boyfriend's residence and to arrest her for violating the impaired-driving statutes. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the warrantless search was valid under the emergency aid and consent exceptions as the officers were trained paramedics who, based on their observation of the severely damage vehicle and their interviews of the witnesses, believed that the occupant (the driver) may have sustained injuries that required emergency aid. Furthermore, the evidence showed that the driver gave her consent to the officers' entry under her apparent authority. The officers also had probable cause to arrest the driver based on evidence that she was involved in a one-vehicle accident in a driveway, suggesting impairment, and other indicia of impairment recognized by the officers during their initial conversation with her: a strong odor of alcohol, bloodshot and watery eyes, slurred speech, poor balance, and difficulty walking. The implied-consent advisory did not violate due process by failing to warn the driver that refusal could have resulted in harsher penalties than test failure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State troopers stopped defendant for a suspected violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.69 (2004), which governed mufflers and noise emitted by motor vehicles.

Defendant moved to suppress evidence of his intoxication, arguing that &sect; 169.69 was unconstitutionally vague and that there was no reasonable suspicion for the stop. The appellate court deferred the trial court's assessment of the testimony of the two state troopers who stated that defendant's motorcycle was emitting sharp popping, crackling, and/or barking sounds and that the motorcycle's exhaust noise was distinct from, and not blended into, the overall noise of the motorcycle's operation. Based on the troopers' testimony, the appellate court affirmed the determination that Minn.

He abused trusting relationships with children through coercion, manipulation, and grooming, and exhibited inconsistent attitudes toward his offenses, either denying that they occurred or attributing his conduct to alcohol. The respondent's failure of a victim-empathy course confirmed his inability to comprehend the consequences of his actions. Both experts testified to their opinion that, given the opportunity, the respondent would reoffend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sheriff deputy received a telephone call from a woman, fearing for her safety, who informed the deputy that her ex-husband was en route to her residence in an &quot;older black car.&quot; Approximately two hours later, the deputy conducted a stop of defendant's black car, which was driving towards and was five blocks from the woman's house and which had a male passenger. The deputy stopped the vehicle simply to investigate whether the ex-husband might be in the vehicle. While the deputy was conducting a status check on the passenger, he discovered that an outstanding warrant for defendant's arrest existed. He arrested her and then conducted a search of defendant's vehicle, finding methamphetamine. The State conceded that the initial stop violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States and Minnesota constitutions because it was not based on a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity. The court determined, however, that defendant's arrest was a result of the information received during the status check, not from the initial traffic stop.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners appealed the grant of summary judgment by the Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, to respondent Lake Minnetonka Conservation District (LMCD), to require the landowners to remove their dock that did not meet LMCD regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners owned 12 feet of lakeshore on Lake Minnetonka. It was undisputed that there has been a dock located on the property since the early 1930s, and the landowners had maintained a dock and moored a boat there since they purchased the property in 1990. It was also undisputed that the dock failed to meet current LMCD regulations because it was outside the landowners' authorized dock use area, which was a small triangular area as drawn by extension of the converging side lot lines into the lake, and because the extremely narrow width of the property made it nearly impossible to meet the five-foot side setback requirements. The appellate court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the LMCD because while Minn. Stat. &sect; 103B.611, subd. 3(6) (2004) gave the LMCD the authority to regulate the construction, installation, and maintenance of permanent and temporary docks and moorings, the LMCD regulations could not so restrict the landowners' riparian rights as to deny them access to the navigable waters of the lake. Thus, the matter was remanded to determine the extent of the landowners' riparian rights subject to reasonable enforcement of LMCD regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council determined that the systems were faulty, and the owners sought review via certiorari. In affirming, the appellate court determined that Corcoran, Minn., Mun. Code tit. V, &sect;&nbsp;50.03 (2005), which adopted Minn. R. 7080.0060, subpt. 3B(1) (2005), did not conflict with Minn. Stat. &sect; 115.55, subd. 5a(g). It did not state that local government could not have otherwise exercised discretion to make systems compliant with a city ordinance. Next, there was sufficient evidence to support the findings; an expert report was not arbitrarily rejected since it was misleading. Further, the findings of fact and conclusions of law did not constitute an unconstitutional bill of attainder. They were not the law, and it was not unlawful to single out a group for a legislative purpose. Section 115.55 did not violate Minn. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;2 because the rational basis test was satisfied, and the owners lacked standing to make such a challenge. Also, it was not violative of Minn. Const. art. XII, &sect;&nbsp;1 because it was not special legislation since all counties, cities, and towns were treated the same. Finally, the owners' due process rights were not violated since they had multiple hearings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempted burglary in the second degree, and possession or sale of stolen or counterfeit checks. The district court dismissed the burglary charge, and denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the officers' warrantless search of his vehicle. The appellate court ruled that the officers had probable cause to believe that defendant's vehicle would contain evidence of a crime. The appellate court would consider the hat, gloves, and tools in light of defendant's presence in a residential neighborhood in the middle of the night with his hand on the knob of a door that he did not have permission to open and his dubious explanation that he left his vehicle and stood next to the garage in order to get out of the wind. Also, when the district court announced the sentence, it acknowledged that the sentence was an upward durational departure, but did not state reasons supporting the departure. Since the district court failed to state the reasons for departure on the record, the case must be remanded for imposition of the presumptive sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who waived his right to a jury trial, argued that his sentences reflected unconstitutional enhancement under the U.S. Supreme Court Blakely decision. On the conviction of assault in the second degree, the district court imposed the presumptive sentence of 45 months. The appellate court ruled that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11 did not apply as an aggravating factor and defendant's sentence for assault in the second degree was not unconstitutional under Blakely. Concerning the conviction of a prohibited person in possession of a firearm, Blakely was not implicated and defendant's sentence was proper. The sentence was not enhanced by any other fact not submitted at the trial and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The district court, thus acting as the trier of fact, found that defendant pulled a gun from his sweatshirt and twice pointed it at a parking-lot-security guard who later positively identified defendant as the person who pointed the gun at him. Also, based on defendant's stipulation that in 2003 he was convicted of a fifth-degree controlled-substance crime, the district court found defendant was guilty of being a prohibited person in possession of a handgun.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Even without the hearsay testimony, the jury had substantial evidence on which to base its conviction. The victim identified defendant (her father) as the abuser and testified to the specific acts of abuse. Furthermore, the forensic evidence matched defendant's DNA. He had several relatively inconsistent explanations of the event, which likely created for him substantial credibility issues. Defendant told an officer that the victim was peeking in his bedroom door watching him masturbate and that she had seen the pornographic movie when she was peeking. But the officer presented photographs of the room that indicated a person would have to be inside the room in order to view the television from the doorway. When asked how his DNA came to be on the victim's underwear, defendant answered that he grabbed some dirty laundry out of the hamper to wipe himself off. When asked why he allowed the victim to wear the soiled underwear, defendant explained that she dressed herself and he normally did not check to see what she was wearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which convicted him of third- and fifth-degree controlled-substance crime, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 152.023, subd. 2(1), and 152.025, subd. 2(1) (2002). On appeal, defendant argued that his jury-trial waiver was invalid and that his sentence enhancement was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to increase defendant's sentence under the firearm-enhancement statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11, subd. 5(a) (2002). The district court determined that the firearm-enhancement statute applied, so it sentenced defendant to two concurrent 36-month sentences. On appeal, the court first concluded that defendant's waiver of his right to have prosecution witnesses testify in open court in his presence satisfied the constitutional requirements and the requirements of Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.01, subd. 3, alike. The court next determined that because defendant did not stipulate to the elements of the firearm-enhancement statute but instead exercised his rights identified in Rule 26.01, subd. 3, defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial did not need to incorporate waiver of those additional rights. Although the record did not show that defendant was informed of the elements of the firearm-enhancement statute, it did show that defendant understood his right to a jury trial to determine the enhancement factor and the consequences of waiving that right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer responded to a rear-end automobile collision. The rear car was operated by defendant. The officer asked defendant about licensure and car ownership, and proof of insurance. A glass jar containing marijuana and colorful glass pipes used to smoke marijuana were obtained from the car's glove box. The district court concluded that the officer's suggestion to open the glove box was repeated, prolonged, and became coercive, thus the evidence must be suppressed as fruit of an unlawful search. The State argued that the police did not seize defendant or search his car, and that defendant voluntarily revealed the contents of his glove box. The appellate court ruled that defendant did not voluntarily open his glove box. The officer's continued, express interest in the glove box, his physical intrusion into the car, and his final implied directive that defendant open the glove box, together established coercion. A reasonable person would feel compelled to obey the officer's specific instruction to open the glove box. The marijuana came into plain view because defendant opened the glove box, and he opened the glove box because the officer essentially directed him to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent contacted an attorney about making a will leaving most of his estate to the beneficiary, a charity. The will contained self-proving language. The will was signed by decedent, taken to a bank where his signature card was on file, two bank employees signed as witnesses, and the will was notarized. After the decedent's death, the relative challenged the will. The district court entered a judgment against her, and the relative sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the self-proved will statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 524.3-406(b) (2004), precluded the district court from asking whether the signature requirements were satisfied. Only proof of fraud or forgery could have invalidated the self-proving will provisions. Even though the witnesses and the notary misrepresented their function in the case, this did not necessarily amount to fraud. Next, &sect; 524.3-406(b) was constitutional and did not amount to a procedural due process violation. The relative did not have a constitutionally protected interest in insuring that notaries and witnesses complied with the law for the execution of wills. There was a rational purpose in simplifying the probate of estates.</SPAN></P>

After a blood test showed an alcohol concentration of .10 or more, the driver's operating privileges were revoked for 90 days, effective January 1, 2005, under the implied-consent law. The driver petitioned for judicial review on January 11, 2005, and the matter was set for hearing on February 11, 2005. The hearing was continued at the driver's request, and rescheduled without objection to April 22, 2005. In May 2005, the 2003 legislative amendments to the implied-consent statute were found to have violated due-process guarantees. In the driver's case, the parties' memoranda were filed after the judicial decision was released. The driver argued that the revocation of his driver's license should be rescinded because it occurred under a statute that was found to have violated due process. The appellate court ruled that the 2002 law was the law that applied to the driver because that law remained in full force and effect as if the 2003 amendments had never been enacted. There was no specific pronouncement of prospective application in the judicial opinion, so the general rule of retroactive application applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Dakota County District Court, Minnesota, convicted defendant of offering a forged check in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.631, subds. 3, 4(3)(b) (2004). After the jury found that defendant's offense of offering a forged check was part of a pattern of criminal conduct, the trial court sentenced him to 45 months in prison under the career-offender statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095 (2004). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant raised several issues challenging the trial court's failure to exclude hearsay statements and a specific unanimity instruction, and argued that the trial court erred in crafting a bifurcated sentencing procedure when the procedure was not authorized by statute. While the trial court should not have admitted the testimony in question as it was not sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted under Minn. R. Evid. 803(24), the appellate court found that the error could not have affected the jury's decision, and defendant's substantial rights were not violated, as there was substantial evidence that the money orders were forged without relying on the witness's statements. And as each act set forth by the State independently satisfied the elements of the statutory offense and the acts were not alternative means of committing an element of the offense, the trial court's failure to provide a specific unanimity instruction was erroneous. The trial court could not use its inherent authority to submit the issue of whether defendant's current offense was part of a pattern of criminal conduct to the jury as the it lacked authority to craft a bifurcated sentencing procedure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, but his sentence was reversed and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The officer got in his car and pursued the car that was being driven by defendant. As the officer approached the vehicle, the driver, defendant got out of the vehicle and fell to the pavement. While talking with defendant, the trooper detected a strong odor of alcohol and observed that defendant's eyes were watery and bloodshot. He also noticed that defendant was slurring his speech. Defendant was read the Minnesota Motor Vehicle Implied Consent Advisory, and was given time to contact an attorney, but he was unable to do so. Defendant declined all requests to submit to testing on the basis that he could not reach his attorney. Defendant was charged with third-degree refusal to submit to chemical testing, and fourth-degree driving while under the influence. The dismissal of the gross-misdemeanor test-refusal count against defendant was reversed because defendant's due-process rights were not violated when the officer gave defendant a standard implied-consent advisory, but failed to inform defendant that refusal to submit to chemical testing for intoxication was a gross misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A golf course had been in existence for many years on certain land. The owners applied for an amendment to the city's comprehensive guide plan to allow for residential development thereon. The application was denied, and the owners filed a declaratory action and a petition for a writ of mandamus. The district court entered judgment against the city, and it sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the city's decision regarding land use was upheld unless it was unsupported by any rational basis relating to promoting the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. This test was satisfied because the city valued the open space; moreover, there were concerns about traffic and overcrowded schools. Next, the district court erred when it found that the denial of the application to amend the comprehensive guide plan amounted to an unconstitutional taking of property. The appellate court looked to the three factor test in Penn Central. There was no diminution in the value of the property, the expectation at the time of the purchase was to run a golf course, and the city intended to maintain its existing comprehensive plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an appeal from an order of the Scott County District Court (Minnesota), which dismissed a charge of gross-misdemeanor refusal to submit to chemical testing, the State argued that the district court erred by ruling that the implied-consent advisory required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.51, subd. 2(2) (2002) was unconstitutional because it failed to provide sufficient notice of the criminal consequences of refusing to submit to chemical testing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer found defendant in his vehicle slumped over the steering wheel and unresponsive at the side of a highway. The officer roused defendant and administered a preliminary breath test showing defendant's blood-alcohol concentration to be .185. At the police station, the officer read him the standard motor vehicle implied-consent advisory required by &sect; 169A.51. Defendant was then offered but refused to take an Intoxilyzer 5000 breath test, and he was charged with third- and fourth-degree DWI. Following an omnibus hearing, the district court dismissed the gross-misdemeanor charge of third-degree DWI (refusal to submit to testing) brought under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2 (Supp. 2003). On appeal, the court rejected defendant's arguments that the order dismissing the charge of third-degree DWI was not immediately appealable. Dismissal of a charge had a critical impact on the outcome of the trial. In addition, the court rejected his argument that Minnesota's standard implied consent advisory violated due process. Case law decided during the pendency of defendant's case stated that the implied-consent advisory did not actively mislead a driver.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The city claimed the Commission failed to consider avoided costs, that unlawful procedures were used, and that the award was unreasonable and was not supported by sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city challenged the Commission's loss-of-revenue award for future customers. The court held that the cooperative was entitled to future loss-of-revenue compensation in all the annexed areas pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 216.44, regardless of whether those areas contained existing customers, because the cooperative was currently providing electric service to all of the areas.  Also under Minn. Stat. &sect; 216B.40, the cooperative had the exclusive right to provide service to present and future customers. The court found that the Commission did not improperly exclude avoided costs for certain improvements and system upgrades because the cooperative asserted that it was adding lines and constructing a substation to serve the rest of its customers, regardless of the annexation, thus they were not avoided costs. The court held that the city's claim that the compensation award was unreasonably high, and arbitrary was premature because the record showed that the Commission had not yet made a decision regarding the compensation rate for future customers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. The court of appeals disagreed. All of the witnesses, other than defendant, testified that the victim moved aggressively toward defendant, who then punched him in the face. Although defendant denied punching the victim, he testified that he saw blood on the victim's lip. The trial court inferred from defendant's testimony that he had hit the victim. Also, the record supported a finding that defendant intentionally withdrew a knife from his pocket while struggling with the victim in a confined space, raised the knife, and stabbed the victim. In determining the issue of intent, the trial court reasonably inferred that defendant intended the natural and probable consequences of his actions. However, because the two assault convictions arose from a single behavioral incident, the sentence for second-degree assault was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found the petitioner guilty of first-degree attempted murder, second-degree attempted murder, and first-degree assault in October 1997. The district court sentenced the petitioner to 240 months in prison on the first-degree, attempted-murder conviction but did not impose separate sentences on the two remaining convictions. The 240-month sentence was an upward departure from the 210-month presumptive sentence under the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines. The district court based the departure on its finding that the petitioner acted with particular cruelty in committing the crime. The postconviction court granted the relief in part by vacating the second-degree, attempted-murder conviction. The appellate court ruled that the postconviction court properly denied the petition to vacate the petitioner's assault conviction because first-degree assault was not a lesser-included offense of first-degree attempted murder. Also, the petitioner's sentence was constitutionally permissible and the district court did not err by denying his petition for resentencing because the petitioner's convictions were final before the U.S. Supreme Court Blakely decision was issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was found inside of a vehicle that was in a ditch with the engine running. He had a blood alcohol level more than 3 times the legal limit. Drugs and paraphernalia were also found in his possession. He had been convicted of driving while impaired two other times. The county then sought to seize the vehicle, which was a dump truck. The district court granted summary judgment to the owner on the forfeiture case after finding that it was excessive in nature. The county then sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the forfeiture was not unconstitutionally excessive under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 or U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The Minnesota courts had adopted the &quot;gross disproportionality&quot; standard in Solem. There was a three-prong test used under that standard. Under the first factor, the facts of the case were particularly egregious, and the seizure of the dump truck did not destroy the owner's livelihood. Next, the second factor favored forfeiture as well because such fines were imposed for crimes of a similar serious nature. As to the third factor, the appellate court determined other states had forfeiture laws for driving while impaired cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police discovered images on defendant's home computer, and he was charged with 25 counts of possession of child pornography. After he was convicted of 23 counts and sentenced, defendant sought review. On appeal, the reviewing court rejected defendant's argument that Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.247, subd. 4 (2004) was unconstitutional under either the United States or the Minnesota Constitutions because defendant's only burden was one of production regarding the age of the persons depicted in the pornographic work. Next, the district court did not err by finding that the convictions constituted 18 separate behavioral incidents under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.035, subd. 1 (2004) because the acts took place at significantly different times. The sentence was reversed and remanded; however, because the factors on which the district court relied as the grounds for its departure were not based on facts admitted by appellant or found by a jury. Finally, the district court's ultimate conclusion that defendant was guilty of possessing child pornography &quot;on or about November 20, 2003&quot; was supported by the detailed findings that the images were either accessed or created within 43 days of November 20, 2003.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that defendant had not established the presence of sentencing manipulation. The investigation of defendant's sales did no more than ascertain whether defendant was willing and able to sell ten or more grams of methamphetamine in a 90-day period.

The police conducted an examination of an individual's hotel-registration information as authorized by Minn. Stat. &sect; 327.12 (2004). The privacy interest in the information, if any, belonged to that hotel registrant, not defendant, who was a guest in the room. Although the hotel registrant might have been able to assert a constitutional violation of her legitimate privacy interest in the hotel-registration records, defendant could not. Accordingly, defendant lacked standing to challenge a statutorily authorized review of the hotel registrant's hotel-registration form. Because defendant lacked standing to challenge the hotel-records investigation, that investigation could not have supplied the basis for suppressing evidence seized during the search of the hotel room. Additionally, exigent circumstances supplied a basis for the warrantless seizure of the cocaine and controlled substances in a sock.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged in Washington County with false imprisonment. While released on bail, appellant was involved in an incident in Anoka County resulting in felony charges. The Anoka County district court appointed a public defender to represent appellant. The public defender did not, however, appear before the Washington County district court, and that district court never formally appointed counsel to represent appellant. However, the petition to enter a guilty plea for the Washington County file indicated that appellant was represented by the Anoka public defender. On appeal, the court rejected appellant's argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying his postconviction petition. Although the public defender was not specifically appointed to the Washington County file, the court held that several factors demonstrated that to have been a mere insignificant oversight, including the fact that the public defender presented himself to the Anoka County district court as appellant's attorney on both matters.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties cohabited as partners in a romantic relationship for about 22 years, until they separated. During the relationship, the mother adopted two girls from China. The partner, who was of Chinese heritage, co-parented the children in the same household with the mother from the times of the respective adoptions until the parties' separation. During that period, the parties held themselves and the children out as a family unit, and the children viewed both parties as their parents, referring to each as &quot;mom.&quot; The appellate court ruled that the district court did not abuse its discretion in the visitation award. The evidence showed that the partner resided in the same household as the children for at least two years, and several witnesses testified to their personal observations that there existed between the partner and the children emotional ties indicative of the creation of a parent-child relationship. The district court narrowly applied Minn. Stat. &sect; 257C.08, subd 4 (2004) to a demonstrably qualified nonparent, and gave full effect to the children's best interests in awarding visitation. Also, the district court did not abuse its discretion in its order for therapy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident did not file federal or state income tax returns for the years 1996, 1997, 1998, although she received wages in those years. The Commissioner prepared returns on her behalf and assessed income tax, penalties, and interest for each year. The resident then sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that it had jurisdiction to hear the case because a proper Erie transfer procedure was conducted. In addition, the resident's argument that the assessment was invalid due to a failure to obtain information under Minn. Stat. &sect; 270.0603 was rejected as well. She was not entitled to a refund since she paid no taxes, and she was informed of the procedures for filing an appeal. Moreover, Minn. Stat. &sect; 271.06, subd. 6, and Minn. Stat. 289A.35 were not unconstitutional under the Minnesota and United States Constitutions. The resident had notice and an opportunity to be heard; therefore, her procedural due process rights were not violated. Substantive due process was also not violated based on the burden of proof placed on taxpayers. Finally, wages were taxable income, and the state had the authority and power to impose taxes upon them.</SPAN></P>

Because appellant's claim solely involved issues of law, he was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. The district court did not abuse its discretion in not conducting an evidentiary hearing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, one count of third-degree criminal sexual conduct, one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and one count of third-degree criminal sexual conduct. Defendant agreed to plead guilty to one third-degree count and be sentenced to 54 months, in exchange for dismissal of the other three counts. The agreed-on sentence represented a six-month upward departure from the presumptive sentence under the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines. The record reflected the district court's intention to impose the departure under the plea agreement, the basis of which was placed on the record. The appellate court ruled that even though the district court's reason for imposing the departure, the plea agreement, was inadequate and improper, there was sufficient evidence in the record to justify an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines. Defendant was being sentenced for third-degree criminal sexual conduct, and there was evidence in the record of a prior felony conviction for criminal sexual conduct. The record contained evidence of defendant's 1982 felony criminal-sexual-conduct conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, convicted defendant of first-degree driving while intoxicated (DWI). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that a prior implied-consent license revocation should not have been used to enhance the current offense to a felony because the district court in the prior case found that defendant's constitutional rights had been violated. He also argued that he failed to contest the revocation as he did not have the money to hire an attorney or pay the filing fee. The appellate court found that defendant's prior license revocation at issue occurred after defendant registered a blood-alcohol concentration of .10 or more following an arrest for DWI. Therefore, Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.03, subd. 22 (2002) permitted defendant's prior license revocation to be used to enhance his current DWI charge. Furthermore, defendant's inability to obtain counsel and pay the filing fee did not violate his constitutional rights as no U.S. Const. amend. VI right to counsel attached to the implied-consent proceedings.  Because the record did not indicate that defendant's license revocation was unconstitutional, defendant failed to meet his burden of properly challenging the constitutional validity of the revocation. As such, the license revocation was properly used to enhance his sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an owner and operator of a manufactured home community, challenged the judgment of the Dakota County District Court, Minnesota, awarding respondent, a non-profit organization, $ 31,232 in attorney fees pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 8.31, subd. 3a (2004), in the organization's suit alleging a violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 327C.13 (2002). The organization challenged the amount of the attorney-fee award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner prohibited peddling or soliciting anywhere within the community. The organization sought to inform manufactured home park residents about their legal rights and protections, and filed suit alleging that the owner's rule violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 327C.13. The district court enjoined the owner from preventing or interfering with the organization's peaceful leafleting, canvassing, and/or organizing residents from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and from 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. from May through August. Of the $ 45,248 that the organization claimed, the district court found that the organization was entitled to attorney fees, costs and disbursements totaling $ 31,232. The appellate court ruled that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the organization the prevailing party at trial because the district court's verdict was rendered in the organization's favor. Also, the district court did not clearly err by reducing the organization's award by $ 1,400 and by awarding it two-thirds of its requested fees. The district court found that the organization had not entirely reached its desired outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court failed to obtain a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel, the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knowingly violated the registration statute, and the predatory-offender registration statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166 (2002), was unconstitutional. In light of the trial court's advice and defendant's continued resistance to obtaining counsel, the appellate court concluded that defendant's decision to proceed pro se was knowing and intelligent. Further, evidence that a corrections officer told defendant several times while he was in prison that he had to register as a sex offender, that the bureau of criminal apprehension informed him of the registration requirement four times by letter after he was released, and that a deputy who later interviewed defendant also told him that he had to register was sufficient to support his convictions. Because defendant waived his right to a judicial trial and because sex-offender registration was not punishment, the appellate court concluded that the predatory-offender registration statute was not a bill of attainder, contrary to defendant's assertion.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2 (2004). Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it criminally penalized him for exercising his constitutional right to withhold consent to a search, in the form of a breath test, when law enforcement had no warrant to take the test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence. He refused consent for a breath test and was charged with second-degree refusal to submit to testing, in violation of &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2, and third-degree driving while impaired, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.26, subd. 1 (2004). The court stated that &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2, did not violate a defendant's right against self-incrimination, right to privacy, or Fourth Amendment rights. The legislature had a compelling state interest in protecting state residents from drunk drivers, and an important part of the implementation of that interest was the testing of those whom officers had probable cause to believe had been drinking and were driving while impaired. The statutory framework of implied consent set forth in &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2, was a reasonable means to accomplish the legislature's objective. Consequently, the statute was constitutional, and the lack of defendant's verbal consent to the taking of the breath test did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and the mother divorced in 1963. The stipulated judgment provided that the father would maintain a life insurance policy in favor of the son until he reached 18 and the father could not disinherit the child. The son filed an action for declaratory judgment interpreting and enforcing the paragraphs in the judgment that appeared to prohibit the father from disinheriting the son. The father sought a declaratory judgment construing the stipulation and judgment. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court held that the stipulated judgment prohibited the father perpetually from disinheriting the son. The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that when the various provisions regarding the provision on disinheritance were considered the judgment served to protect the mother's ability to provide for the son during his childhood and resulted from the father's obligations to the son as a &quot;minor child.&quot; The appellate court concluded that the prohibition against disinheriting the son in the judgment was not perpetual and ended when the son reached the age of majority.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the postconviction court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the petitioner's plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily given. It was not clearly erroneous for the postconviction court to find that the career offender provision of the plea agreement was ancillary to its primary purpose of obtaining a 13-month downward departure. Also, the petitioner argued that the $ 15,000 fine was unreasonable and violated the Excessive Fines Clauses of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. The appellate court ruled that the district court did not impose an unconstitutionally excessive fine. The fine imposed was within the range for a similar federal offense, and a survey of other state law indicated that the petitioner's fine was not grossly disproportionate to other states' penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by the police for speeding. Because defendant did not have a valid Minnesota driver's license, the officer had his car towed, cited defendant for driving without a license, and gave him a warning for speeding. Defendant was searched for weapons. Defendant consented to a search of his wallet that revealed $ 900. When asked if he wanted anything from his car before it was towed, defendant said he wanted to retrieve a bag of child's clothing. The officer went to get the clothing, but defendant testified he told the officer to forget about it. The officer found the bag and looked inside for weapons and stated that &quot;sitting right on top of the bag was a white powdery substance,&quot; that appeared to be methamphetamine. When defendant admitted the bag was his, defendant was arrested. The denial of defendant's motion to suppress was affirmed under the inevitable discovery doctrine because the impoundment of the car was proper and the bag and drugs would have been discovered once the vehicle was searched after being impounded.

Following a hearing, the district court denied defendant's motion to suppress. The appellate court ruled that the district court did not err in admitting evidence recovered pursuant to the investigatory stop, when the totality of the circumstances supported the investigatory stop. The officer received a dispatch report detailing a domestic dispute in progress. The officer observed a van that was similar, but not identical, in color to the suspect's vehicle coming from the general direction of the dispute. The officer had a sufficient reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop defendant's van and investigate the domestic dispute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Lyon County District Court (Minnesota), which denied his petition for postconviction relief from his sentence for second-degree criminal sexual conduct in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.343 (2002). The district court imposed a 102-month sentence, a double durational departure from the presumptive 51-month sentence for his crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court based the departure on three factors: (1) appellant had prior convictions; (2) appellant qualified as a patterned sex offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.108, subd. 1 (2002); and (3) appellant qualified as a dangerous offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2 (2002). On appeal, the court noted that appellant's prior convictions were one element of the presumptive sentence, which was based on the severity of the offense and appellant's criminal history score, including prior convictions. It determined that because the guidelines already incorporated appellant's prior convictions, they could not be used as the sole reason to depart. An enhanced sentence imposed under &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2(2) (i-ii), required a finding that the offender was a danger to public safety, based on a high-frequency rate of criminal activity or long involvement in criminal activity or an aggravating factor that would justify a durational departure under the sentencing guidelines. That involved a determination of facts beyond the elements of the offense. As such, appellant had a Sixth Amendment right to have a jury decide those facts beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parents' divorce, the mother moved for the appointment of a parenting-time expeditor under &sect; 518.1751, and the court appointed a parenting consultant. Because of disputes with the consultant, the mother sought the consultant's removal. The appellate court held that as the trial court appointed a parenting consultant as opposed to the &quot;parenting-time expeditor,&quot; the court was not required to address the constitutionality of &sect; 518.1751. The appellate court did reverse the trial court's denial of the motion to remove the consultant because it was unclear from the record as to whether both the mother and the father had agreed to the appointment of the consultant. Also, the court's order did not indicate under what circumstances the consultant could be removed. Thus, the matter was remanded to determine of the consultant was properly appointed, and determine the grounds for removal. The appellate court affirmed the request that the judge recuse himself as the mother did not show prejudice under Minn. R. Civ. P. 63.03.

The duration of his sentence was an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines and was based on the district court's finding under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 4 (2002), that he was a career offender. Appellant had a prior criminal-history score of six or more felonies and his current offense was part of a pattern of criminal conduct. In a postconviction proceeding, appellant contended that he was entitled to the retroactive application of the Blakely rule. The accused had a right to jury trial as to the determination that he engaged in a pattern of criminal conduct. However, Blakely was not subject to retroactive application. Therefore, appellant was not entitled to postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted in the Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, for first-degree criminal sexual conduct and sentenced to 144 months in prison with a 5-year conditional release provision. His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. He then petitioned for postconviction relief, requesting that the conditional-release provision be struck from his sentence; however, the petition was denied without a hearing. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged the denial of his petition for postconviction relief in which he argued that addition of a conditional-release term violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury determination of factors affecting the length of his sentence. The appellate court initially noted that because petitioner could have asserted a Blakely challenge to his sentence while his case was pending on direct appeal, but failed to do so, he was barred by Knaffla from raising the issue in a petition for postconviction relief. The appellate court held that conditional release, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.109, subd. 7, did not depend on any findings of fact beyond the jury verdict; therefore, Blakely did not impact the validity of Jones, and the trial court correctly concluded that petitioner's argument, based on Blakely, was without merit. The appellate court further held that the Minnesota Supreme Court had previously rejected a claim that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.109, subd. 7, unconstitutionally allowed the executive branch to control conditional release revocation, by usurping and interfering with judicial functions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Alleging a denial of due process, defendant appealed the trial court's ruling that his third prior impaired-driving incident, an implied-consent license revocation, could be used to enhance the degree of his current violation, which occurred before judicial review of the license revocation. The appellate court noted that under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.24, subd. 1(1) (2002), a person who drove while impaired was guilty of first-degree impaired driving if the person committed the violation within 10 years of the first of 3 or more qualified prior impaired driving incidents. The appellate court held that defendant, in fact, availed himself of the opportunity for judicial review under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.53, subds. 1, 2 (2002) within days of his implied-consent license revocation and that the trial court, following review, affirmed the revocation of his license. The appellate court concluded that because judicial review was completed well in advance of the State's use of the revocation to establish probable cause for first-degree driving while impaired, it discerned no impingement of defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer argued that the condition prohibiting a dock at the proposed lakeshore development was arbitrary and capricious because the county failed to adequately explain its basis, exceeded the county's authority to regulate land use, and was an unconstitutional exaction. The appellate court found that the Board expressly stated that its decision was based on letters from the Department of Natural Resources and Douglas County Soil and Water Conservation District. Absent any indication that the Board manufactured a justification for its decision after-the-fact, a one-week delay was not a basis for reversing the no-dockage condition. The letters were sufficiently scientific and based on concrete personal observations. The Douglas County, Minn., Zoning Ordinance &sect; IV.D.2.b(4)(c) clearly allowed for prohibition of docks in unsuitable areas upon consideration of relevant factors. The action taken by the Board did not require the developer to transfer any rights to the county. It did not prevent all reasonable use of the property. The developer continued to have alternative methods to access the lake.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate appealed the denial by the Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, of his motion for postconviction relief. Specifically, the inmate alleged that the postconviction court erred in ruling that his challenge to the extended jurisdiction juvenile (EJJ) sentencing for second-degree murder conviction was procedurally barred under Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.11, subd. 3(b) (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate pled guilty to a second-degree murder. The court imposed a stayed 360-month sentence, representing an upward durational departure from the presumptive 306-month sentence, with the stated aggravating factor that a robbery occurred during the commission of the crime. The inmate violated probation and waived his right to adult certification and a probation-revocation hearing. The district court revoked his EJJ status and maintained the 360-month stayed adult sentence, with adult probation. The appellate court agreed with the inmate that the trial court erred in finding that &sect; 244.11, subd. 3(b) applied to bar the inmate's petition for postconviction relief from his sentence because as the initial disposition of the inmate's sentence under EJJ was required to be a stay of execution, the district court did not depart dispositionally at the time sentence was imposed. The appellate court affirmed the denial of the inmate's petition however, as Blakely v. Washington did not apply to his case, and the district court did not err in departing from the presumptive sentence on the basis of the inmate's plea under Givens, the law applicable at the time of his conviction.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, he filed a petition for postconviction relief alleging vindictive prosecution and ineffective assistance of counsel, which was denied. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After absconding following his release from imprisonment on a criminal sexual conduct conviction, appellant drove a vehicle while intoxicated and was involved in an accident that killed the vehicle's passenger. The State obtained a criminal vehicular homicide conviction against appellant, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. The State then recharged appellant and garnered a conviction for escape. Appellant argued that his conviction warranted vacation as the product of vindictive prosecution. The appellate court noted that a defendant could establish prosecutorial vindictiveness through objective evidence that the prosecutor's decision to seek the additional charges was intended to be retaliatory. However, the appellate court held that no presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness arose if an additional charge did not arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts as the original charge. The appellate court concluded that because the context of adding an unrelated charge arising from a separate behavioral incident following a successful appeal did not suggest a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness, appellant was not entitled to a presumption of vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had four prior convictions for felony sex offenses. Upon his conviction for a fifth felony sex offense, the Waseca County District Court, Minnesota, imposed a sentence of life imprisonment under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.109, subd. 3(a)(3)(iii) (2004). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1985, the legislature repealed the intrafamilial sexual abuse statutes, including Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.3641 under which defendant was convicted in 1983. The crimes for which defendant was convicted in 1983 were merged with the criminal sexual conduct statutes, recodified as Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.341-.345 (1986). To be determined to be an ex post facto law, a statute had to apply to events that occurred before its enactment and had to disadvantage the offender affected by the new law. But there was no ex post facto violation if the change effected by the new statute was merely procedural and did not change the elements of an offense, increase the punishment, or change the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt. In 1998, the legislature repealed the former mandatory life-imprisonment law, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.346 (1996), which had been in effect since 1975, and recodified it as Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.109. This recodified law was in effect when defendant was convicted of criminal sexual conduct in 2005. The punishment for his 2005 conviction was enhanced by his qualifying previous convictions, which did not violate the ex post facto prohibition of either the federal or state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the court erred when it ruled that the information given by three concerned citizens, along with police corroboration of some details and information from a concerned citizen, did not provide sufficient probable cause to issue the warrant.

The concerned citizen gave a detailed description of the named methamphetamine cook and &quot;buy&quot; information, including a detailed description of the property and adjacent buildings where the methamphetamine production was to have taken place. The information was later corroborated by a second concerned citizen. The information was corroborated by a third citizen in June 2004 who gave very detailed information about the cooking operation and named defendant as a resident. The appellate court reversed the grant of the motion to suppress as there was fresh information within 30 days of the application of the warrant, one of the citizens had bought drugs from defendant, one or more citizens gave specific information about the details of the operation, and the information was corroborated by a police investigator.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The vehicle was stopped for a nonfunctioning headlight, which was a violation of traffic laws. The officer initially asked for the driver's license, which was a justifiable inquiry for a traffic violation. However, the driver who was shaky and nervous, lacked identification, and began immediately reaching around the vehicle and underneath the seats, and refused to stop after repeated requests. Because the vehicle was cluttered and disorganized, the officer was unable to see what the driver was reaching for as he rummaged through the vehicle. Based on his training and experience, the officer suspected that the driver was attempting to either locate a weapon, or hide weapons or contraband. The driver told the officer that he had possessed a &quot;marijuana roach,&quot; and that caused the officer to question the driver regarding consumption of controlled substances. Therefore, the officer had reasonable suspicion to expand the traffic stop.</SPAN></P>

Each man pointed a gun in her direction and the man closer to her took her purse. Defendant stated to the police that he drove the getaway car fast at the robbers' insistence. The prosecutor also pointed out that defendant had admitted that he had a fake gun in the car to protect himself, and the evidence showed that defendant's gun was on top of the center console in the truck, yet he did not use the gun to ward off the alleged carjackers. The prosecutor noted an inconsistency between defendant's version that he had been carjacked and the testimony that he did not tell the officer who arrested him or transported him to the station that two men had just pointed a gun at him and forced him to drive. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his motion to suppress was denied, defendant was convicted of a controlled substance offense in the Mille Lacs County District Court, Minnesota. He appealed, asserting that the officers who stopped his car for a traffic violation and arrested his passenger on an outstanding warrant lacked authority to search his car incident to his passenger's arrest, unreasonably detained him, and lacked articulable suspicion to conduct a pat-down search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A first officer recovered drug paraphernalia from the passenger's purse. Defendant appeared nervous and kept one arm pressed against his body. Suspecting that he was concealing a weapon, a second officer began a pat search of his outer clothing. Defendant was then asked to step out and to empty his pockets. Then, when asked to raise his arms, he tried to flee. One officer observed him throw a camera bag which contained methamphetamine. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that the officers exceeded the permissible scope of the traffic stop. In that respect, he was not detained for officers to conduct a generalized search for evidence of his criminal activity but, rather, for officers to search the area within the immediate control of the arrestee. Secondly, given his possible attempt to conceal an object under his arm, the second officer was entitled to frisk defendant. The request that he empty his pockets was an illegal search. While the evidence recovered from the camera bag was tainted by the latter illegal search, because defendant merely fled without resistance, the evidence was admissible under the doctrine of inevitable discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress, and his conviction, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed an expedited appeal of an order from the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which denied his motion for relief from judgment under Minn. R. Civ. P. 60.02(f), which the district court treated as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Appellant challenged his indeterminate commitment as a psychopathic personality on a number of grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court first noted that the district court properly treated appellant's motion as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court agreed with the district court that most of appellant's claims had been raised in two previous habeas challenges and were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The court rejected appellant's contention that in a prior habeas challenge, the incorrect standard of proof of clear-and-convincing evidence, rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, was used. The court agreed with the district court, which had ruled that the same argument had been raised and denied. A habeas petitioner was not entitled to elaborate on arguments already made by raising issues in a different way. In addition, to the extent it was not raised previously, the court disagreed with appellant on the merits of his burden-of-proof argument. Finally, the fact that appellant did not raise the issue of a due process violation in an earlier appeal did not relieve him from the preclusive effect of that decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The officers articulated multiple bases for suspecting criminal activity that permitted the expansion of the scope of the stop to a consent search. The officers did not simply ask to search the vehicle after a routine traffic violation and witnessing nervousness on the part of the suspects. One officer testified that he saw a pearl-handled object, which he thought was a weapon, neither the driver nor the passenger produced a driver's license or identification, neither knew the other by name, and neither had proof of insurance. The officer discovered that there were two outstanding warrants for defendant's arrest. In short, the officers articulated sufficient reasons to suspect criminal activity. Therefore, the district court did not err in concluding that the search was a lawful consent search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The presumptive sentences for the petitioner's offenses were 51 and 60 months confinement, and the statutory maximum sentence was 25 years in confinement. The petitioner was sentenced to two consecutive 40-year prison terms. The petitioner was later resentenced to two consecutive 25-year prison terms. The petitioner argued that the upward departure to the statutory maximum based on the patterned-sex-offender statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.108 (1998), violated his right to a jury trial under the U.S. Supreme Court Blakely decision. The petitioner argued that the resentencing resulted in two entirely new sentences. The petitioner argued that he was &quot;sentenced anew&quot; and therefore, his case was not final and Blakely applied. The appellate court ruled that the petitioner was not being resentenced under a new criminal statute, his sentence was simply adjusted so that it adhered to correct law. The Minnesota Supreme Court stated the petitioner's sentence was imposed in violation of the U.S. Supreme Court Apprendi decision and must therefore be reduced. The petitioner was having the same statutory sentence reduced. Also, the petitioner's case was final before Blakely was decided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants sought review of the decision of the Anoka County District Court (Minnesota), which convicted them of creating a public nuisance in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.74(1) (2004), and of violating Anoka, Minn., City Code &sect; 36-81.1(jj) (1997) (ordinance).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants stated that they placed their anti-abortion signs above rush hour traffic in order to draw attention to their message. They were subsequently convicted of creating a public nuisance and of violating the ordinance. On appeal the court affirmed, stating that the evidence sufficiently supported that defendants placed the signs above rush hour traffic with the intent to distract the drivers from the act of driving and to redirect their attention to the signs, which endangered the safety of a large number of the public. Therefore, defendants' acts constituted a violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.74(1) (2004). Because defendants could have had no reasonable doubt that their actions in distracting drivers from their task of driving endangered the drivers' and others' safety, defendants' argument that the statute was unconstitutionally vague failed. The trial court correctly concluded that defendants violated the ordinance because their signs did not fall within the exempted types of signs or banner exception contained in the ordinance. The court concluded that the ordinance did not violate defendants' First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 171.19 (2004), which had been canceled by respondent, the Minnesota Commissioner of Public Safety, upon the determination that there was sufficient cause to believe that appellant had consumed alcohol in violation of the total abstinence restriction on his driver's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had several alcohol-related incidents, resulting in the revocation of his driving privileges. His driving privileges were reinstated with the restriction that he totally abstain from alcohol and controlled substances. He was later arrested for driving while impaired (DWI). He submitted to a Breathalyzer test, with a final reported value of 0.10 alcohol concentration. His driving privileges were canceled as inimical to public safety. Meanwhile, it was determined that the investigatory stop of appellant was illegal. The trial court denied appellant's petition for review of the cancellation of his license under &sect; 171.19. On appeal, the court found that reinstating appellant's license was contrary to the public interest of keeping intoxicated drivers off the road rather than deterring unlawful police conduct. Further, the issue of whether the Commissioner had good cause to believe that appellant violated the total abstinence restriction on his driver's license was not litigated in the prior DWI and implied consent revocation proceeding. Because appellant violated the abstinence condition of his driving privileges, the Commissioner had good cause to cancel his license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Beginning in the 1950s, the public used a strip of land approximately 25 feet wide along the west edge of Lot 1, Block 4, as a dirt road to travel from State Highway # 6, now known as the Frontage Road, to First Street. Public use of the road continued until 2002. In 1995, the landowners bought certain commercial property, and the parking lot for that property provided access to First Street. The landowners asked the town to close First Street as it was impacting a mound septic system that served the land. The town refused. The landowners then obtained a boundary survey and received a permit from the county to build a fence along the westerly and northwesterly boundaries of their property. The landowners built the fence and later a building, but they obstructed the strip of land that had been used as the dirt road. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's determination under Minn. Stat. &sect; 160.05, subd. 1 that the dirt road had been dedicated to the public as the evidence showed that the road had been maintained by the town in the same quality and character as other already existing roads in the town and used by the public continuously for six years.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err by concluding that reasonable efforts failed to correct the conditions leading to the child's placement pursuant to &sect; 260C.301, subd. 1(b)(5) because the mother failed to comply with the trial court's orders. Because clear and convincing evidence supported terminating the mother's parental rights under &sect; 260C.301, subd. 1(b)(4), (5), (8), and because the evidence appeared to support the trial court's conclusion that termination was in the child's best interests, the district court did not clearly err in terminating the mother's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1996, defendant pled guilty in the Anoka County District Court, Mississippi, to aiding and abetting first-degree criminal sexual conduct in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.342, subd. 1(c), .05 (1996). The trial court sentenced him to 206 months in prison, a double durational departure from the presumptive guidelines sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the upward durational departure, based on aggravating factors found by the trial court, violated his right to a jury trial under Blakely v.

The appellate court noted that extending the benefit of the Blakely rule, holding that the relevant statutory maximum was not the maximum sentence a judge could impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum a judge might impose without any additional findings, beyond those cases pending on direct review at the time of the announcement of the rule would have undermined the retroactivity policy of validating good-faith state court decisions and preserving finality. The appellate court held that because defendant's sentence was final nearly eight years before the decision in Blakely, and because Blakely did not apply retroactively, he was not entitled to postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for violation of a harassment restraining order in the Wright County District Court, Minnesota. He appealed, asserting that the two-year harassment restraining order failed to clearly define the behavior it prohibited, and, therefore, it was unconstitutional to punish him for the asserted violation. He also asserted he could not be prosecuted for violating the restraining order because the order was vague and ambiguous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed that the alleged victim was a tenant who lived in a home on a 70-acre farm, which was originally owned by defendant's father. Defendant had allegedly made &quot;unwanted advances&quot; towards the victim when she first rented the home. Later, defendant acquired both the house and the farm from his father, but the restraining order was still in effect. In pertinent part, the restraining order simply stated that defendant &quot;was to stay away from where the victim resided.&quot; It also gave the applicable address. In the instant action, the victim claimed defendant showed up on a tractor, circled the house, and made unwanted &quot;eye contact.&quot; Defendant denied same and asserted he had a right to access the out buildings or implement buildings and the adjacent fields. The appellate court noted defendant had a right to access the surrounding acreage. Thus, as to the 70-acre farm, the restraining order was vague, and without more proof than was offered at trial, it was unenforceable. Moreover, the State used totally inappropriate and inadmissible evidence when eliciting testimony from the victim, where she outlined what the judge who issued the restraining order supposedly said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to the charges of first-degree aggravated robbery, second-degree criminal sexual conduct, and second-degree assault, which involved two victims, a male and a pregnant female. The district court imposed the departure based on its determination that the female victim was particularly vulnerable, being eight months pregnant at the time of the offense and the victim's vulnerability was known by defendant at the time of the offense. The appellate court ruled that the fact that the female victim was pregnant was insufficient by itself to support a finding of particular vulnerability, and the appellate court could not conclude that the violation under the U.S. Supreme Court Blakely decision was harmless error. The district court did not simply base the departure on the fact that the female victim was pregnant. Rather, the district court determined that the female victim was particularly vulnerable because she was pregnant. When threatened with a gun, a pregnant victim was not significantly more vulnerable than a victim who was not pregnant because a gun could kill either quite easily.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a former teacher, sued defendant, a school district, claiming that a teacher had a right to be free of harassment in the school environment under Minn. Stat. &sect; 121A.03 and the district's own policies. He also claimed the school failed to take any disciplinary action against school children who harassed him. The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, granted summary judgment for the school district. The former teacher appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former teacher first argued that the school district tort immunity statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.12, subd. 3a (2002), was unconstitutional. However, he failed to raise that issue in the district court, and he failed to notify the attorney general. Thus, said argument was not subject to review. Secondly, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.12 (2002), school districts were required to obtain liability insurance but were granted immunity from tort liability if they were unable to do so. The former teacher produced no evidence regarding insurance cost or availability or the district's lack of good faith. The school district, in contrast, provided evidence that the Minnesota Department of Commerce had informed it that same could not be obtained. Thus, there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the school district's compliance with the statutes. Third, because Minn. Stat. &sect; 121A.03 (2002) did not create a fixed standard of conduct regarding harassment of teachers, the former teacher could not rely on it to establish negligence per se. Finally, the district court did not err in its conclusion that the school district bore its burden to show it was protected by discretionary immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Stearns County District Court, Minnesota, for the offense of second-degree assault. The trial court imposed a presumptive guideline sentence of 57 months in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction, arguing that the trial court erred by refusing to admit evidence he claimed would have bolstered his claim of self-defense and that the evidence was insufficient to rebut his claim of self-defense. He further contended that the trial court erred by imposing a mandatory copayment for public defender costs without finding that he had the ability to pay. The appellate court noted that because nothing was known about the declarants, the trustworthiness of the statements could not be established and the statements did not qualify as excited utterances, and that even if the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the evidence, defendant failed to establish prejudice and any error was harmless. The appellate court held that defendant stabbed an unarmed man who was running toward the homeless shelter, and defendant did not retreat when he had an opportunity to do so; therefore, the evidence did not raise doubts about his conviction. The appellate court concluded that the trial court did not make the required statutory findings about defendant's ability to pay for public defender services under Minn. R. Crim. P. 5.02, subd. 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment of conviction was affirmed; however, the imposition of the copayment for public-defender costs was reversed and remanded to the trial court for a determination of defendant's ability to pay part of the cost of the public defender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a developer, submitted a zoning application to respondent, a county board of adjustment (the board), to sell two lots within an existing tract. After requesting further information, the board ultimately denied said application, in part, because said lots would have not met minimum size requirements. The developer appealed, and the Wright County District Court, Minnesota, granted summary judgment for the board. The developer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the developer was entitled to a variance. The record showed that he developer failed to meet four of the five requirements under Wright County, Mn., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 502.3 (2003). Specifically, the board determined: (1) the variance would have conflicted with the county's comprehensive plan to protect the natural environment and make wise use of the county's resources without degradation because of unnecessary development and crowding on a parcel that had a steep grade and potential sewer problems; (2) one tract would have continued to have had value as lake access for another tract; (3) the developer presented no evidence of a unique hardship, and (4) the variance would have altered the character of the neighborhood to the detriment of the county's land-use plan. Further, if the developer failed to prove only one of the latter conditions, as in the case at bar, the board could not legally grant the variance. Thus, the board's decision to deny the variance was reasonable. The appellate court rejected the developer's argument that an unconstitutional taking occurred. Mere diminution in market value of the land at issue did not constitute a taking.</SPAN></P>

Upon appointing a public defender to represent defendant, the district court ordered defendant to contribute a co-payment of $ 200 toward the cost of the public defender's legal services. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police informant arranged for defendant to come to her home to sell the informant methamphetamine.  The police listened in on a conversation between the informant and defendant where the informant specified the amount that she wanted to buy. Defendant arrived at the informant's house with his girlfriend and the driver and told the driver to give the informant a package and get $ 710 in return. The substance in the package testified positive for methamphetamine. Defendant was arrested and had tape that matched the tape the drugs were wrapped in. Defendant claimed he sold the informant a ring wrapped in black tape. The appellate court held that sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction as (1) the police informant was not an accomplice such that her testimony did not need to be corroborated, (2) the driver's testimony was corroborated by the informant's testimony, and (3) the failure to give an accomplice instruction under Minn. Stat. &sect; 634.04 (2002) was plain error, but did not affect defendant's substantial rights as the informant's testimony was sufficient to support the conviction even without the driver's testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of second-degree burglary following a jury trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two children were adjudicated in need of assistance in February 2002 alleging educational neglect. The children were placed in foster care in September 2002 after it was determined that they were in need of protective services. The county had provided numerous services to the mother including children's mental-health case management; in-home family therapy; psychiatric services; individual counseling services; respite care; mentors; mental-health case management for the mother; financial services, parental-capacity evaluations; foster-care placement; group-home placement; and child protective services. Despite the assistance provided, the situation never improved to where the children could be returned to the mother. The appellate court affirmed the termination of the mother's parental rights because under Minn. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;260C.301, subd. 1(b)(5) (2004), a court could terminate parental rights if it found that, following the child's placement out of the home, the county's reasonable efforts, under the direction of the court, failed to correct the conditions leading to the child's placement.

The mother's complaint alleged that the school district violated due process when it removed her children from school for a six-day period, until she proved to the school district's satisfaction that she resided in the district. The department concluded that the school district violated the Act by not providing the children with free and appropriate public education, and that corrective action was appropriate. The department ordered the school district to update its policies to provide due process to any disabled student before the school district sought removal for nonresidency. The court ruled that the department did not exceed its authority by determining that the school district was required to provide the children with some process before removing them from school. The department merely ordered the school district to adopt uniform and fair procedures before removing a student who was receiving services under the Act.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that because the police deputy testified that the CRI had previously given reliable information to police on several occasions, the district court could presume that the CRI was reliable. The law did not require more than the bald statement of the CRI's past veracity. The State established the CRI's reliability by evidence corroborating the CRI's tip before stopping defendant and searching his car. Defendant and his vehicle matched the descriptions given by the CRI, and defendant appeared at the exact location where the CRI said he would be at the time the CRI said he would be there. The CRI contacted defendant only a few hours before the arrest, and that, coupled with the statement that defendant &quot;routinely&quot; carried drugs in his steering wheel, provided information that was not stale.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the joint airport zoning board adopted an ordinance approved by respondent state commissioner of transportation, appellant business operators filed suit seeking, inter alia, a writ of mandamus compelling the commissioner to comply with the applicable statutes and regulations. The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, granted the commissioner's motion to dismiss. The operators appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the operators challenged the trial court's conclusions that the commissioner's decision was quasi-judicial in nature, thereby depriving the trial court of jurisdiction to hear the matter, and that the action was premature. The appellate court found that the commissioner's order was quasi-judicial as it reflected the department of transportation's extensive investigation and scrutiny of the proposed regulations, outlined the agency's extensive examination, identified the statutory standard to be applied, and was binding. Thus, a writ for certiorari was the appropriate means for the operators' to challenge the order, and the trial court was correct in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus. Further, dismissal of the operators' claim that the rulemaking was improper and void was proper as the trial court did not have jurisdiction over a challenge to the validity of a rule. Finally, because the commissioner's order had not resulted in a direct and imminent injury to the operators, there was no justiciable controversy, and the trial court thus lacked jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment concerning the constitutionality of the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of theft by swindle in the Mille Lacs County District Court, Minnesota. After the jury's determination of guilt, as to the sentencing proceeding, the trial court instructed the jury in regard to a particular-vulnerability aggravating factor. No new evidence was presented, and the jury returned its decision, finding the elderly victims were vulnerable adults. The district court imposed a departure. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the sentencing-jury proceeding initiated by the trial court was extra-legal in that, although a jury sentencing determination may have been mandated as a matter of constitutional principle by Blakely v. Washington, it was not authorized in practice by any rule or statute. He also argued that he was denied due process because the offense for which he was sentenced, which included the victim-vulnerability aggravating factor, was not charged in the complaint. In part, the appellate court held the sentencing procedure, which amounted to a minor extension of the special-interrogatory procedure recognized by the Minnesota Supreme Court, was neither novel nor unprecedented. There was no rule or statute prohibiting the procedure, and the United States Supreme Court's holding in Blakely provided ample justification for the trial court to employ it. In sum, the district court's submission of the determination of the aggravating factor to the jury fully vindicated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial as recognized in Blakely. Secondly, defendant did not have a due process right to have potential sentencing provisions cited in the complaint or indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions and sentences, and the court affirmed the convictions, concluding that he was not deprived of his right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. Additionally, the evidence was sufficient, the jury instructions did not constitute plain error, and defendant's pro se arguments lacked legal merit. In regard to his deprivation of counsel argument, the court also stated that the record did not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the denial of his motion for a continuance to seek substitute counsel. He also failed to demonstrate the ability to secure private counsel. His sentences were improper, however, because they violated Blakely. The district court based the upward departure of 21 months on its finding of three specific aggravating factors. Those factors were neither admitted by defendant nor found by the jury. His sentence was also inappropriate under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11, subd. 5(a) (2002) because the question of whether he committed the kidnapping and assault offense while in possession of a firearm was not implicit in the jury's guilty verdicts and needed to be remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The petitioner and respondent State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner pled guilty to fifth-degree controlled-substance crime, and to possession of a short-barrel shotgun. The petitioner was sentenced to one year and one day, stayed, on the gun-possession charge and to the mandatory 36-month minimum for the controlled-substance crime because the petitioner possessed a firearm during the commission of the drug offense. The State argued that the district court erred by applying the U.S. Supreme Blakely decision retroactively to the petitioner's sentence. The petitioner challenged the district court's order convening a sentencing jury. The appellate court ruled that the district court erred by applying Blakely retroactively to the petitioner's 36-month sentence, and abused its discretion by vacating the petitioner's sentence. The petitioner's convictions and sentences were final before Blakely, and was not entitled to benefit from the rule announced in that case. The petitioner pled guilty in April 2003, and he was sentenced on June 2, 2003. The petitioner did not directly appeal his convictions or sentences. The petitioner's convictions and sentences became final on August 31, 2003, almost one year before Blakely was decided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Olmsted County District Court (Minnesota), which convicted him of aiding and abetting a controlled-substance crime involving the manufacture of methamphetamine. Defendant argued, in part, that the warrantless search of the motel room in which the police discovered the methamphetamine was unconstitutional and that the district court erred by denying his request for a downward dispositional departure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant waived an omnibus hearing. The court first determined that because by waiving the hearing defendant deprived the State of the opportunity to establish an adequate factual record for the search, the search issue could not be decided on the record. The court noted that even if defendant had not waived the search issue, he was precluded from challenging the constitutionality of the search because he lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy in the motel room where the drugs were found. The court found that the district court correctly calculated defendant's mandatory minimum sentence. When he committed the instant crime, he had pled guilty to but had not been sentenced for a previous offense. Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.02, subd. 5, a person was convicted of a crime when the district court accepted and recorded a plea of guilty. The court also found that defendant did not meet his burden of proving that he satisfied the criteria for a downward dispositional departure. The court lastly rejected defendant's argument that his attorney's unilateral decision to waive an omnibus hearing constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The decision was a legitimate tactical decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial was a bench trial and the district court sua sponte, considered said lesser-included offense of first degree sexual contact as opposed to sexual penetration. The appellate court noted that said decision was within the sound discretion of the district court. Further, where the victim had repeatedly given testimony that was detailed and consistent regarding what had been repeated assaults, notwithstanding extremely able cross-examination, the district court had a rational basis on which to convict him of the lesser-included offense of criminal sexual conduct in the first-degree-sexual contact, while acquitting him as to sexual penetration. Secondly, given the victim's credibility and the corroborating testimony of two Spriegl witnesses (other child victims), the evidence sufficed to support defendant's conviction. However, as to the sentencing departure, same violated the rule announced in Blakely, and of State v. Shattuck, as amended, because Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2 (2002) permitted the trial court, without the aid of a jury to determine, that defendant was a dangerous offender for purposed of imposing an aggravated durational sentencing departure.</SPAN></P>

Consistent with the plea agreement, the district court imposed a sentence of 98 months, which was an upward sentencing departure. The petitioner argued that his sentence violated his constitutional rights because the upward durational departure was based on aggravating factors found by the judge, not a jury. The district court denied the petition for postconviction relief on the grounds that the petitioner's conviction and sentence were final by the time the U.S. Supreme Court decided Blakely. The appellate court ruled that the petitioner's conviction and sentence were final at the time Blakely was decided, and Blakely did not apply to the petitioner's sentence. Blakely provided no legal basis upon which the petitioner could successfully challenge his sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Clay County District Court (Minnesota) of fourth-degree driving while under the influence (DWI). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was seized when a uniformed officer, who arrived in a squad car, approached him when he was sitting in his vehicle in his brother's driveway. The court of appeals disagreed. The officer's actions would not lead a reasonable person to believe that he was not free to leave. Defendant argued that the officer parked behind his vehicle, suggesting that his movement was blocked. But defendant cited the trial transcript in support of that argument, rather than the relevant evidentiary hearing transcript. Neither defendant nor the officer testified at the evidentiary hearing that the officer blocked defendant's movement by parking his squad car behind defendant's parked vehicle. Indeed, the officer was unaware of defendant's presence when he arrived at the location. Neither did the officer activate his squad car's lights or siren. Instead, the officer merely approached defendant, who was in his parked vehicle, to ask questions. Thus, the officer's actions did not constitute a Fourth Amendment seizure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In post-conviction proceedings, the Itasca County District Court, Minnesota, affirmed appellant inmate's conviction of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving force or coercion. He appealed. The State appealed appellant's criminal sentence, arguing that the district court abused its discretion by, in effect, applying Blakely retroactively to reduce his sentence to the presumptive term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over the course of two or three days, appellant had sexual contact with the victim against her will. An officer testified that the victim was in a lot of pain, and he saw bruises and cigarette burns on her. The evidence established that appellant inflicted pain and caused the victim to suffer personal injury while accomplishing sexual penetration. He was not entitled to relief from his conviction for first-degree criminal sexual conduct under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.342, subd. 1(e)(i) (2002). The prosecutor's disparaging remarks on appellant's character and lifestyle did not deny him a fair trial. The jury was instructed that counsel's arguments were not evidence. The fact that defense counsel represented the victim in a termination of parental rights case did not create a conflict of interest. Appellant was properly sentenced under the dangerous-offender statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2 (2004), to a 240-month prison term. The district court erred by concluding that appellant's sentence was illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's judgment upholding appellant's conviction was affirmed. The judgment finding that his sentence was unconstitutional was reversed, and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The petitioner was sentenced to a double upward durational departure of 124 months on the aggravated-robbery conviction. The petitioner filed for postconviction relief, challenging her sentence, arguing that the sentence was unconstitutional because a judge, not a jury, found the facts supporting the double upward durational departure. The appellate court ruled that the postconviction court did not abuse its discretion by denying the petitioner's postconviction petition for relief. Because the petitioner's conviction was final before the U.S. Supreme Court decided Blakely, she was not entitled to retroactive application of Blakely on collateral review. The petitioner's conviction became final on approximately June 30, 1999, when she failed to perfect a direct appeal. Thus, the petitioner did not have a direct appeal pending when the U.S. Supreme Court decided Apprendi in June 2000. Blakely did not apply retroactively to collateral attacks on convictions pending at the time Apprendi was decided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her convictions, but the court affirmed the conviction for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, stating that the evidence showed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy when defendant provided an undercover agent with directions, a map, and a picture so that he could kill her former boyfriend. Additionally, defendant and the agent had agreed that the agent would kill the boyfriend. The court did reverse the conviction for attempt to commit first-degree murder because defendant's acts were in preparation for and remote in time and place from the intended murder of the boyfriend. Thus, she did not commit a substantial step toward the commission of the crime and the evidence did not support defendant's conviction of attempt. Her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was not violated because she never actually took the stand, nor was she compelled to testify or to incriminate herself. The trial court did not violate the Sixth Amendment by sentencing her to the presumptive guidelines sentence authorized by the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the petitioner cited no authority supporting his position that the existence of contrary precedent made a constitutional claim novel.

The State contended that defendant was prohibited from challenging the enhancement because he could not collaterally attack the validity of a prior license revocation in a subsequent proceeding. The appellate court disagreed with the State as its argument contradicted controlling precedent. However, the appellate court also found that defendant did not challenge the constitutionality of his revocation in a proceeding under Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate criminal cases, defendants each requested postconviction relief challenging their upward durational departure sentences under the career-offender statute,&nbsp;Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendants argued that they were entitled to postconviction relief because their sentences were imposed in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. VI right to a jury trial announced in Blakely. They also challenged the trial court's denial of their motions to remove for cause the trial court judges who denied the petitions. The appellate court held that Blakely did not fall within the exceptions to the general rule of prospective application. Because the convictions and sentences were final before the new rule in Blakely was announced, defendants did not benefit from the new rule. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying their petitions for postconviction relief. Although the chief judge offered an analysis of the retroactivity issue in the interest of promoting uniformity, he acknowledged his lack of authority to bind the other members of the bench and invited each judge to render his or her legal opinion independent of the proffered analysis. The record was devoid of any evidence that the judges who ruled on the postconviction petitions at issue did not employ their own legal analysis in rendering their decisions. Accordingly, the removal motions were properly denied.</SPAN></P>

The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, found clear and convincing evidence that the patient met the statutory criteria for commitment as a sexually dangerous person, and he was committed to the Minnesota Sex Offender Program (MSOP). The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient did not challenge the district court's conclusion that he had manifested a sexual, personality, or other mental disorder or dysfunction, but he argued that the evidence did not meet the statutory criteria with respect to the course of harmful sexual conduct or his propensity to reoffend sexually. However, based on the expert testimony of a court-appointed examiner and the district court's own experience, it found that the State established by clear and convincing evidence that, as a result of the patient's past course of harmful sexual conduct and his personality disorder, it was &quot;highly likely&quot; that he would engage in future acts of harmful sexual conduct. In part, the examiner found that the patient minimized aspects of his offenses and typically refused to participate in treatment or was terminated from treatment programs in correctional facilities. She concluded he was an untreated sex offender who lacked a well-developed relapse-prevention plan for sex offenses. The patient had numerous past sexual offenses, and their remoteness did not negate the finding of future dangerousness. The appellate court held his commitment as an SDP was proper.</SPAN></P>

This sentence amounted to a 90-month upward durational departure from the 110-month presumptive sentence under the sentencing guidelines. The sentencing court determined that substantial and compelling reasons justified the upward departure. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of the inmate's petition for postconviction relief as the state supreme court had previously decided that Blakely v. Washington was not a &quot;watershed&quot; rule, which would require retroactivity. Thus, because Blakely was decided 10 years after the inmate had pleaded guilty, he was not entitled to postconviction review of his sentence in light of Blakely.</SPAN></P>

XIV, &sect; 1 or Minn. Const. art.

The mother's will appointed the stepfather as guardian of the four children, and he filed a guardianship petition pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 257C.03, subd. 1 (2004), which was granted. On appeal, the father claimed the trial court erred in awarding custody to the stepfather based on a policy of keeping siblings together and in denying his motion to dismiss for improper venue.

The record showed that the children did not have a relationship with their father and that after moving to his home, one child engaged in self-injurious behavior and threatened to run away.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On September 28, 1994, appellant was found guilty of nine counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.342 (1990). He was sentenced in March 1995 to 480 months, an upward durational departure from the sentencing guidelines based on the judge's findings that he was a patterned sex offender and that his crimes involved severe aggravating factors. Appellant's sentence was affirmed on direct appeal in March 1996. The appellate court affirmed the denial of the inmate's petition and held that because the inmate's petition for postconviction relief was a collateral attack on a conviction that was final before Apprendi or Blakely were decided, the inmate was not entitled to retroactive application of either rule, and the inmate's petition for postconviction relief was properly denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to possession of child pornography in the Kandiyohi County District Court, Minnesota. His subsequent motion to withdraw his plea was denied. He appealed, asserting, in part, that he should have been allowed to withdraw his plea because his attorney was ineffective, that the prosecutor failed to disclose exculpatory evidence, and that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that defendant's argument that his &quot;attorney did not knowingly and voluntarily waive defendant's rights,&quot; was without merit because only defendant could waive his rights, and this had to be done personally in writing or orally on the record. Secondly, the record reflected a knowing and voluntary waiver by defendant after extremely thorough questioning by his attorney, the prosecutor, and the district court. For example, the record established that defendant understood the nature of the charge, the plea agreement, the rights waived by a guilty plea, including the right to appeal pretrial rulings, and the potential sentence. In addition, it was clear from the record that defendant understood that his guilty plea would result in giving up the right to appeal pretrial matters. Thus, counsel was not ineffective and the district court properly denied defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The denial was also proper because defendant had repeatedly delayed the proceedings, the State was prejudiced by the age of the case, and because there was emotional strain on the State's witnesses from preparing for trial twice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court, denying defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the same day that appellant requested a recount of an election that she was in, she also filed in the district court a petition to contest the election, asserting that several violations of election laws occurred during the election. She mailed copies of the petition to respondent and to the city clerk, and she also personally served a copy on the clerk. Following the recount, appellant mailed a second copy of the petition to respondent by certified mail. The district court granted respondent's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and the court affirmed, stating that it was appellant's failure to comply with statutory requirements that resulted in service on respondent not being effected. Therefore, the strict procedural requirements set by the legislature in Minn. Stat. &sect; 209.021 (2004) had to be adhered to and thus, the district court properly concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over respondent. Further, appellant's argument that &sect; 209.021 was unconstitutionally vague was not presented to and considered by the district court. Thus, the court did not consider the argument on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Police called defendant and his two friends over to talk, but defendant acted evasively, and walked quickly away, avoiding any contact with the officers. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court held that the anonymous tip alone lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to justify an investigative stop, but that given the officer's relationship with defendant and defendant's evasive conduct, there was reasonable suspicion for an investigative stop. The court held that the officer's request for the group to &quot;come here&quot; was not a seizure and that seizure occurred when another officer grabbed defendant's jacket. The court also held that the officer's grabbing of defendant's jacket did not exceed the scope of the stop.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was convicted in the Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, for offering a forged check. The trial court departed from the sentencing guidelines and sentenced him to 120 months in prison. Respondent filed a postconviction petition, seeking to reduce his sentence, and the trial court found that his enhanced sentence based on a judicial finding of a pattern of criminal conduct was unconstitutional under Blakely. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following respondent's conviction and sentencing, he pursued a direct appeal, but the judgment was affirmed and he sought no further review other than his postconviction petition. The appellate court noted that the issue in the case was whether the rule announced in Blakely applied to respondent's conviction, which was final before Blakely was decided. The appellate court held that if an appellant's case was final when Blakely was decided, he did not receive the benefit of the Blakely decision, and that a case was final when a judgment of conviction had been rendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a petition for certiorari had elapsed or a petition for certiorari had been filed and finally denied. The appellate court further held that respondent's conviction was final on December 12, 2000, but that Blakely was decided on June 24, 2004; therefore, he was not entitled to application of the rule established in Blakely.</SPAN></P>

Defendant told the principal that his son said that he had been injured while playing basketball during gym class. The principal spoke with the gym teacher who said that no injuries had occurred during class the day before, and the son told the school nurse that defendant had hit him. The son also told a nurse at the hospital that defendant had hit him with a closed fist. Both nurses testified at trial that the son stated that defendant had hit him; defendant testified that the son told him he fell while playing basketball at school. The appellate court affirmed the admission of the nurse's testimony under Minn. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(C) because the son had the opportunity to see and know who he was identifying and because the district court further found that he had no reason to fabricate his statements to the nurses.

The city council had the power to provide for the government and good order of the city, the suppression of vice and immorality, the prevention of crime, the protection of public and private property, the benefit of residence, trade, and commerce, and the promotion of health, safety, order, convenience, and the general welfare. The ordinance did not violate the Minnesota Constitution's one subject limit, which was a constitutional limit on the legislature and did not apply to a municipal ordinance. As to defendant's argument that the ordinance was vague, defendant failed to show why the appellate court should find this ordinance unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to making terroristic threats against his estranged wife and to kidnapping her male friend. The trial court imposed the presumptive guidelines sentence of 27 months' imprisonment for the terroristic-threats offense and a concurrent sentence of 130 months' imprisonment for the kidnapping offense. The 130-month sentence was an upward durational departure from the presumptive guidelines sentence of 108 months. The sentence was upheld on direct appeal.  Appellant petitioned for postconviction relief, alleging that his sentence was unconstitutional under Blakely. The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, appellant contended that he did not seek retroactive application of Blakely. Rather, he claimed that he was entitled to prospective application of Apprendi in light of Blakely's interpretation of the Apprendi decision. The court found that appellant's conviction and sentence became final on November 18, 2002, which was the deadline for filing a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. Because his conviction and sentence were final when the Blakely rule was decided on June 24, 2004, appellant could not avail himself of the new rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant pleaded guilty to first and second degree criminal sexual conduct and disseminating pornographic work involving a minor, an upward departure from the 144-month presumptive sentence was imposed. After Blakely was decided, appellant sought postconviction relief. The Clay County District Court, Minnesota, denied appellant's petition, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant raised several issues challenging the denial of his motion for post-conviction relief. The appellate court held that the postconviction court did not err in denying appellant retroactive application of Blakely. As the evidence against appellant was overwhelming and his counsel had no control over the timing of the State's plea offer, appellant failed to establish that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the time allowed to accept the plea offer and failing to request an evidentiary hearing. Although appellant's offenses did involve the same victim, his convictions for first and second degree criminal sexual conduct resulted from different actions occurring at different times, and one required sexual contact while the other required sexual penetration. Therefore, appellant was not subjected to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1993, defendant city had issued plaintiff property owner a permit to build a fence in an attempt to resolve a trespass dispute. In 2000, the city issued a permit to the neighboring property owner to build a higher fence, albeit in a different location. The property owner challenged a city ordinance in the latter respect. The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, granted partial summary judgment for the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner asserted the fence obstructed his view of a lake (both properties were lakefront property). There was also an issue as to setback requirements. At issue was Shoreview, Minn., City Code &sect; 205.080(F)(1), which generally required a 50-foot setback requirement. The appellate court held the city's construction of the ordinance led to an absurd and unreasonable result because the ordinance referred to adjacent structures, not adjacent parcels. In the instant case, there were actually three homes that were adjacent to each other, including the home of the property owner. Because there was no apparent underlying policy goal that provided a basis for significantly different setbacks for fences built in almost exactly the same location along the same boundary line, the city's interpretation of the ordinance was absurd and unreasonable. However, the property owner did not have an equal protection claim because, given that the permits were issued seven years apart, the property owners were not similarly situated. Finally, the property owner did not have a due process claim because the city's conduct did not rise to the level of egregious conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Per a plea agreement, defendant pled guilty to first-degree assault in the Itasca County District Court, Minnesota. After several probation violations, the district court revoked same and imposed his original 172-month sentence. Defendant appealed, asserting the district court abused its discretion in revoking his probation based on three new misdemeanor offenses without making specific findings on the Austin factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Minnesota Supreme Court had recently determined that a district court was required to make each of the Austin findings expressly and on the record before a defendant's probation could be revoked. Since the district court failed to do so, the case had to be remanded for additional findings. Defendant also claimed that Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.11, subd. 3(b) (2002) (regarding a plea agreement and a stayed sentence with a departure) was unconstitutional, in part, because a defendant could not waive his right to appeal a sentence, and because the criminal rules took precedence. The appellate court held: (1) defendant's waiver of his right to appeal his sentence was unenforceable, but &sect; 244.11, subd. 3(b), which required an appeal within 90 days of pronouncement of sentence, did not violate the separation of powers doctrine; (2) Minn. R. Crim. P. 28.02 did not provide for an unconditional, unlimited right to appeal, and because Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.11, subd. 3(b) (2002) merely clarified that the same time limit applied to defendants who agreed to plea agreements, there was no conflict; and (3) defendant's upward durational departure was not unconstitutional pursuant to Blakely v. Washington.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that there was no constitutional infirmity in defendant's sentence, and that Blakely v. Washington did not apply. Further, the trial court did not err in finding particular cruelty. However, because the trial court failed to make all the requisite Austin findings, the appellate court reversed and remanded for additional findings.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The district court precluded the offer because it was made on the day of trial. Even had the court allowed defendant to show cause for the untimely motion, ultimately the evidence would not have been admissible. Defendant did not initiate the issue but rather requested permission to present the evidence of his sexual relationship with the victim in response to the State's motion to preclude such evidence. The sole evidence of the past sexual conduct was the victim's own statement to the police that she was with defendant once in 2001, was very drunk and could not remember what happened, but that she believed she had sex with him. That vague reference to what she might have done on a remote prior occasion when she was very drunk would not support a finding that it was true that she had sex with defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of second-degree felony murder. The trial court sentenced him to 240 months in prison, an upward durational departure. The trial court based its departure on the victim's particular vulnerability due to extreme intoxication, lack of consciousness, and incapacity to defend himself from the blows that resulted in his death. It also found that defendant's participation in the fatal beating was particularly cruel. On appeal, defendant argued that the upward departure was based on judicial findings and was therefore unconstitutional under Blakely. The court found that defendant never stipulated to the judicial findings of aggravating factors or waived his right to a jury determination of the facts. Under Blakely, the trial court's decision to impose an upward departure on the basis of the aggravating factors, rather than permit a jury to make the necessary factual determinations, amounted to a violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment right. Finally, the court denied the State's request to sever the provisions of the sentencing guidelines that required mandatory application and to make the guidelines advisory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's sentence and remanded the case for resentencing consistent with Blakely.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the appellate court held the evidence was sufficient to sustain his convictions. The appellate court also held that (1) while defendant's trial which began 98 days after his speedy-trial demand raised a presumption that a violation had occurred, he was not denied a speedy trial where prejudice was not shown and where same was due to the unavailability of his public defender, to the late submission of his alibi witnesses, and due to court scheduling conflicts; (2) Spreigl evidence of his two previous burglary convictions was properly admitted to prove identity because they also involved the taking of an automobile; and (3) as to his sentence, because the pattern-of-criminal-conduct finding was based on a judicially found facts and not on defendant's stipulation or a jury determination, the departure violated defendant's rights under the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer failed to file Minnesota individual income tax returns for the years 1996 through 2000 and the commissioner prepared returns on the taxpayer's behalf pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 289A.35 (2000), which provided that if a taxpayer failed to file a return for a taxable year the commissioner could prepare a return on the taxpayer's behalf. The court affirmed the taxpayer's appeal, stating that it was well-established law under both federal and Minnesota law that wages and compensation were taxable income. Further, federal courts universally upheld the constitutionality of tax assessment collection schemes such as those in Minnesota. The taxpayer's assertion that requiring him to file income tax return violated his rights against compulsory self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V was without merit. The privilege against compulsory self-incrimination was not a defense to prosecution for failing to file a return at all. The privilege could only be claimed against specific disclosures sought on a return.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer and appellee Commissioner of Revenue settled a tax case which had been in and out of courts for eight years. The settlement agreement stated that the issue of fees and costs was reserved and that the taxpayer did not waive any of his rights to request attorneys' fees and costs. The Minnesota Tax Court of Ramsey County subsequently dismissed the case without a final judgment in favor of either party. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the taxpayer requested fees and costs pursuant to either Minn. Stat. &sect; 270.19 or, in the alternative, under the Minnesota Equal Access to Justice Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 15.471-.474 (2002). In determining who was the prevailing party, the instant court looked to the settlement agreement order dismissing the action. The agreement was clear that the parties were simply walking away from a long and arduous case; no one recovered anything more than had already been paid, no one admitted to any liability, and the case was dismissed. No verdict was rendered nor judgment entered in favor or against either party. While both parties succeeded in some aspects of the litigation, neither party succeeded in the matter overall. As such, the instant court could not determine that the taxpayer was the prevailing party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's request for fees and costs was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue issued an order disallowing an exclusion from the amount he determined to represent non-Minnesota receipts. The order assessed additional tax liabilities against appellant health care facility. The health care facility challenged the order. The parties then stipulated to the facts and were seeking judgment from the tax court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The health care facility was a business provider who provided health care services, and whose receipts were subject to the MinnesotaCare tax, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 295.50-295.59. In its tax returns, the health care facility included at Line 1 (total amount received) the gross revenues received from all sources for its medical reference laboratory services. It excluded from those gross revenues at Line 7 (amount received from hospitals and other providers) the amounts received for its medical reference laboratory services from customers that were hospitals, surgical centers or health care providers located both within and outside of Minnesota. The health care facility argued that the Commerce Clause was violated by the Commissioner's order because the distinction drawn by the tax statute between Minnesota and non-Minnesota receipts failed to satisfy the internal consistency test and facially discriminated against interstate commerce. The tax court found no violation of the Commerce Clause; the statute did not contain a geographic-based distinction so as to amount to discrimination against interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>
