R. Civ. P. 41(b). HOLDINGS: [1]-The court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the delay was inexcusable because, following the remand of the case, the case was stagnant on the court docket for approximately three years and staffing issues and settlement negotiations did not provide a legitimate excuse for the delay. Furthermore, substantial evidence supported the court's determination that the corporation was prejudiced by the passage of time due to the death of an individual who was of central importance to the corporation's defense of the action; [2]-The chancery court did not abuse its discretion in determining that lesser sanctions were not sufficient.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-1 (2015), the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on the elements of grand larceny as they existed at the time the crime was committed; [2]-The trial court did not err in quashing the subpoena of codefendant, who was being tried separately, because, on the advice of counsel, codefendant indicated an intent to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege as to all questions defense counsel would have asked him; [3]-The trial court did not err in admitting Google Earth images of defendant's property, because the State made a prima facie showing that the photographs accurately depicted his property on the dates at issue.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43-47-1 to 43-47-39 (Rev. 2015), was not unconstitutionally vague, because, while the Legislature defined &quot;vulnerable person&quot; broadly, it defined the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people could understand what conduct was prohibited and in a manner that did not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement; [2]-The indictment satisfied Miss. Unif. Crim. R. Cir. Ct. Prac. 7.06, in that it fully notified defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation, as he the date ranges, the transactions, the banks, the account numbers, and the alleged victim of the crimes charged; [3]-The trial court did not err in excluding the victim's will and a letter, because evidence the victim left her estate to defendant would not have assisted the jury in determining if he took money before she died.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">ISSUE: Whether the statute of limitations had run on any claims that a client may have had as to his court appointed attorney's negligence or professional malpractice, when the client alleged that his attorney failed to investigate whether the client had served one year or more on the two sentences used to support the client's habitual-offender status and failed to raise this defense at the client's sentencing hearing. HOLDINGS: [1]-The client knew that his attorney had acted negligently when the client was sentenced as a habitual offender because the client admitted that, at the time of his sentencing, he informed his attorney that he had not served a full year on one of his convictions. As such, the client's suit was time-barred, under Miss. Code &sect; 15-1-49, because the three-year statute of limitations began to run from the date of his sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

R. Evid. 404, as the trial court allowed only limited statements regarding the prior incarceration and instructed both parties to present a limiting instruction for the jury; [4]-The facts amply supported the determination of the jury, which after weighing the aggravators and mitigators, decided that the penalty of death was not too great.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-Forfeiture provisions in wills in Mississippi were enforceable unless a will contest was founded upon probable cause and made in good faith; [2]-The forfeiture provision in the decedent's will was unenforceable against the complainant because her will contest was based upon probable cause and was brought in good faith. Thus, she was entitled to her inheritance as provided in the will; [3]-The trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the executor to remove estate assets to pay attorneys to represent the estate during the will contest. However, the chancellor erred in refusing to remove the executor under the will upon finding that the complainant's evidence in support of the executor's removal was not uncontested.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court committed reversible error by allowing the admission of DNA test results without providing defendant the opportunity to confront the DNA analyst who did the testing in violation of his confrontation rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The supreme court disagreed. The record illustrated that the witness, as the technical reviewer assigned to the case, was familiar with each step of the complex testing process conducted by the analyst, and the witness performed her own analysis of the data. The witness personally analyzed the data generated by each test conducted by the analyst and signed the report. Given the witness's knowledge about the underlying testing process and the report itself, any questions regarding the accuracy of the report due to possible contamination of the DNA samples could have been asked of the witness. Consistent with the holding in Grim, no Confrontation Clause violation occurred in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant in the Oktibbeha County Circuit Court (Mississippi) of capital murder with the underlying felony of robbery, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(2)(e) (2006). The jury determined that defendant was to suffer the death penalty. Accordingly, the circuit court sentenced defendant to suffer death by lethal injection until death was pronounced. The circuit court denied defendant's post-trial motions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stated in his confession that he killed the victim during a fight, left the apartment for approximately an hour and a half, and then returned and began a clean-up effort when he was discovered by a sheriff's deputy. During the clean-up effort, he removed the victim's wallet and other personal items. Other evidence showed that he used the victim's cash and credit card to purchase cleaning supplies with which to conceal the crime. On appeal, the court found that (1) the jury received proper instruction on the elements of capital murder and on the one-continuous-transaction rule; (2) the indictment for capital murder predicated on robbery was sufficient; (3) the State of Mississippi sufficiently narrowed defendant's conduct to a level of egregiousness sufficient to support imposition of the death penalty; (4) the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's capital-murder conviction; (5) the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's heat-of-passion manslaughter theory; and (6) the trial court did not manifestly err in finding from the totality of the circumstances that defendant's rights waiver was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.</SPAN></P>

It held that PCR counsel had been deficient. Because none of petitioner's present claims for relief were meritorious, however, petitioner had not suffered prejudice. He had failed to show that his claims met any exceptions to the procedural bars. Next, petitioner sought access to his experts for the purpose of evaluation, testing, and any other purpose reasonably believed by counsel to be necessary for the full litigation of his postconviction claims. The court stated that as a matter of due process, prisoners sentenced to death should be granted access to their experts so long as the access complied with the rules and regulations of the Mississippi Department of Corrections and so long as those rules and regulations did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a nonsettling manufacturer (NSM) and two distributors (appellants), appealed an order entered by the Hinds County Chancery Court, Mississippi, which denied them a permanent injunction or a declaration that the NSM fee on cigarettes for sale outside Mississippi under the NSM law, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-70-5 (2010), violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, or the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee Commissioner of Revenue cross-appealed. The state's highest court held that if another state enacted a statute identical to the NSM law and a Mississippi distributor obtained cigarettes for sale outside of Mississippi, then Mississippi would impose a fee on a transaction and the other state would impose a fee on a transaction. If the cigarettes acquired by the Mississippi distributor were sold intrastate, they would be subject to only one fee. If another state enacted an identical statute, interstate commerce would bear a burden that intrastate commerce would not. Section 27-70-5 was not internally consistent and violated the Commerce Clause. The constitutionality of a state tax could not be challenged under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 in state court if an adequate remedy was available under state law. To the extent that Marx v. Truck Renting and Leasing Association Inc., 520 So. 2d 1333 (Miss. 1987), and Burrell v. Mississippi State Tax Commission, 536 So. 2d 848 (Miss. 1988) conflicted with National Private Truck, they were overruled.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contractor sued appellee owners of a home, seeking damages for breach of contract based on work done on the home and a construction lien on the home. The trial court entered judgment for the contractor. The Court of Appeals of Mississippi affirmed the judgment, but reversed the award of attorney's fees and prejudgment interest. The contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There was no written contract for the work, but the trial court found that the contractor's recovery was based in quantum meruit. The appellate court found that there was no applicable statutory basis for the award of attorney's fees or prejudgment interest even if the contractor's recovery was based solely on an express contract rather than quantum meruit. No award of prejudgment interest may have been made where the principal amount was not fixed before judgment. An award of prejudgment interest under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 75-17-1 was improper where a claim for damages was unliquidated. The same considerations which precluded a recovery of prejudgment interest for unliquidated amounts owed under &sect; 75-17-1 applied to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 87-7-3. Here, the amount of the contractor's claim was clearly in dispute, and the trial court resorted to quantum meruit to fix the exact amount of damages. There was no finding that the owners disputed the amount owed in bad faith. Attorney's fees were available only when expressly provided for in either a statute or contract, or when there was sufficient proof to award punitive damages. Miss. Code &sect; 85-7-181 was inapplicable to this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision of the intermediate appellate court was affirmed and the case was remanded to the trial court for a final determination of the contractor's award without prejudgment interest or attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A school district sought a refund of oil and gas severance taxes paid on its royalty interests derived from oil and gas production on sixteenth-section land. The Jones County Chancery Court (Mississippi) ruled that the school district was not liable for severance taxes and that a three-year statute of limitations applied to the school district's refund claim. The Mississippi Department of Revenue and the school district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the oil and gas severance taxes levied under Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect;  27-25-501 to 27-25-525 and 27-25-701 to 27-25-723 did not apply to the school district because the school district did not meet the definition of a &quot;person&quot; subject to the taxes and there was no indication that the school district was subject to the taxes by necessary implication. A statute of limitations did not apply to the school district's refund claim because Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 104 provided that statutes of limitation in civil causes did not run against the state or its subdivisions. It was necessary to remand the case so that the chancery court could determine whether the doctrines of waiver or estoppel applied. Under Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 53-1-73 and 53-1-75, the school district was liable for administrative expense taxes on its royalty interests derived from oil and gas production on sixteenth-section land because the assessments were fees rather than taxes, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 53-1-71 expressly made the state and its subdivisions subject to the fees, and no constitutional provision or other law was violated by requiring school districts to pay the fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the chancery court's judgment insofar as it held that the school district was not liable for severance taxes and that the school district was liable for administrative expense taxes. The court reversed the chancery court's judgment to the extent that the chancery court held that a statute of limitations applied. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Mississippi), which affirmed an order granting the State's motion to amend the grand jury's indictment to charge defendant as a habitual offender under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-83 (Rev. 2007) and convicting him of felony escape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court ruled that a prior conviction for burglary satisfied the violent-crime requirement for habitual-offender status, even though the State had produced no evidence that the burglary involved violence. On appeal, defendant contended that burglary of a dwelling was not a &quot;crime of violence&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 99-19-83. The supreme court held that burglary of a dwelling was not a per se &quot;crime of violence&quot; under &sect; 99-19-83. The Legislature was free to enact a statute that makes burglary of a dwelling a per se crime of violence, but it had not chosen to do so, and the supreme court declined to assume that the legislature intended to do so. Absent such a statute, or proof of an actual act of violence during the commission of a burglary, burglary of a dwelling was not a violent crime for purposes of &sect; 99-19-83. The fact that the Legislature did not choose to provide a list of &quot;crimes of violence&quot; that applied under &sect; 99-19-83 did not render the statute ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee filed an application for retirement benefits with PERS, seeking non-duty-related disability benefits. She claimed to be disabled by severe foot pain, numbness, and swelling. She resigned from her job, which required her to be on her feet most of the day, because of the increasing severity of the pain. PERS denied her claim for disability benefits, finding that as she presented no objective medical evidence of the cause of her pain, there was no proof it was caused by illness. The high court disagreed. Two physicians opined that her objective symptoms were likely caused by peripheral neuropathy. With a doctor's statements that she could not continue the tasks required of her job (walking long distances) and that she was at a maximum medical improvement, she presented enough medical evidence under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 25-11-113(1)(a) (Supp. 2012) to show that she was physically incapacitated for the job she was employed to do, that it was likely permanent, and that she should be retired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court held that the circuit judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant's motion for recusal. Defendant made no showing that the judge engaged in any improper ex parte communications or &quot;earwigging&quot; or that he had any personal knowledge of the disputed facts of defendant's case prior to trial. Pretrial, the circuit judge read the case files, read the indictments, spoke with the supreme court concerning his appointment, and spoke with his nephew as to whether the nephew had been involved in defendant's case. The circuit judge also made clear that his communication pretrial was for administrative purposes only, and he was not discussing the merits of the case. The communications did not violate Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; Cty. R. 1.10 and were not improper. The amendment to the indictment charging defendant with false pretense did not prejudice defendant, and the circuit court did not err in allowing the amendment under Miss.

Appellee filed counterclaims alleging tortious interference with contract and false advertising. The Lafayette County Circuit Court (Mississippi) granted appellee partial summary judgment, finding its contracts were nontransferable. The jury found for appellee; both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant home advertised it would perform funeral services for persons who had preneed contracts with other providers. Appellee denied the customer's request to transfer his contract to appellant home; this suit followed. The high court held that as appellee's contracts lacked a revocation clause, the trial court properly held they were irrevocable under former Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 75-63-63 and were not unilaterally transferable by its customers. Appellee's claims of tortious interference with the contracts of customers still living at the time of trial failed; it could not prove any actual damages, since those customers had irrevocable, nontransferable contracts with appellee to be performed after they died. As the jury found this to be an exceptional case of false advertising, appellee was properly awarded attorney's fees under 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1117(a) of the Lanham Act. Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-1-65(3)(a)(iv), the trial court properly reduced the punitive damage award to $ 0 based on appellant home's negative net worth; appellee having failed to adduce proof of appellant home's net worth during the punitive phase, it could not complain of the reduced verdict on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The damage award to appellee on its tortious interference claim was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial on damages. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother challenged a judgment entered in favor of appellees, a doctor and the doctor's clinic, in the Harrison County Circuit Court (Mississippi) in her wrongful death action. She argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion to amend the pretrial order and in granting the doctor and clinic a new trial because of a faulty jury instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother's son died as a result of calcium chloride in his IV bag. The mother argued that she did not have her expert witness testify to rebut the testimony of the expert of the doctor and clinic. The supreme court held that the trial court did not err by denying the mother's motion to amend the pretrial order. The mother did not move to add her witness as an expert until six months after the discovery deadline. The doctor and clinic disclosed their expert's testimony before the mother's disclosure deadline. They maintained at trial that the doctor did not order any amount of calcium chloride. Thus, their disclosure placed the mother on sufficient notice that their expert would testify to the contents of the IV bag. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting a new trial. The jury instruction stated an incorrect rule of law. It required the jury to find the doctor at fault if the nursing staff improperly administered an IV bag. It imposed liability on the doctor for the nurse's actions that were not committed under the direction or control of the physician. Therefore, the instruction incorrectly imposed vicarious liability on the doctor for the nurse's actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owner (for whom plaintiff estate and trust were substituted after his death) sued defendants, his neighbors and a homeowners association, alleging their negligence caused a sinkhole to develop on his land. Defendants sued third-party defendant city for indemnity. The Hinds County Chancery Court (Mississippi) found defendants and the city jointly and severally liable for the costs of repairs; they appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A culvert system that caused a sinkhole on plaintiff's land drained a lake owned by the neighbors and maintained by the association. The trial court found that 1) the city's sewer-line repairs, along with defendants' failure to repair and maintain the culvert system, caused the sinkhole; 2) the neighbors had an easement by necessity, and the association had an easement by implication, in the culvert system; 3) defendants breached their duty of reasonable care in repairing and maintaining the easement; and 4) their indemnity claim against the city failed since they also participated in the wrongdoing. The appellate court held that as the trial court found that plaintiff had first learned of the sinkhole less than three years before filing suit, it properly found the complaint was timely under the discovery rule, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-49(2) (2003). As the trial court did not find that defendants and the city had colluded to commit a tortious act, its imposition of joint and several liability on them was not permitted under Miss Code Ann. &sect; 85-5-7(4) (2011). After properly dismissing defendants' indemnity claim, the trial court erred by not rendering judgment for the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The portion of the trial court's judgment ordering joint and several liability and awarding damages against the city was reversed, judgment was rendered in favor of the city, and the case was remanded for apportionment of liability between the neighbors and association in direct proportion to percentage of their fault, in accordance with &sect; 85-5-7(5). The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee Mississippi Department of Health (DOH) approved a certificate of need (CON) application filed by appellee, a behavioral health center in Warren County, to add twenty adolescent psychiatric beds in Warren County, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-7-191(4)(a)(iii) (Rev. 2009). Appellant, a behavioral health center in Winston County, appealed from the judgment of the Hinds County Chancery Court (Mississippi), which affirmed the DOH's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1995, the DOH had approved a CON for twenty adolescent psychiatric beds in Warren County but the CON was never acted upon; the CON was the property of a sister company of the Winston County center. Upon filing the application, the Warren County center acknowledged the existence of a legislatively imposed state-wide moratorium on such beds, but relied as the basis for its application on &sect; 41-7-191(4)(a)(iii), which the Warren County center asserted provided an exception to the moratorium by expressly authorizing twenty such beds to be put into service in Warren County. The Winston County center argued the Legislature enacted &sect; 41-7-191(4)(a)(iii) simply to authorize a one-time grant of a CON for Warren County, and did not intend for the CON grant to &quot;remain valid indefinitely.&quot; However, the DOH properly determined that because no beds had ever been established in Warren County under &sect; 41-7-191(4)(a)(iii), the exception to the moratorium on adolescent psychiatric beds remained available to the DOH. The Winston County center's &quot;one-time grant&quot; argument undermined the purpose of the exception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Washington County Circuit Court (Mississippi) to two counts of capital murder and two counts of armed robbery. He filed a post-conviction-relief petition, claiming that the trial court had placed him in double jeopardy by convicting him of capital murder and the underlying felony of armed robbery. The circuit court denied the motion; after an appeal and remand, it again denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and two others robbed a poker game in progress, killing two of the poker players. The capital murder indictments charged the armed robberies of the two murder victims, naming them, and also included the words &quot;and others.&quot; The trial court held that the jury could have found that the murder victims were not victims of armed robbery and still found defendant guilty of the capital murders based on the armed robbery of the other victims. The court rejected this conclusion. The identity of the victim of the underlying felony was an element of the offense of capital murder that was required to be stated in the capital-murder indictment. Accordingly, defendant could not have been convicted on an indictment of capital-murder based on the &quot;armed robbery of others;&quot; his capital-murder convictions had to have been based on the armed robberies of the named victims. Because he was convicted of capital-murder for killing during the commission of the armed robberies of the named murder victims, and then separately for the armed robberies of these same named victims, he was placed in double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated defendant's separate armed-robbery convictions and sentences and reverse the judgment of the circuit court denying his petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 27-7-73 (1993), a taxpayer sued the Mississippi Department of Revenue, challenging the constitutionality of tax statutes. The Hinds County Chancery Court (Mississippi) held that former Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 27-7-37(2)(a)(i) and 27-7-15(4)(i) violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, and awarded the taxpayer damages. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After unsuccessful administrative appeals before the Department (formerly known as the Mississippi State Tax Commission), the taxpayer filed the instant suit. Instead of instituting a pre-deprivation lawsuit under &sect; 11-13-11, challenging the lawfulness of tax collection via a Commerce Clause challenge to the statutes, the taxpayer paid the challenged income taxes and assessment. For this reason, held the high court, &sect; 11-13-11 did not afford the trial court jurisdiction over the taxpayer's appeal. Further, the Department ordered that the taxpayer, pursuant to former &sect; 27-7-73, had to pay the assessment within 30 days or file a petition and bond in the trial court requesting a hearing. By not paying the bond as required by &sect; 27-7-73, the taxpayer failed to perfect its appeal; that the parties stipulated to the trial court's jurisdiction under &sect; 27-7-73 was immaterial, as jurisdiction could not be conferred by consent. Therefore, the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the taxpayer's appeal, and the Department's findings became final.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's orders were vacated and the order of the Department remained in effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant motorist sued appellee, a truck driver's employer, for negligence. A jury awarded appellant damages, which were remitted by the federal district court pursuant to Miss. Code Ann 11-1-60(2)(b). Both parties appealed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit certified this question: Was &sect; 11-1-60(2), which generally limited noneconomic damages to $ 1 million in civil cases, constitutional?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury returned a unanimous general verdict for appellant in the amount of $ 4 million. The special interrogatory and jury verdict did not instruct the jury to itemize the compensatory damages into separate categories. The district court remitted the portion of the verdict that it deemed to represent noneconomic damages to $ 1 million. The high court noted that there was no evidence the parties ever entered into a binding stipulation as to what portion of the verdict represented economic damages and what portion represented noneconomic damages. Thus, the high court could not know with any degree of assurance that the jury awarded appellant more than $ 1 million for noneconomic damages. Accordingly, to rule on the constitutionality of &sect; 11-1-60(2)(b) would require engaging in speculation and guesswork as to what amount the jury might have awarded in economic damages and what amount it might have awarded in noneconomic damages. Therefore, the high court declined to answer the certified constitutional question which, had the case arisen on direct appeal, it would not have reached under the facts presented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of sexual battery against an eight-year-old boy (count one) and of fondling the boy's 11-year-old brother (count two). He argued that the trial court erred by overruling his hearsay objection to statements the younger boy made to a forensic psychologist. The high court agreed. The trial court erred in allowing the psychologist to testify about the younger boy's statement that defendant had put his mouth on the boy's penis, as the trial court made no finding as to the reliability of the statement and did not conduct a hearing outside the presence of the jury as required by Miss. R. Evid. 803(25). That defendant had confessed did not render the error harmless, as the boy's statement was the only evidence corroborating the confession. The older boy testified that defendant sodomized him while they were in a chicken house in Lena, Mississippi, which the boy believed was in Scott County. As Lena was in fact in Leake County, and the jury was never instructed that it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime had occurred in Scott County--an essential element of the offense--defendant's conviction of count two could not stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court held that defendant was not denied his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. Not a single Barker factor weighed in defendant's favor, and one, reason for the delay, weighed heavily against him. The delay in bringing defendant to trial was more than three times the presumptively prejudicial eight-month mark. However, of the 833 days between indictment and trial, 701 were attributable to defendant. The denial of defendant's peremptory challenge without a proper Batson analysis constituted reversible error. The trial could erroneously denied defendant a peremptory strike by holding that a juror's previous service on a jury in a criminal case was not a race-neutral reason for the strike. During voir dire, the juror had expressed regret that the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Defendant's reason for the peremptory challenge, that the juror's responses about a prior jury experience indicated he could be pro-prosecution, qualified as race-neutral. The trial could never addressed the issue of pretext but simply held that the stated reason was not race-neutral. Under Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; Cty. R. 10.01, defendant had a right to twelve peremptory strikes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 41-7-201 (Supp. 2011), purporting to allow the provider to appeal directly to the supreme court, violated Miss. Const. art. VI, &sect; 146 because it impermissibly conferred original jurisdiction on the supreme court, as, (1) under Miss. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 - 2, the legislature could not confer jurisdiction on courts not given or authorized to be given by the Mississippi Constitution, (2) the &quot;revisory&quot; appellate jurisdiction conferred on the supreme court in Miss. Const. art. VI, &sect; 146 applied only to judicial decisions rendered by a tribunal clothed with judicial power, (3) no certificate of need procedure existed at common law, (4) the nature of a certificate of need proceeding was permit-like and often nonadversarial, and (5) the final order of the MDH was issued by the State Health Officer, who was not statutorily required to be an attorney, under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-5.1 (2009), so the MDH lacked the indicia to be considered a tribunal of the character from which the legislature was authorized to grant appeals directly to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three hospitals filed suit against the Mississippi Department of Health (MSDH) and the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), requesting declaratory and injunctive relief. The Hinds County Chancery Court (Mississippi) denied cross-motions for summary judgment, finding that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the Certificate of Need (CON) statutes,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-7-171 et seq., applied to UMMC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">UMMC filed an application for a CON with MSDH. When certain hospitals requested a public hearing in response to the application, MSDH sought two official opinions of the Attorney General (AG). In response to the second AG opinion, UMMC withdrew its application and requested a determination by MSDH of reviewability. MSDH granted the request, finding that UMMC was not required to obtain a CON for the proposed project under the State Health Plan. The hospitals then filed the instant action. The CON statutes applied to UMMC because it was included within the statute's definition of a &quot;person&quot; under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-7-173(p) (Rev. 2009). Furthermore, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-7-191(4)(a)(vi) demonstrated that the legislature intended the CON statutes to apply to UMMC. Finally, there was no conflict between the CON statutes and UMMC's creation statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 37-115-25 (Rev. 2007). However, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-7-191(1)(f) did not diminish the power of MSDH, delegated to it under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-7-187, to adopt rules and regulations to determine when a CON was required. Thus, MSDH had the authority to determine that UMMC did not require a CON for the proposed project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order that denied the medical center's motion for summary judgment, and rendered judgment granted the order. It affirmed the denial of the hospitals' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A corporation settled its delinquent tax liability by paying sums to the State, a private charity, and the law firm, which was hired by the attorney general to pursue the claim. The state auditor demanded that the money paid to the charity and the law firm be turned over to the State because it constituted public funds. The charity complied, but the law firm refused, claiming that the payment of its fees was not made with public funds. First, the money paid to the law firm was part of the corporation's tax liability and, as such, constituted public funds under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 7-7-1 (Rev. 2002). Next, distribution of the public settlement funds to the law firm violated Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 100, which required the tax liability to be paid into the state treasury. Furthermore, the attorney general failed to comply with Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 7-5-7 (Rev. 2002), which required that any special assistants, such as the law firm, be paid from the attorney general's contingent fund or from other funds appropriated to the attorney general's office by the Legislature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee Mississippi Department of Revenue (MDR) upheld the assessment of fees against appellant farm. The farm appealed and filed a motion for relief from the requirement to post a pretrial bond. The MDR objected to the motion and moved to dismiss; the trial court dismissed the case. The farm appealed; the Court of Appeals of Mississippi affirmed. The farm petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The farm filed a pauper's affidavit and a motion for an order allowing it to proceed without posting a pretrial bond. The trial court denied that motion, as it had no discretion to waive the bond requirement imposed by former Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 27-77-5(7) and 27-77-7 (Rev. 2005). Since the farm had neither paid the bond nor paid the tax under protest, the trial court held that it lacked jurisdiction. The intermediate appellate court declined to consider the farm's constitutional challenge to &sect;&sect; 27-77-5 and 27-77-7, because the farm had not raised that issue in the trial court. The high court granted certiorari solely to review whether the pretrial bond requirement derived from former &sect;&sect; 27-77-5 and 27-77-7 related to appellate jurisdiction and was constitutional, or was procedural and unconstitutional. If procedural, it would have constituted an intrusion by the legislature into the assigned powers of the high court and of the judicial branch, and a violation of Miss. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 144 and 146. The high court found that the requirement of a pretrial bond related to appellate jurisdiction and therefore was within the powers of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants argued that the grandparent-visitation statutes,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 93-16-3 and 93-16-5, and the Martin v. Coop factors were unconstitutional in light of Troxel v. Granville and violated their due process rights. The high court disagreed. Section 93-16-3 was narrower than the visitation statute the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated in Troxel, and the Martin factors prohibited chancellors from granting any visitation that would interfere with a parent's substantive due-process rights. The chancellor duly considered the father's wishes but was not required to defer to them, and found that visitation with the grandparents within the children's best interest. A finding of the father's unfitness was not a prerequisite to awarding the grandparents visitation. The chancellor's finding that appellants permanently intended to deny the grandparents visitation was supported by substantial evidence. The chancellor properly weighed and applied the Martin factors. The chancellor's award of visitation during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays in alternate years, two weeks in the summer, and phone calls once per week was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

A threshold issue was whether the amendment to &sect; 71-3-51 that allowed direct appeals from the Commission to the state's high court was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before the amendment to &sect; 71-3-51, appeals from decisions of the Commission had to be filed in the circuit court. The high court directed the parties to brief the issue of whether the amendment to &sect; 71-3-51 violated Miss. Const. art. VI, &sect; 146, which delineated the limits of the high court's jurisdiction. The high court noted that Miss. Const. art. VI, &sect; 146 granted it such jurisdiction as properly belonged to a court of appeal, which meant appeals of decisions rendered by a tribunal clothed with judicial power. The Commission was such a tribunal, as the legislature gave it the power and authority to make decisions that were conclusive and binding. Further, Miss. Const. art. VI, &sect; 146 allowed the high court to exercise jurisdiction on matters  provided by &quot;general law, &quot; and &sect; 71-3-51 was a general law. Therefore, pursuant to Miss. Const. art. VI, &sect; 146, the legislature was constitutionally empowered to confer appellate jurisdiction on the high court over direct appeals from the Commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The high court held that it had jurisdiction over the appeal. As with all workers' compensation cases appealed to the high court, it assigned the case to the intermediate appellate court for decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant estate filed a wrongful death suit against appellees, a nursing home and its management company. The Washington County Circuit Court (Mississippi) denied the home's motions for a mistrial, did not allow the jury to consider appellant's request for punitive damages, reduced the compensatory damages award pursuant to Miss. Code &sect; 11-1-60, and denied appellees' motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). Both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant alleged that the home negligently allowed the decedent to fall out of bed by failing to keep his bed rails upright, which caused injuries that contributed to his death. The trial court reduced the jury's compensatory damages award due to &sect; 11-1-60's $ 500,000 cap on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases. The high court held that as the company's contractual duties were similar to those imposed under Mississippi law for a nursing home administrator and licensee, and there was no evidence it committed an individual wrong, it had been entitled to JNOV. As appellant submitted sufficient evidence that the home's negligence caused the decedent's injuries and that those injuries led to his death, the home was not entitled to JNOV. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the home's motions for a mistrial. The trial court properly declined to submit the punitive damages issue to the jury as it found there was no clear and convincing evidence that the home acted with willful, wanton, or reckless disregard for others' safety or committed fraud. Appellant's challenge to &sect; 11-1-60's constitutionality, raised for the first time on appeal, was not reviewable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The high court reversed that part of the trial court's order denying the company's motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and remand the matter to the trial court to dismiss with prejudice and strike the company's name from the final judgment. It affirmed as to all other issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a school district and others, sued defendants, the State of Mississippi and county officials, challenging Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 19-9-171 (2011), requiring the district to share ad valorem tax revenue it collected from gas terminals and oil refineries with other districts in the county where the terminals and refineries were located. The Jackson County, Mississippi, Chancery Court, found &sect; 19-9-171 constitutional. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, three other school districts in the same county as plaintiff district, were allowed to intervene in the action. Plaintiffs argued that &sect; 19-9-171 violated Miss. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 206, which authorized a school district to levy an additional tax to maintain its schools, by forcing plaintiff district to divide its maintenance tax levy with other districts. The high court agreed. The plain language of art. VII, &sect; 206 granted a district the authority to levy an ad valorem tax and mandated that the revenue collected be used to maintain only its schools. Conversely, no such authority was given for a district to levy an ad valorem tax to maintain schools outside its district. While Miss. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 201 granted the Mississippi Legislature broad power to regulate school finance, the Legislature had no authority to mandate how the funds were distributed, as art. VIII, &sect; 206 clearly stated that the purpose of the tax was to maintain the levying school district's schools. Thus, the plain language of art. VIII, &sect; 206 that granted a school district the right to levy taxes to maintain its schools defined the limits of power granted to the Legislature by art. VIII, &sect; 201.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee, the Attorney General of Mississippi, filed suit to void pardons the Governor of Mississippi had issued to appellant pardonees pursuant to Miss. Const. art. V, &sect; 124. The Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi) issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) requiring appellants to provide proof of publication complying with art. V, &sect; 124 and barring the Mississippi Department of Corrections from releasing them. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During his last days in office, the Governor granted executive clemency to appellants pursuant to Miss. Const. art. V, &sect; 124. The Attorney General filed suit on behalf of the State of Mississippi, contending that appellants failed to publish notice of the petitions for pardons as required by art. V, &sect; 124; he did not challenge the pardons' facial validity. The trial court issued a TRO prohibiting the Mississippi Department of Corrections from releasing appellants until it provided the trial court with sufficient proof of acceptable publication under art. V, &sect; 124. The high court noted that compliance with constitutional provisions that were procedural in nature and committed solely to another branch of government was not justiciable. The exercise of the pardon power, vested solely with the Governor, was of a purely political nature. Under the separation-of-powers doctrine, a facially valid pardon issued by the Governor, who was the head of the coequal executive branch of government, could not be set aside or voided by the judicial branch, based solely on a claim that the procedural publication requirement of art. V, &sect; 124 was not met, or that the publication was insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The high court reversed and rendered the decision of the trial court, vacated the TRO, and rendered judgment dismissing the Attorney General's complaint and the action as barred by the doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Sixteen death-sentenced inmates filed a complaint in the Chancery Court for the First Judicial District of Hinds County (Mississippi), alleging that they were deprived of their right to obtain meaningful state postconviction and federal habeas corpus review of their convictions and death sentences. The chancery court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The inmates appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The essence of the inmates' complaint was that there were defects in both the statutory structure and the performance of the Mississippi Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel (MOCPCC), and that the deficient performance of MOCPCC violated their right to the effective assistance of postconviction counsel in their death-penalty cases. The chancery court properly held that the inmates' attack on the death sentences and postconviction judicial reviews of their convictions was cognizable under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5 (Supp. 2011), a provision of the Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act (UPCCRA), Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-1 et seq. (2011), and, therefore, the chancery court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-7 (Supp. 2011), the Supreme Court of Mississippi was fully capable of considering the inmates' claims in individual applications to file a motion for postconviction relief. Furthermore, under the UPCCRA, the Supreme Court of Mississippi was the only state court with jurisdiction over the claims, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-27 (Supp. 2011).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant patient filed a second malpractice suit against appellees, a doctor and hospital. The prior suit, in which appellees had sought summary judgment due to his non-compliance with Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-36(15), was still pending. The Hinds County Circuit Court dismissed the first suit without prejudice, dismissed the second suit with prejudice, and imposed monetary sanctions on appellant's counsel for filing it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mailed notice as required by Miss.

Due to that failure, appellants moved for summary judgment. Before the trial court ruled on that motion, appellant filed the instant suit. The trial court dismissed both suits and assessed monetary sanctions against appellant's counsel under Miss. R. Civ. P. 11 and Mississippi's Litigation Accountability Act of 1988, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-55-5, finding the second complaint was &quot;frivolous.&quot; The high court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the second complaint with prejudice and in sanctioning counsel because appellant waited the 60 days required by &sect; 15-1-36(15) before filing the second lawsuit. The trial court erred in relying on the doctrine of priority jurisdiction to support its ruling, as that doctrine presupposed a pending action that the plaintiff could proceed upon and obtain &quot;adequate relief,&quot; which was not the case with appellant's first action, since he had failed to wait the required 60 days.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission assessed a contractor's tax against the taxpayer. The taxpayer alleged that the appeal provisions of &sect; 27-77-7 were unconstitutional. The supreme court held that the statute met constitutional standards, and the taxpayer failed to pay the tax or post a bond in order to grant jurisdiction to the chancery court. The taxpayer was afforded due process. Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 27-77-5 and 27-77-7 (Rev. 2005) provided him two full administrative hearings and an opportunity for judicial review in order to contest the validity of the tax assessment. The taxpayer was provided a pre-deprivation process pursuant to &sect; 27-77-5 to contest the validity of the tax. He was heard by the Board of Review and the full Commission. The taxpayer was provided a post-deprivation process. He had fair opportunity to challenge the tax and the ability to receive a refund if successful. Section 27-77-7 provided the taxpayer with the process for seeking a refund or credit for an alleged overpayment of tax or for taxes paid in protest. Its requirement to pay the tax before seeking judicial review provided taxpayers with a fair opportunity to challenge the validity of the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff citizens filed an action against defendant, the Secretary of State, challenging an initiate filed by intervenors, an organization and a member, that the Secretary qualified to be placed on the general election ballot. The citizens contended that the initiative violated Miss. Const. art. 15, &sect; 273(5)(a). They sought review of a judgment entered in favor of the Secretary and intervenors in the Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court held that the initiative was not ripe for review. Even though one could allege that the initiative violated &sect; 273(5)(a), that determination was premature because the supreme court would have to review the substantive constitutionality of the proposal prior to its enactment. Additionally, the supreme court would have to decide issues on appeal that were not clearly or properly addressed by the trial court. Neither the Secretary nor intervenors proffered a motion or counterclaim requesting any relief or judgment. The supreme court was without power to determine the constitutionality of a proposed statute, amendment, or initiative prior to its approval by the legislature or electorate. The wisdom and merit of proposed initiatives were best left to the purview of the voters. Nothing in the Constitution gave the supreme court the authority to review the validity of a proposal prior to its enactment. The supreme court could not invade the territory of the legislature or the electorate to review the substantive validity of a proposed initiative. It would honor the maxim embodied in the constitutional mandate of separation of powers, Miss Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court vacated the trial court's final judgment and rendered judgment dismissing the complaint and the action without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant citizen filed an action against appellee Secretary of State, seeking a declaration that a ballot initiative violated Miss. Const. art. 15, &sect; 273(5)(a), and seeking an injunction against the Secretary from placing the initiative on the ballot. The Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi) denied the citizen's motion for judgment on the pleadings, and held that the initiative was appropriate for ballot placement. The citizen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The initiative attempted to restrict the State's power to transfer certain property to certain parties after taking it by eminent domain. The constitutionality of proposed initiative was not ripe for adjudication, such that any opinion thereon would have been improperly advisory. The case was rushed through the trial court and efficiently punted to the appellate court for expedited review. However, there was no good reason for the frenetic, fast-paced atmosphere surrounding the case. While minimum constitutional and statutory requirements had to be met before a measure was placed on the ballot, a pre-election review of an initiative was limited to matters of form, and not substantive constitutionality. Therefore, the citizen's challenge to the substantive validity of the initiative was not ripe for consideration. Thus, the appellate court declined to consider the issues raised in the appeal, and it intimated no opinion whatever upon the merits of the important questions attempted to be submitted for its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the trial court's judgment, and dismissed the complaint and the action without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Court of Appeals (Mississippi) that upheld her conviction for violating the Mississippi Vulnerable Adults Act of 1986, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43-47-1 to 43-47-39 (Rev. 2009); defendant claimed, among other things, reversible error in the discrepancy between the indictment and the trial court's jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A grand jury indicted defendant for using her mother's money &quot;without her consent.&quot; When the evidence at trial established that defendant had obtained her mother's consent to use the money, the State requested--and the trial judge granted--a jury instruction that allowed the jury to find defendant guilty, even if her mother had given her permission to use the money. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that the wording of the indictment led defendant to believe that having her mother's permission was a complete defense to the charges. Therefore, the jury instructions expanded, beyond the charges in the indictment, the bases on which defendant could be convicted. The discrepancy between the indictment and the jury instructions was material because it prejudiced defendant's ability to defend. Because the error was not cleared up in other instructions, the jury instructions, when taken as a whole, created injustice by expanding, beyond the charges in the indictment, the bases on which defendant could be convicted. A citation to &sect; 43-47-19(1), (2)(b), as its terms were defined in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-47-5, was insufficient to correct the error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant prisoner was convicted of capital murder. He filed numerous petitions for post-conviction relief (PCR), all of which had been denied. The trial court dismissed his most recent PCR motion as a successive writ. The Court of Appeals (Mississippi) affirmed the trial court's dismissal. In its original opinion, the court reversed the prisoner's capital-murder conviction. The State filed a motion for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that it had been without jurisdiction to decide the prisoner's 1999, 2002, and 2004 applications for leave to proceed with PCR motions. Because there was no direct appeal of his conviction or sentence, the prisoner was required to file his PCR motions in the trial court pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-7 (Rev. 2007). The court found that while Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-25 gave the court jurisdiction to address the prisoner's dismissed 2007 PCR motion, the circuit court should exercise initial jurisdiction over the PCR proceedings pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 99-39-25(1), 99-39-7 (Rev. 2007). Because the court had vacated its denials of the 2002 and 2004 applications -- the denials that prompted the trial court to apply the successive-writ bar, the court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the prisoner's latest motion under the successive-writ bar, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-23(6) (Rev. 2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated and set aside its denials of the prisoner's 1999, 2002, and 2004 applications for post-conviction relief. The court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals and the trial court's dismissal of the petition and remanded the case to the trial court for further post-conviction-relief proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court dismissed the inmate's complaint upon a finding of improper venue. The court on appeal held that the inmate's complaint was brought pursuant to statutes governing administrative review procedure in Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 47-5-801 through 47-5-807 (2004) rather than a motion for post-conviction relief subject to dismissal for improper venue. The court explained that earned time was not a reduction of sentence because any inmate released before the expiration of his term of sentence was placed under earned-release supervision until the expiration of sentence. The inmate remained under the jurisdiction of the Department under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-5-138(6) (2004). The inmate's complaint, filed after he exhausted administrative remedies, named the Commissioner of the Department as the only defendant and venue was proper in the county where his office was located. Miss. R. Civ. P. 82(d) provided for transfer to the proper venue rather than dismissal of the inmate's action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated appeals from judgments of the Harrison County Special Court of Eminent Domain (Mississippi) and the Harrison County Chancery Court (Mississippi), appellant and cross-appellant privately-owned public utility sought review of an award for a taking by appellee and cross-appellant City of Gulfport, Mississippi, when the City took over ownership and operation of the utility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The utility provided water and sewer services in an area annexed by the City. About three years after the annexation, the City filed a complaint of eminent domain against the utility. The utility continued to be privately operated until a jury award of compensation to the utility's owners eight years later after which the City took over the assets and operation of the utility. On appeal of a second, higher jury verdict for the utility after remand, the court held that in cases involving privately-owned public utility companies, the applicable date for determining due compensation through the jury's consideration of fair-market value was the actual date the property was transferred rather than the date that the complaint of eminent domain was filed. Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-27-19 (2004), which fixed such value as of the date of the complaint, was unconstitutional as applied to a utility which was obligated to continue to provide service until the taking of its property was completed. The court ordered a new trial on the amount of damages related to post-complaint improvements to the utility's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed chancery court dismissal of the case before it for lack of jurisdiction under the doctrine of priority of jurisdiction. As to the case before the Special Court of Eminent Domain, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further consideration of damages related to post-complaint improvements to the utility's property and with instructions to the trial court on proper jury instructions and closing argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Mississippi's Price-Gouging Statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 75-24-25 (2009), penalized businesses that raised the price of their goods from the price charged in the same market area at or immediately before a proclamation of a state of emergency. Using an average of the weekly prices of the retailer before the declaration of a state-wide declaration of emergency due to an approaching hurricane, the State alleged price-gouging by the retailer. The retailer contended the statute was vague in its use of the phrases &quot;same market area&quot; and &quot;at or immediately before.&quot; The court held that the language of the Price-Gouging Statute provided adequate notice on its face of what was prohibited when a state of emergency was declared. The alleged conduct being prosecuted was the raising of prices after the declaration of a state of emergency, absent justification. The absence of perfect clarity and precise guidance did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague, and it was not void on its face. Also, a declaration of voidness as applied was premature because there had not yet been any determination that the statute had been violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury's verdict was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence as surveillance video showed that a transaction took place between defendant and an agent of the narcotics division at the location alleged in the indictment. The State's closing argument reiterated the jury's duty set forth in the jury instructions and was not an improper &quot;send-a-message&quot; argument. There was sufficient evidence to find defendant was selling a controlled substance with 1,000 feet of a public park as the agent testified a city park was about 100 feet behind defendant's house. At the sentencing hearing, the State presented certified copies of defendant's commitment papers from another state showing that he had been convicted of 3 felonies on 2 separate occasions. Defendant admitted to the convictions. There was sufficient evidence to find that defendant had been previously convicted of 3 felonies and that at least one was for a crime of violence. Thus, he was properly sentenced as a habitual offender under &sect; 99-19-83. His sentence as a habitual offender was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State sought review of dismissal by the Holmes County Circuit Court (Mississippi) of the indictment of defendant police officer for one count of extortion because a probable cause hearing pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-3-28 (2007) had not been held prior to defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-3-28 provided that prior to the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of a teacher, jail officer, counselor at an adolescent offender program or law enforcement officer for criminal conduct while that person was performing official duties, a probable cause hearing had to be held before a circuit court judge. In a matter of first impression, the court concluded that &sect; 99-3-28 (2007) did not apply once an indictment has been returned by a grand jury. The court reasoned that to require a probable cause after an indictment has been returned by a state grand jury would create an inherent conflict with the court's precedent and its rules, including Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; Cty. R. 6.05, which provided that a defendant who has been indicted by a grand jury shall not be entitled to a preliminary hearing. Under the constitutional concept of separation of powers, the court's rules regarding matters of judicial procedure controlled when a statute conflicted with the court's rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the dismissal, reinstated the indictment, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney filed a second petition for reinstatement to the practice of law. He had been disbarred after he pled guilty to conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right. Although he had made strides toward rehabilitating his character and demonstrated a changed life in many ways, he made a false statement to the Bar and failed to cooperate with the Bar during its investigation of his petition. Thus, the supreme court denied his request for reinstatement. The Bar had the right to ask the attorney if he had an expunged record, and the Bar was permitted to inquire about the underlying circumstances or offense. Because the Bar had a right to ask the attorney whether he had anything expunged, the attorney had an obligation to answer the question truthfully. Although the attorney said that his reason for not doing so was that the word &quot;expungement&quot; had never been used with him, the word &quot;expunge,&quot; or some derivation thereof, was used no less than nine times between the two expungement-related orders. The attorney never claimed ignorance of having a prior offense cleared and thus, even if the word &quot;expungement&quot; was not communicated to him, he still knew what occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Parents, individually and on behalf of their eleven-year old daughter, filed an action for damages against the father's apartment owner and its management company (the apartment) after the daughter was raped and impregnated in his building. The Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County (Mississippi), contrary to the jury's findings, assessed fault entirely to the apartment. The apartment appealed. The family cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury established total damages at $200,000, and allocated fault at forty percent to the apartment and sixty percent to the father. The trial court entered final judgment against the apartment for $80,000. However, following post-trial motions, the trial court assessed fault entirely to the apartment and ordered additur of $800,000, contingent upon acceptance. It then entered judgment against the apartment for $1,000,000. Neither party agreed to the additur. The trial court abused its discretion in ordering additur because it failed to make either required finding under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-1-55 (Rev. 2002). There was no finding that the jury was influenced by bias, prejudice, or passion, or that the damages awarded were contrary to the overwhelming weight of credible evidence. Even without this procedural flaw, the trial court's judgment was erroneous because evidence supported the jury's verdict and the verdict was not so unreasonable as to strike mankind at first blush as being beyond all measure, unreasonable in amount and outrageous. However, the trial court did not err in allocating 100 percent fault to the apartment because the father did not breach a defined duty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for entry of a final judgment against the owner and the management company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled nolo contendere in the municipal court to driving under the influence (DUI), possession of an open container of alcohol, and careless driving. Defendant appealed to the county court and was found guilty of DUI and careless driving. The circuit court affirmed. Defendant again appealed. The Court of Appeals (Mississippi) granted the City's motion to dismiss pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-51-81 (Rev. 2002). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to &sect; 11-51-81, defendants aggrieved by a decision originating in justice or municipal court, who had appealed to both the county and the circuit courts, were not entitled to appeal for a third time unless the appeal involved a constitutional question and either the circuit court judge or a Mississippi Supreme Court justice allowed the appeal. However, the &quot;three-court rule&quot; of &sect; 11-51-81 was unconstitutional because it contravened the constitutional mandates imposed upon the legislature and the judiciary in Miss. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2. It was not within the purview of the legislature to determine which litigants could appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court. Accordingly, the court of appeals erred in dismissing the appeal. On the merits, the county court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss because the police officers had probable cause to stop defendant's vehicle where defendant exited a restaurant in an apparent intoxicated state, argued with another patron, entered his vehicle, nearly collided with a patrol car, made an unusually wide turn onto a public road, and failed to stop at a red light.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the judgment of the court of appeals. It reinstated the circuit court's judgment and affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded the cause needed to be remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether petitioner had notice that a cell phone and charger constituted an &quot;electronic device,&quot; and if so, whether she had notice that they were &quot;unauthorized,&quot; and whether law enforcement had definite standards to avoid arbitrary enforcement.

Under the State's theory, defendant killed her husband for insurance proceeds and robbed him of his wallet and a computer's central processing unit.

Specifically, the trial court erred by refusing to allow social worker to testify as to her observations as mitigating evidence. In part, the State presented no evidence or argument that the testimony was outside the field of social work. With regard to conviction, the supreme court stated that although defendant argued that the trial court erred in permitting the State to present evidence of a romantic relationship between herself and her brother, the testimony was at least marginally relevant to explain the relationship between defendant and her brother and the controlling influence that she exerted over him.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's theory was that he participated in the robbery under duress and that the victim was accidentally shot when defendant was handing a codefendant the gun. A witness testified that defendant could not have changed his mind once the codefendant set the events in motion. Defendant testified that he did not want to rob the pizza man, but that he was afraid of the codefendant. Although the codefendant had told defendant that the gun was unloaded, defendant testified that he was still scared because he thought the codefendant would put the bullets in the gun and shoot defendant if he didn't go. Further the portion of a jury instruction requiring the jury to unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was not guilty was improper and could not have been cured by other instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant savagely raped, battered, and murdered his girlfriend's five-year-old daughter. Although defendant was soon arrested and held for 250 days, he was released upon a no-bill. Defendant was not indicted for the crimes until eight years later. There was no statute of limitations for capital murder, and, therefore, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-1-5 (Rev. 2007) did not bar the prosecution. No speedy trial rights were applicable after defendant was released following his initial arrest until after he was later indicted. Weighing all factors, including that defendant never timely asserted his speedy trial right and that he failed to show actual prejudice, his speedy trial and due process rights were not violated. Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-105(3), the case was examined with heightened scrutiny. There was no support in the record that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion or prejudice. Given the evidence presented, there was no doubt that a rational trier of fact could have found the aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the death penalty was not a disproportionate or excessive sentence when compared to other capital-murder cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A Jackson County Circuit Court, Mississippi, convicted defendant of 2 counts of sexual battery and 5 counts of touching a child for lustful purposes. Defendant sought review, arguing that the trial court violated his fundamental right to a fair and impartial jury by failing to excuse jurors for cause, erred in denying his motion to quash the indictment, and erred by not merging the touching convictions with the sexual battery convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court failed to excuse three jurors for cause that declared that he had to prove his innocence in clear contradiction to defendant's fundamental right not to testify. Defendant used three of his peremptory challenges to strike the jurors. While the record showed defendant used all 12 of his peremptory challenges, defendant was unable to show that any of the three challenged jurors were forced upon him be sitting on the trial jury. Defendant argued that the failure of the indictment to allege more specific dates denied him the opportunity to present his defense at trial. The court found that the three-month time frame alleged by the State was sufficient to comply with the date and time requirement of Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; Cty. R. 7.06(5), especially as the case involved sex offenses committed upon minor children. Defendant's right against double jeopardy was not violated because his convictions of touching a child for lustful purposes did not merge with his sexual battery convictions. Sexual battery included separate events involving penetration, while the unlawful touching acts alleged did not involve penetration.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court affirmed. The Board had evidence of the former industrial use of the property, the changes in the area, the high agricultural versus commercial or industrial ratio of county lands, the lack of industrially zoned land, and the varied uses of land in the area despite its agricultural zoning, among other things. The Board had substantial evidence before it to support its decision to rezone. The Board did not engage in spot-zoning because it found a public need for the rezoning and the rezoning was for the betterment of county. The Board had proof that the junkyard met the factors as listed in the county ordinance. The special exception was restricted by the Board in number, area, location, or relation to the neighborhood, and proof was provided as to the promotion of the public health, safety, welfare, morals, order, comfort, convenience, appearance, prosperity, or general welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced to die by lethal injection for the capital murders of two victims during the commission of a robbery. He brought a direct appeal to the supreme court, which affirmed both his convictions and sentences. The record revealed that there was probable cause to arrest defendant and thus, the items seized from defendant's person incident to his arrest and the custodial statement he provided incident to his arrest were lawful and should not have been suppressed. Therefore, the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress his warrantless arrest and the seizures incident thereto was appropriate. There was a substantial basis for the magistrate judge and the trial court to conclude that probable cause existed to issue a warrant. In part, defendant's aunt informed an agent that just the previous day, she had witnessed defendant engaged in the manufacture and possession of illegal narcotics and in the possession of a stolen vehicle. Further, the person killed did not have to have an interest in the property taken and defendant's death sentence was also appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant wife sought review of a judgment of the Jackson County Chancery Court (Mississippi) granting appellee husband a divorce on the ground of uncondoned adultery, under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-5-1 (Rev. 2004), distributing the parties' assets, and ordering the wife to pay child support, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-19-101 (Rev. 2009).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">First, the chancellor did not err in classifying the wife's severance package and IRA as marital property because they were distributed to her two years before the divorce. Second, the chancellor did not commit manifest error in reclassifying the husband's pension as nonmarital property because the husband showed proof that the pension was fully funded prior to the marriage. Furthermore, the wife's counsel conceded that the pension was nonmarital property. Third, the wife was procedurally barred from raising the issues of whether the husband's stock shares and IRA were marital property because she never asserted the issues in the trial court. However, the chancellor erred in ordering the wife to pay an amount of child support in excess of the statutory child-support guidelines under &sect; 43-19-101(1). While the chancellor may have based the award on the wife's earning capacity rather than her actual earnings, no on-the-record findings were made that her earning capacity was considered. Further, on remand, the trial court was directed to revisit the issue of liability for the second mortgage or line of credit on the marital home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed those portions of the judgment that awarded child support and that ordered the wife to be responsible for the second mortgage on the marital home. It remanded the issues to the trial court. The court further stated that once the chancellor reconsidered the second mortgage issue on remand, adjustments could be made to the total distribution of assets to each party. The court affirmed the judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

Further, the trial court did not err in permitting the jury to hear informant testimony where the trial court granted a cautionary instruction that advised the jury to view informant testimony with caution and suspicion. While the trial court erred in allowing a letter to be read during sentencing because defendant had no opportunity to cross-examine the author of the letter, in light of the totality of the evidence presented during the sentencing phase, the error was harmless.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a toxic tort action, appellant claimant sought damages under theories of negligence, intentional tort, conspiracy, private conspiracy under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1985(3), strict liability, trespass, private nuisance, and failure to warn against appellee corporations. The Grenada County Circuit Court, Mississippi, found that her claims were time-barred and granted summary judgment for the corporations. The claimant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant argued that the statute of limitations began to run when she discovered that her medical problems were the result of her exposure to toxic chemicals. The corporations contended that the limitations period began to run when the claimant discovered or was diagnosed with her illnesses. The court agreed that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-35 (2003) was inapplicable as the claimant's intentional tort claim was not listed in that code section. The court concluded that the claimant's cause of action accrued when she was last diagnosed with an injury or a disease. She was last diagnosed with a medical condition that she alleged was related to exposure to toxic chemicals approximately five years before she filed her action. Thus, her claims were time-barred under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-49(2) (2003). The claimant argued that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 9658 (2006) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act preempted &sect; 15-1-49(2). Because there was no evidence in the record to support her argument, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the claimant failed to carry her burden of showing that &sect; 9648 preempted &sect; 15-1-49(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In three consolidated cases, the Hancock County Circuit Court (Mississippi) held that the Seawall Act, Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following Hurricane Katrina, appellee county used Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 65-33-23 (Rev. 2005) of the Seawall Act to condemn the landowners' property for a temporary construction easement to rebuild the county seawall. The landowners failed in their burden to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the Seawall Act was unconstitutional. While the county acted under the authority granted by the Seawall Act, it conceded that the RPAPA also applied. The RPAPA did not repeal or supersede any part of the Seawall Act, and the two statutes were applied in conjunction with each other. Further, the county complied with the constitutional and statutory requirements in condemning the property. Any discrepancies between the procedures employed and the statutory requirements were harmless errors because they did not pertain to the power of the board to condemn the property, nor did they infringe on the landowners' constitutional rights. Further, the trial court did not err in finding that the landowners were entitled, upon request, to a jury trial, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 65-33-33 (Rev. 2005). Finally, the Eminent Domain Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-27-1 to 11-27-51 (Rev. 2002), was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the circuit court and remanded the matter to that court for a jury trial, if requested by the landowners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon review, the court found that defendant failed to establish that the verdict was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence. In deciding that a confidential informant's testimony regarding defendant's prior cocaine sales was admissible, the trial court conducted a Miss. R. Evid. 403 balancing test and gave the jury a limiting instruction concerning the testimony. Thus, there was no error in admitting the testimony. Defendant's Batson challenge failed because he did not establish that the facts and other relevant circumstances raised an inference that the prosecutor engaged in a pattern of peremptory strikes on the basis of race. The trial court's finding that there was no racial discrimination was not clearly erroneous or against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Defendant's sentence was not disproportionate to his offenses or cruel and unusual punishment. His sentence was within the statutory range, it was mandatory under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-83 (2007), and he did not show it was grossly disproportionate to his crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action for damages against appellees, City of Jackson and a construction company, alleging inverse condemnation, negligence, trespass, and nuisance arising out of the city's efforts to improve a corridor, appellant leaseholder challenged a judgment of the Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which granted summary judgment in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the course of an improvement project, the city obtained a deed from a property owner and the leaseholder, conveying interest in the property to the city in exchange for consideration. The leaseholder filed an action for damages it allegedly suffered when the construction affected its business. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city, finding that the leaseholder had released the city from any and all claims arising from the project and that the consideration paid for the release was an accord and satisfaction of such claims. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding that the trial court erred in allowing the city to amend its answer two years after the action was filed. Pursuant to Miss. R. Civ. P. 8(c), the city waived its right to assert the affirmative defenses of release and accord and satisfaction 26 months after it filed its original answer; the city's filing of an answer, coupled with its participation in the discovery process, sufficiently established that it actively participated in the litigation. The record revealed no unusual or extreme circumstances that explained the city's failure to assert timely the affirmative defenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of capital murder in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(2)(e). The circuit court denied his most recent motion for post-conviction relief (PCR) under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-27. The Court of Appeals (Mississippi) affirmed, holding that the circuit court was without jurisdiction to entertain the motion absent leave of the supreme court pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-7 (Rev. 2007). Writ of certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The current PCR motion was the fourth time in which the disposition of one of defendant's PCR motions had been appealed to the supreme court. The circuit court continued to have exclusive initial jurisdiction over defendant's PCR proceedings because defendant never directly appealed his conviction and sentence to the supreme court. The court of appeals decision that the most recent PCR motion was procedurally barred as an impermissible successive writ was in error because the supreme court incorrectly applied the procedural bar to defendant's 1999, 2002, and 2004 applications. Defendant's arguments regarding the substantive deficiencies in his indictment were excepted from the procedural bars of the Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-1 et seq., because defendant's arguments implicated fundamental due-process concerns. On the merits, defendant's indictment was fatally insufficient to charge him with capital murder or burglary because it failed to assert the underlying offense that comprised the burglary. The indictment also failed to charge him with murder or manslaughter because it omitted the phrase without the authority of law or unlawfully.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the dismissal of the most recent PCR motion. It also reversed defendant's conviction for capital murder and remanded the case to the circuit court without prejudice of the State's right to bring a charge against defendant founded upon a proper indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two judicial complaints were filed against the circuit court judge.

The Commission moved to dismiss order of interim suspension. The supreme court held that the Commission exceeded its authority under Miss. Const. art. 6, &sect; 177A. The supreme court had neither been presented with nor asked to approve any agreement between the Commission and the circuit court judge. It could not ignore the serious, willful nature of the admitted acts of criminal and judicial misconduct. The supreme court could not allow the dismissal of formal complaints in two separate cases pursuant to the circuit court judge's resignation or any mere agreement not to seek judicial office in the future.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff personal representatives filed a complaint against defendants, a nursing home, its administrator, and others, alleging that their decedent died as the result of inadequate medical care at a church camp where nursing home residents were taken. The personal representatives filed an almost identical action in Louisiana. The Hinds County Circuit Court, Mississippi, dismissed the complaint and the personal representatives appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On the eve of Hurricane Katrina, the nursing home evacuated its elderly residents from Louisiana to a church camp in Mississippi. The complaint alleged that the decedent was one of the evacuated residents, and that she died as the result of inadequate medical care at the church camp. On appeal, the personal representatives argued that the circuit court erred by dismissing the case for lack of personal jurisdiction or forum non conveniens. Affirming, the court ruled that under Mississippi's wrongful-death statute--Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-7-13 (Rev. 2004)--and interpretive caselaw, the Mississippi action was properly dismissed due to the pendency of the prior-filed Louisiana wrongful-death action. Under &sect; 11-7-13, there was to be one suit for the same death; under Long v. McKinney, all claims had to be joined in that single action. The court held that a wrongful-death suit filed in Mississippi was subject to dismissal during the pendency of a suit for the same wrongful death in a sister state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an appeal of a decision of the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County (Mississippi), appellants sought a determination that they were the heirs at law of the decedent in order receive the assets of her estate through representation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In order for appellants to inherit from the decedent, their putative aunt, through representation, they first had to establish paternity through their putative father. The putative father died in 1978, and appellants did not try to establish paternity until 2003, after the death of the decedent. Appellants failed properly to adjudicate themselves as the illegitimate children of their putative father in the time prescribed by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15. As such, the petition to be determined heirs of the decedent was barred by the time provision of &sect; 91-1-15. Additionally, &sect; 91-1-15 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Further, appellants were not deprived of either their procedural or substantive due process rights. Mississippi had a legitimate state interest in the legislation propounded in &sect; 91-1-15, therefore, the statute did not violate any substantive due process rights. In addition, appellants had notice of the putative father's death and would have been afforded a hearing for adjudication of paternity, however, they failed to make such a petition within the statutory limits of &sect; 91-1-15.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had no constitutional right to a jury trial on the issue of habitual-offender status. Although defendant alleged numerous claims of ineffective assistance, all of the claims failed. There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of three counts of armed robbery. The jury was presented with testimony and evidence that defendant feloniously took money from three victims, against their will, by putting each man in fear of immediate injury by the exhibition of a deadly weapon, i.e., the gun. A rational jury could have found the essential elements of armed robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. As the three victims and another witness identified defendant and defendant took the stand only to say that all the witnesses were lying, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both plaintiffs and defendants claimed ownership to the mineral rights of two tracts of land. Plaintiffs brought suit seeking to confirm and quiet title and also seeking a declaratory judgment. The Covington County Chancery Court (Mississippi) granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, finding that a 1942 tax sale was valid. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the lower court addressed the due process issue relating to the 1942 tax sale, the appellate court was not prohibited from considering the issue on appeal. At the time of the 1941 assessment, real property rolls were examined and equalized every two years, and the next equalization was not to occur until 1942. Ad valorem taxes were assessed for 1941 in compliance with applicable law, and the board of supervisors was under no obligation, either by statute or constitution, to equalize the land roll in that year. In addition, because the identity and whereabouts of the owners of the severed mineral interests were not readily ascertainable, publication and notice to the surface owners were sufficient to satisfy the due process requirements of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 14. The appellate court presumed that the tax sale was properly advertised given the presumption that public officials perform their lawful duties. The tax assessor was under no obligation to comb the land records to identify individuals who might have appeared to have had an interest in the land's minerals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, former church parishioners, appealed from the holding of the Harrison County, MS, Chancery court which held in favor of defendants, a diocese, a bishop, and a reverend, on the parishioners' claims relief after the bishop closed the church, which had been damaged in Hurricane Katrina. The chancellor found that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction based on the church autonomy doctrine of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parishioners asserted, in part, that the bishop held the church property in trust for the members of the church, that any financial contributions designated for reconstruction of the church were held in trust for that particular purpose, that defendants had violated said trusts, and that the reverend had made misrepresentations in soliciting donations for the rebuilding efforts. First, the court held that the extent of the parishioners' interest in the church property, if any, was inextricably tied to their status as members of the parish. Because such church or parish no longer existed, the parishioners had no standing to assert a claim for any interest they may or may not have had in church property. Second, the court determined that the chancellor erred in dismissing the parishioners' claims that defendants improperly diverted designated funds. While churches had large, almost-unfettered discretion in their administrative decision-making, they were not entitled to violate recognized duties or standards of conduct. Thus, subject matter jurisdiction existed over a claim that a religious entity breached a fiduciary duty by improperly diverting designated funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The instant court affirmed the chancellor's finding that subject matter jurisdiction did not exist over the parishioners' claim that the church property was held in trust. The court reversed the chancellor's dismissal of the parishioners' breach of fiduciary duty claim for the diversion of designated funds, as well as their intentional misrepresentation claim against the reverend. These claims were remanded these claims for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer was a furniture manufacturer. The employer used a certain adhesive that contained a neurotoxin and it was necessary to have the area well ventilated. Despite the savings the employer enjoyed from using the adhesive it did not install mechanical ventilation exhausts outside the building on the glue line. The employees eventually were hospitalized because of their exposure to the neurotoxin. At issue on appeal was the application of the intentional tort exception to the Mississippi Workers' Compensation Act. Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 71-3-1 et seq. The Supreme Court found that given the considerable amount of testimony offered by the employees and the management personnel of the employer the denial of the JNOV motion was proper. The experts' testimony was properly admitted under Miss. R. Evid. 702 because their qualifications were not legitimately questioned, and their testimony was sufficiently relevant and reliable. There was sufficient evidence to meet the &quot;clear and convincing&quot; standard required for punitive damages under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-1-65 and the court's determination of the employer's net worth at the time of judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inn was located in a residential district. The amendments exempted the inn from having to obtain a new use permit in order to operate a restaurant. The supreme court held that the amendments constituted illegal spot zoning.

The amendments significantly altered and expanded the activities previously allowed on residential district properties and effectively rezoned the inn from residential to commercial property. They allowed the inn to conduct highly commercial operations within an area restricted to one- and two-family dwellings. Before the amendments, the only use permits allowed in residential zones were for limited purposes. With the addition of a bed and breakfast with restaurant, the inn was granted permission to operate a general restaurant within a residential zone, an activity allowed in areas zoned commercial districts. In addition, by allowing existing bed and breakfast inns to operate restaurants &quot;as of right,&quot; the amendments exempted the inn from having to apply for a use permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's wife found a videotape among her husband's belonging. The tape depicted nude male children. The wife confronted defendant who made a comment about going back to California, where he could do it again. The wife contacted a police detective. On appeal, defendant presented four issues: (1) whether the marital privilege caused his wife to be incompetent to testify; (2) whether the males in the video were engaged in &quot;sexually explicit conduct;&quot; (3) whether the statutes were unconstitutional; (4) whether the prosecution made improper arguments. The supreme court determined that spousal incompetence was not applicable, under Miss. R. Evid. 601(a)(2) and Miss. R. Evid. 504(d), because defendant was being prosecuted for a criminal act against any child. The supreme court also adopted the Dost factors and concluded the jury was justified in its finding that the images it viewed depicted &quot;sexually explicit conduct.&quot; Defendant's constitutional argument was procedurally barred due to his failure to assert it at the trial-court level. As to the prosecutor's comments in closing arguments, defendant did not object; therefore, the issue was waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed those claims where the decedent's wife failed to provide pre-suit notice because strict compliance with the 90-day-notice requirement in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11(1) (Rev. 2002) was required. Further, the notice of claim letters that were sent were insufficient under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11(2) because they did not contain allegations of the nature of the negligent conduct, the time and place of alleged conduct, the names of persons involved, the damages sought, or claimant's residence. The third complaint, which substituted the names of actual physicians for the John Does, did not relate back to the original complaint under Miss. R. Civ. P. 9(h) because the wife failed to exercise due diligence to discover the identities of the John Doe physicians where she received records pertaining to the patient's treatment prior to filing suit. As to other health care providers, however, the court held that the trial court erred in holding that the wife's complaint failed to toll the statute of limitations because the complaint did have a tolling effect until the trial court issued its ruling on the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a legal malpractice case, plaintiff clients, a husband and wife, appealed summary judgment granted by the Kemper County Circuit Court (Mississippi) in favor of defendant attorneys. The clients further challenged an order of the circuit court that held that the attorneys were not required to turn over their case file to the clients but that the clients could copy the file at their own expense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorneys represented the clients in products liability litigation. The representation agreement established attorney fees for the litigation, which increased as the litigation progressed. Under the agreement, if the case was settled after the discovery period expired, the attorney fee would be 45 percent of the settlement amount. After the parties settled, the attorneys withheld their fee of 45 percent. Dissatisfied with the fee withheld, the clients filed a legal malpractice claim. On review, the court affirmed summary judgment due to the enforceability of the fee agreement, which the clients did not challenge. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying clients' motion to compel the attorneys to surrender their case file to the clients as being the clients' property. Rather, the trial court properly ordered that counsel make the case file available to the clients and allow the clients to copy as much of the case file as they chose at the client's expense; the trial court's order complied with Miss. R. Prof. Conduct 1.16(d) in that it required the attorneys to do what was reasonably practicable in order to protect the clients' interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Tallahatchie County Circuit Court, Mississippi, convicted defendant of murder and sentenced him to life in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court found that defendant did not object contemporaneously to the granting of the jury instruction, and he raised the issue for the first time on appeal. The murder instruction was not fatally defective as it accurately followed the requisite elements of murder prescribed by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(1)(a) (Rev. 2006). The trial court appropriately struck all nine venire persons due to their explicit inability to function as impartial members of the jury. Nothing in the record substantiated defendant's argument that one juror misrepresented his visual abilities to the trial court. Because defendant never applied for a change of venue in the trial court, he was barred from raising this argument on appeal. The neighbor's hearsay testimony did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI, right, because it was not made for any prosecutorial purpose. The investigator's testimony was not hearsay. There was no ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant was validly convicted by a jury verdict accepted and recorded in court. The evidence did not support a heat-of-passion manslaughter jury instruction. There was ample evidence to support the verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the George County Circuit Court (Mississippi) that convicted him of capital murder under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19 (Rev. 2006) during the commission of a robbery under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-79 (Rev. 2006), arguing that the prosecution failed to produce evidence sufficient to convict him of the underlying felony of robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his married girlfriend were staying at a motel together. After defendant left, the body of his murdered girlfriend was found in the room they shared. On review of defendant's conviction, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of the underlying felony of robbery because defendant's possession of the murder victim's wallet created a reasonable inference that it was stolen. The State's theory of the case was that defendant went back to the motel to get back what was rightfully his--the money in the victim's wallet, and the evidence, although circumstantial, supported that theory. During the State's case-in-chief, evidence was presented to establish that, after defendant left the motel earlier in the day, the victim feared his return, and when defendant did return and was unable to access the room, a motel employee told him that the door was locked from the inside. Additional evidence was presented that defendant had received a significant amount of money from his mother for a business that he planned to start and that defendant was supporting the victim and was the source of the cash found inside her wallet.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction and the capital sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees alleged injuries from fumes because there was no ventilation, protective gear, or sufficient air testing. The circuit court found that the employees alleged sufficient facts to satisfy the intentional tort exception to the application of the Act. The employees sought to expand the scope of egregious conduct excluded from the Act to include acts which were substantially certain to cause injury. The employer sought to enlarge the scope of the exemption test. The court held that the Act was exclusive absent an actual intent to injure the employee. Here, the employees' injuries arose out of and in the course of employment, under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 71-3-3(b) (2000). The employees' claims of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the employer were not precluded by the Act as a matter of law. The circuit judge properly admitted the expert testimony of the employees' experts, as their qualifications were not legitimately questioned, and their testimony was sufficiently relevant and reliable. Applying net worth of the employer at the time of trial, the circuit court properly reduced the punitive damages, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-1-65(3)(a)(v).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a medical malpractice and wrongful death action, plaintiff wrongful death beneficiary appealed a judgment of the Mississippi Court of Appeals that affirmed the dismissal of her claims against defendant doctors, arguing that the trial court erred in dismissing on the basis that she failed to comply with the 60-day notice requirement of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-36(15) (Rev. 2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wrongful death beneficiary filed a medical malpractice and wrongful death suit against the doctors following the demise of the doctors' patient.

The trial court granted the motion, and after the appellate court affirmed, the wrongful death beneficiary petitioned for certiorari, arguing that, because the doctors were not served with a copy of the summons and complaint until more than 60 days after the notice of intent was received by them, she had complied with the statutory provisions. In the alternative, she argued that, even if her cause of action had been properly dismissed, she was entitled to refile. On review, the court held that, although the appellate court decided the issue correctly, it granted certiorari to reiterate that dismissal for failure to comply with the pre-suit notice requirements of Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A chancellor of the Jones County Chancery Court (Mississippi) entered a final judgment that approved appellant city's application to enlarge the city's boundaries as to a southern parcel only. The city challenged whether the provision of H.B. 1730 violated Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 88 and whether the chancellor's finding that it was unreasonable to annex a northern parcel was manifestly wrong.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city claimed that H.B. 1730, &sect; 12, contained a poison pill provision that required all or none of a utility district to be annexed. The court found that the legislation did not violate Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 90--the Legislature could enact by both a general law and a local and private law. Section 12 did not offend art. 4, &sect; 88, and was not at odds with the general laws regarding annexation. The chancellor properly considered 1) the need to expand to accommodate spillover growth, internal growth, and population growth; 2) the city's need for development land; 3) the need for planning in the annexation area; 4) increased traffic counts; 5) the need to maintain and expand the city's tax base; 6) the remaining vacant land; and 7) environmental influences. Those factors did not support the need for annexation. Annexation was not reasonable as to the other parcels that were largely rural, were not &quot;urbanizing areas,&quot; and were not in need of municipal services. There was little evidence that better municipal services would result if annexation were allowed. The chancellor did not apply an erroneous legal standard and his findings were based on substantial, credible evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the chancellor's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Hinds County Chancery Court, Mississippi, dismissed appellant employee's action for wrongful termination against appellee Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC). The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee argued that because HB 1279, 2004 Miss. Laws 595, &sect; 13 (Section 13) directly amended Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 25-9-127(1) (Rev. 2006) without any reference to it, and because the purported statutory modifications were not inserted at length into the statute, the employee argued that Section 13 ran afoul of Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 61. The supreme court found that the language of Section 13 did not purport to insert any words or expressly change any of the terms of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 25-9-127(1) and, therefore, was not a direct amendment. It exempted the personnel decisions of a specific agency, MDOC, from State Personnel Board procedures regarding terminations for a period of one year. It qualified as an amendment by implication, which was not violative of Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 61. Section 13 affected a general class of people due to a mandated reorganization of the department. Even though the legislative amendment extinguished the employee's property rights as to his job, he was not denied due process. Therefore, the employee was entitled to due process only as provided under Section 13. The employee's other claims were not presented in his complaint before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction of intimidating a judge under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-9-55 (Rev. 2006) by the Lauderdale County Circuit Court (Mississippi), arguing that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a formal hearing to determine his competency and erred in admitting the statement's of a psychologist into evidence and arguing that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-9-55 was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I and Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While incarcerated, defendant wrote more than a hundred threatening letters to two judges. While speaking with a psychologist who treated jail inmates, defendant repeated his threats against the judges. As a result of the threats made, defendant was charged with and convicted of two counts of intimidating a judge. On review of defendant's conviction, the court concluded that, despite the trial court's failure to strictly comply with Miss. Unif. Circ. &amp; Cty. R. 9.06, defendant displayed an understanding and knowledge of the proceedings. Although he was an eccentric character, there was no showing that defendant was incompetent. Further, the trial court did not err in finding that defendant's communications with the psychologist were not confidential, privileged, and inadmissible under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 73-31-29 (Rev. 2008). Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-21-97 (Rev. 2005) created an exception to &sect; 73-31-29 when a patient made a threat of physical violence. Finally, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-9-55 was not unconstitutional because threatening speech was not protected speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sought review of an order from the Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which dismissed their medical negligence action against defendants, a physician and a hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs brought a medical negligence action against defendants. The hospital raised as affirmative defenses plaintiffs' failure to comply with Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-1-58(1)(a) (Supp. 2008), and plaintiffs' failure to comply with conditions precedent to the initiation of litigation. The physician moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that plaintiffs failed to wait 60 days after notice before filing suit. The trial court dismissed the action. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to file with the complaint a certificate of compliance as required by &sect; 11-1-58. The complaint did not need to be dismissed simply because plaintiffs failed to attach a certificate or waiver. However, the trial court properly dismissed the complaint for failure to comply with the notice requirement of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-36(15) (Rev. 2003). Because defendants did not have 60 days' prior written notice of the intention to begin the action, the lawsuit was not lawfully filed, and it was of no legal effect. The complaint, however, should have been dismissed without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was tried and convicted by a jury in the Lee County Circuit Court, Mississippi, for the crime of enticement of a child for sexual purposes, in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-5-33 (Rev. 2006). Defendant was sentenced as a habitual offender to a term of life imprisonment without parole pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-83 (Rev. 2007). After his posttrial motions were denied, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The instant court concluded that defendant's statements to law enforcement officials were properly admitted. Defendant's statement of &quot;I prefer a lawyer&quot; was only an ambiguous mention of possibly speaking with an attorney and was insufficient to invoke the right to counsel. A reasonable police officer would not have understood this statement alone to be an unequivocal assertion of the right to counsel. Defendant was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction on misdemeanor indecent exposure. Based on the overwhelming evidence, no reasonable jury could have found defendant not guilty of any element of the principal charge. Although defendant argued that the trial court erred in limiting defense counsel's closing argument with regard to reasonable doubt, defense counsel's discontinuance of his reasonable doubt argument was not trial court error but rather a choice on the part of defense counsel. Even assuming that the trial court impermissibly prohibited defense counsel's reasonable doubt argument, the error was harmless. Based on the overwhelming evidence of guilt, this error, if any, had no effect on the ultimate outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a negligence action stemming from an automobile collision, defendants, a governmental agency and its employee, appealed an interlocutory order of the Warren County Circuit Court (Mississippi) that denied their motion to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint based upon plaintiffs' failure to strictly comply with the 90-day notice requirement of the Mississippi Tort Claims Act at Miss. Code Ann. 11-46-11 (Rev. 2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After being involved in an automobile collision with defendant employee, plaintiffs served a notice of claim letter to defendant governmental agency and then filed their complaint only seven days after sending the notice letter. Defendants moved to dismiss, but the circuit court denied their motion. On review, the court held that the Mississippi Tort Claims Act at Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11(1) (Rev. 2002) established a pre-suit notice requirement that a claimant must meet in order to maintain an action against a governmental entity; specifically, a claimant was required to give a 90-day notice before filing suit. The 90-day notice requirement was a mandatory rule that Mississippi courts strictly enforced, and the notice requirement was jurisdictional in nature. Mississippi law required strict compliance with the Mississippi Tort Claims Act's 90-day notice requirement. Because plaintiffs failed to strictly comply with the requirement, the circuit court never had jurisdiction over their complaint. Therefore, the circuit court erred in denying defendants' motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order of the circuit court was reversed, and the case was remanded for dismissal of the cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a Mississippi Tort Claims Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-46-1 to 11-46-23 (Rev. 2002) medical-negligence suit, appellant claimants challenged the summary judgment entered by a trial court in favor of appellees, a doctor and a hospital, holding that the discovery rule did not apply because the decedent's injuries were not latent. In its original opinion, the court held that the claim was time-barred, but granted the claimant's motion for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue was the application of the Act's statute of limitations. The language of &sect; 11-46-11 required courts to look past the date of the wrongful conduct to the earliest date all the necessary elements of a tort claim were present, remembering that damages may not manifest until long after the wrongful conduct. All elements of all claims were present by April 17, 2000, when the decedent died. Since notice was not provided until February 13, 2002, the suit was time-barred, unless the discovery rule applied. The Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-7-13 (Rev. 2004) wrongful-death claims matured, and the statute of limitations on those claims began to run, on April 17, 2000 because that was the first day (&quot;if death had not ensued&quot;) that the decedent could have brought a claim. Although the Act's discovery rule was judicially created, subsequent to the court's incorrect interpretation in Barnes, &sect; 11-46-11(3) was re-enacted without addressing or countermanding the Barnes decision; the Legislature acquiesced and tacitly approved and incorporated into the statute the Barnes' discovery rule. Because the question of whether  notice was timely provided was not addressed, reversal and remand were required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment and remanded the case for a hearing on the question of whether, within a year of providing notice to defendants, the claimants knew or, by exercise of reasonable diligence, should have known of both the decedent's injury and the alleged tortious act or omission that proximately caused it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When filing her wrongful death complaint, the daughter included neither a certificate nor a disclosure, as required by Miss.

The supreme court noted that the parties raised and briefed the issue of whether failure to attach a certificate to the complaint in compliance with &sect; 11-1-58 should result in dismissal of the suit. The supreme court was unable to ignore the constitutional imperative that the Legislature refrain from promulgating procedural statutes which required dismissal of a complaint. A complaint, otherwise properly filed, may not be dismissed, and need not be amended, simply because the plaintiff failed to attach a certificate or waiver. The certificate did not indicate whether the daughter's attorney consulted with the expert prior to, or after, filing the complaint. If the former, then the daughter was in compliance with the enforceable portion of &sect; 11-1-58. If the latter, then the pretrial statutory requirement was not met, and the trial court had to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was found guilty of capital murder and he was sentenced to death. He filed an application for leave to proceed in the trial court and motion for other relief under the Mississippi Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-1 et seq., and more specifically, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-27 (Rev. 2007). The supreme court denied his request for postconviction relief. Even if counsel had successfully procured an independent DNA expert and that expert had testified that the inmate's DNA was not present on the rape kit samples taken from the victim, that did not exonerate the inmate of the sexual battery charge. Further, counsel's consultation with a registered nurse evidenced counsel's diligence when the request for independent pathologist funding was denied. And assuming that the inmate's counsel was deficient, the inmate failed to prove that a doctor's reports and affidavits did not contain evidence that would have created a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, the outcome of the inmate's trial would have been different.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was tried and convicted in the Circuit Court of Winston County, Mississippi, on one count of armed robbery, for which he was sentenced to serve thirty years, and two counts of aggravated assault, for which he was sentenced to serve twenty years each, with the sentences to run concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victims were at their home when they heard a knock at their carport door. They opened the door to find defendant and another young male dressed in black sweatshirts and pants. Defendant made up a story about running out of gas and asked to use the phone. When one of the victims returned with a phone, defendant put a hood over his head. His cohort shot two of the victims. Defendant and his cohort ran out of the carport and fled in their vehicle. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant aided and abetted the crimes of armed robbery and aggravated assault. The State proved the essential elements of armed robbery. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in giving the jury a supplemental instruction. The prosecution's reference to other local armed robberies which involved a similar pattern of behavior was for illustrative purposes and did not require reversal. Defendant's sentence was not disproportionate to his role in the crime. His sentence of thirty years on the armed robbery charge, and twenty years each on the aggravated assault charges, were within the statutory limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for robbing a store clerk at gunpoint. On appeal, the court held that because no evidence was offered to the trial court to support defendant's claim of a Batson violation, the court could not conclude that the trial court clearly erred in denying the white defendant's request for a Batson hearing based on the State's using peremptory challenges against seven African-American potential jurors. The trial court did not err by allowing defendant's prior conviction of theft of property to be used by the State for impeachment purposes under Miss. R. Evid. 609 because, even though defendant's conviction occurred more than 10 years before the instant trial, in the interest of justice exception was available as a result of defendant's flight, which delayed his trial for the prior theft of property charge. The trial court did not err by refusing to give an instruction on the lesser-included offense of robbery because defendant admitted to instructing an accomplice to take the cash box portion of the cash register after the pistol was threateningly displayed toward the clerk, and such participation rendered defendant a principle in the armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;ON DIRECT APPEAL: REVERSED AND RENDERED. ON CROSS-APPEAL: AFFIRMED. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Hinds County Circuit Court, Mississippi, issued a memorandum opinion and order, which granted judgment against appellant Governor of Mississippi, opining that a writ of election issued by the Governor violated the U.S. and Mississippi Constitutions and the statutory laws of the state, and declaring the writ of election was a nullity, being void ab initio. The Governor appealed. Appellee Attorney General of Mississippi cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The writ of election established November 4, 2008, as the date for a special election to fill a vacancy created by a U.S. Senator's resignation. Official notice of the Senator's resignation was received on December 20, 2007. That same day, the Governor issued the writ of execution. The Attorney General alleged that the writ of election violated Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 23-15-855 (Rev. 2007). The instant court concluded that the circuit court erred, as a matter of law, in deeming &sect; 23-15-855 plain, clear, and unambiguous, and then finding the writ of election exceeded the Governor's constitutional and statutory authority. As portions of &sect; 23-15-855 were ambiguous, and others silent, the writ of election, which designated November 4, 2008, as the general election day for electing a Senator to complete the term of office was not constitutionally infirm. Moreover, both the temporary appointment of a replacement Senator and the writ of election effectuated the clear intent of the legislature that no senatorial temporary appointment exceed one year and an election would be held on the date of a general congressional election, less than one year after the temporary appointment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The instant court affirmed the judgment as to the denial of the Attorney General's motion for preliminary injunctive relief and the granting of the Governor's motion to dismiss, or for judgment on the pleadings, as to the Attorney General's request for a writ of mandamus, other remedial writs, or injunctive relief of any kind, and it reversed and rendered as to the declaratory judgment entered against the Governor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial, the State sought to use closed circuit television to present the testimony of minor children to the jury, pursuant to Miss.

Defendant was able to hear the questions and answers, but he could not see the witnesses. Defendant unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial. The jury requested a transcript of the children's testimony, but they were told that it was a live feed only. Defendant was convicted, a motion for a new trial was denied, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court found no violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment confrontation right. Defendant waived the right to claim error in the jury's inability to hear portions of the testimony because his counsel specifically declined to object. Next, the use of closed-circuit testimony was not a violation of the Confrontation Clause. To secure a new trial, defendant was required to show that the denial of his right view the demeanor of the children prejudiced him. An assertion of error without prejudice did not trigger reversal.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-46-1 to 11-46-23 (Rev. 2002). After a decision was rendered on appeal, a motion for rehearing was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the decedent's death in 2000, there was a delay in receiving an autopsy report. Notice was given to the providers in 2002, and a lawsuit was subsequently filed. A motion for summary judgment was granted, and this appeal followed. A decision was rendered in the case on appeal, but the representative filed a motion for a rehearing. It was granted. In reversing the trial court, the supreme court determined that the statute of limitations for claims filed under the MTCA began to run when all of the elements of a tort existed. That was when some damage to the representative proximately resulted from the providers' negligence. Next, the doctrine of stare decisis required the supreme court to recognize a discovery rule for MTCA claims. The statute of limitations under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11 (Rev. 2002) did not begin to run until the representative knew, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, that a cause of action existed. A remand was necessary because this issue was not addressed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A rehearing was granted. The previous opinions in the case were withdrawn, and a new opinion was substituted. The trial court's decision was reversed. The case was remanded for a hearing on the question of whether, within a year of providing notice to the providers, the representative knew or, by exercise of reasonable diligence, should have known of both the decedent's injury and the alleged tortious act or omission which proximately caused it.</SPAN></P>

On the inmate's petition for postconviction relief, the court held that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of the inmate's character and childhood history during the penalty phase of his trial. The inmate contended that if his counsel had investigated, they would have uncovered at least 15 witnesses who could have provided mitigating evidence concerning his childhood, education, drug habits, and other issues related to his character and childhood history. However, the court held that counsel was not ineffective for failing to present evidence of mental impairment as a mitigating factor during the penalty phase because counsel sought a mental evaluation of defendant and attempted to acquire additional testing, but the mental evaluation revealed that the inmate was malingering. This description of the inmate, if used by the State to rebut the inmate's claims of mental problems, could have been damaging in the eyes of the jury, and therefore the decision not use the evaluation was presumed to be strategic.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff wife appealed a judgment of the Franklin County Circuit Court (Mississippi) granting defendants, a hospital and a physician, summary judgment in the wife's medical malpractice action filed under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (MTCA), Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-1 et seq. (Rev. 2002), seeking damages for her husband's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife sued defendants, alleging that they failed to properly treat her husband's septic colon, causing his death. The trial court granted defendants summary judgment on the ground that the wife's action was barred by the MTCA's one-year statute of repose because it was not filed within one year, as required by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11(3). On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that applying &sect; 11-46-11(3) as written, it was clear that the wife failed to commence her action within its one-year limitation, and therefore it was statutorily time-barred. The alleged tortious conduct of defendants occurred, at the latest, on April 17, 2000, the day the husband died. Notice of the claim was not provided to the hospital until February 13, 2002, and was never provided to the physician, and therefore the notice was clearly outside the MTCA's one-year limitation period. The court overruled Barnes v. Singing River Hosp., 733 So. 2d 199, 205 (Miss. 1999), and its progeny, insofar as they judicially amended the MTCA by supplying a discovery rule tolling its one-year statute of repose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 2001, the mayor nominated department directors pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-8-23(2) (Rev. 2007). The council approved the directors. The mayor was reelected and began a second term in 2005. At that time, the mayor indicated he was not going to resubmit the department directors for approval to the council. Three council members sought a writ of mandamus to compel him to comply with what they perceived the law required. The trial court issued the writ. On appeal, the court found that the council members had standing to seek a writ under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-41-1 (Rev. 2002). It was undisputed that the mayor had a duty to nominate, and the council a duty to approve or disapprove, directors of municipal departments. The council members demonstrated that, by virtue of their position as the legislative check and balance on the executive power of the mayor, they had a separate interest or an interest in excess of the general public. Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-8-23(2) required that the mayor resubmit directors for approval by the council at the beginning of the new term of office, even if a director was a holdover from the previous term and had been previously approved by the council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Lafayette County Circuit Court, Mississippi, dismissed appellant partnership's request for a declaratory judgment that H.B. 1671, Reg. Sess. (Miss. 2006), was unconstitutional and granted summary judgment in favor of appellee city. The partnership appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The partnership argued that H.B. 1671 violated Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 87 by suspending multiple general laws for the benefit of a private entity. The supreme court agreed that H.B. 1671 suspended general laws. However, it benefited the city and the benefit to any private party was indirect. Having determined that the aim of H.B. 1671 was to benefit the public by facilitating the construction or acquisition of municipal parking facilities, the special law furthered the same purposes as the general law. The differences between H.B. 1671 and Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-37-23 were primarily procedural and minor, as were the differences between H.B. 1671 and Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;21-37-25. H.B. 1671 strayed too far from the general law of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-17-1 by failing to ensure that the consideration received for the conveyance of municipal property was at least equivalent to fair market value. Rendering Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 31-7-13 inapplicable was improper. Thus, the last sentences of sections 3 and 4 of H.B. 1671 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and rendered as to the grant of summary judgment to the city as to the last sentences of H.B. 1671 sections 3 and 4; the grant of summary judgment as to the remaining portions of H.B. 1671 was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following his arrest, the inmate was indicted for capital murder, rape, and four counts of sexual battery; he pled guilty to all six counts in the indictment. The circuit court found that all four factors required by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101(7) (Rev. 2007) were satisfied, that sufficient aggravating circumstances existed, and that the mitigating circumstances did not outweigh the aggravating circumstances. The death penalty was imposed. The supreme court affirmed, stating that the circuit court judiciously provided the inmate with state-funded investigative assistance in developing mitigation evidence. An order authorizing a criminal defense investigator (CDI) was granted, followed by an order granting additional funds for the CDI. Additionally, the indictment charged a death-penalty eligible offense because an indictment was sufficient without listing aggravating circumstances. Anytime an individual was charged with murder, he was put on notice that the death penalty might result. The submission of the Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101(5)(d) aggravating circumstance was proper because the felony-murder aggravator genuinely narrowed the class of defendants eligible for death.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered that the action against the medical defendants, but not the casino, be transferred from the county of the casino's location to the county of the hospital's location.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">All the parties asserted that the case should not have been severed. The supreme court agreed, holding that severance of a wrongful death action was violative of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-7-13 and was also inconsistent with Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 85-5-7 (1999). The trial court did not err in transferring the medical defendants to the county where the hospital was located because under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-11-3(3) (2004), the only proper venue for a suit against medical providers was the county in which the alleged act or omission occurred. The presence of medical providers in the action rendered inapplicable Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-11-3(1)(a)(i) (2004), which more generally provided that an action was to be commenced where a substantial event that caused the injury occurred. Similarly, there was no conflict between Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-11-3(3) and the more liberal venue provision of Miss. R. Civ. P. 82(c). However, it was error not to order the casino to the county of the hospital's location along with the medical defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed the trial court's severance order and its denial of reconsideration, and the case was remanded to the trial court with directions to transfer the entire case to the circuit court of the county of the hospital's location for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed the driver's conviction. Both defendant and the State filed petitions for writ of certiorari, which were granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the indictment was legally insufficient, and his conviction had to be reversed. The supreme court found defendant's indictment to be no more informative than a hypothetical indictment which charged a defendant with entering a conspiracy to commit &quot;some unlawful activity.&quot; The language of Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;97-23-101(3)(a) (Rev. 2006) required that an underlying crime be named in the indictment of a state money laundering charge. However, based on the civil forfeiture action which was filed prior to defendant's indictment, he was clearly informed that the sheriff's department deemed this money the proceeds of drug trafficking activities. The omission of the &quot;specified unlawful activity&quot; in the indictment was harmless error which did not render the trial fundamentally unfair. The defense had ample notice that the charge of money laundering was based on the State's claim that the money was the product of drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that: (1) although the aggravating circumstances which invoked the death penalty were not charged in the indictment, the fact that the capital murder statute listed the possible aggravating circumstances refuted the contention that petitioner had inadequate notice; (2) because the record supported no findings of error, there could be no prejudicial cumulative error; (3) use of the underlying felony as an aggravating sentencing factor did not constitute double prejudice; and (4) other issues raised on direct appeal could not be considered on collateral appeal under Miss.

That provision required a justice court judge to have resided two years in the county next proceeding the judge's selection. The legislature had no authority to change the requirements for those seeking the office of justice court judge. The Mississippi Constitution was detailed in setting forth the requirements for candidates for justice court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's death sentence had been previously vacated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A federal court vacated defendant's sentence of death for a capital murder and remanded the case with instructions to return to the state court for reconsideration of the death sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both sides presented expert testimony and other evidence regarding defendant's mental retardation claim. After hearing all the evidence, which was substantial, the trial judge outlined the evidence that he had considered and gave his reasons for concluding that defendant was not mentally retarded. One doctor testified that defendant did not test retarded on his intelligence quotient tests. Also, an officer testified that he saw defendant write certain documents without assistance, which one doctor opined would not have been possible for a mentally retarded person to do alone. Accordingly, based on the evidence, the trial court did not err in finding that defendant was not mentally retarded. Thus, his death sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment, which prohibited the execution of mentally retarded inmates. Additionally, the supreme court found that defendant's death sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. Furthermore, there were other factually similar cases where the death sentence was imposed. Thus, the death sentence was neither excessive or disproportionate under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-105(3).</SPAN></P>

It affirmed the decision to grant the CON, and the hospital sought further review. In affirming, the supreme court determined that, without listing a single exception or qualification, &sect; 41-7-191(16) clearly mandated the issuance of the CON. Next, the hospital was unable to raise challenges to the statute based on Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 87, Miss. Const.&nbsp;art. 3, &sect; 14, and the Fourteenth Amendment. It did not comply with the service requirements of Miss. R. Civ. P. 24(d) or Miss. R. App. P. 44(a). Notice to the special assistant attorney general was insufficient in this case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the Madison County Circuit Court (Mississippi) found defendant guilty of five counts of photographing a person in privacy without permission under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-29-63 (Rev. 2006). Defendant filed a motion for a new trial and/or a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), which the trial court denied. He timely filed an appeal to the supreme court seeking reversal of that denial and of the jury verdict of guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The undisputed facts were that defendant recorded the victim starting around 9:00 at night, sitting inside his vehicle, the interior of which was dark, about 87 feet away from the victim's apartment, using a camera and its zoom feature and carrying in his vehicle two sets of binoculars. The time of day, dark location, distance from the victim's apartment, and equipment for producing close-up recordings from such a distance clearly indicated an attempt by defendant to conceal his actions and elude observation or detection. Therefore, the facts showed that defendant acted secretly in recording the victim in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-29-63 (Rev. 2006). Also, without question, proof that defendant recorded the victim while she was in her apartment was equivalent to proving that she was recorded while in her private dwelling in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-29-63 (Rev. 2006). Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction under the &quot;video voyeur&quot; statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-29-63 (Rev. 2006). Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for directed verdict, JNOV, or a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While troubled by the lack of substantial evidence against defendant, the supreme court could not find that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for a new trial. However, the supreme court did find independent, reversible error in the trial court's failure to adhere to Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; Cty. R. 9.04(I) in excluding the statement of the State's key witness taken by defendant's investigator. Another independent factor requiring reversal was defense counsel's failure to investigate substantial mitigating factors during sentencing. There were also other, cumulative errors that provided further justification for reversal including the State maintaining in closing argument that defendant had been seen at the crime scene when he had not, defense counsel's failure to explore the possible tainting of the venire panel, and the exclusion of the State's ballistics report from evidence. These errors were of particular concern because much of the State's case against defendant, absent the inconsistent testimony of its key witness, was indirect. In sum, the independent and cumulative errors during both the guilt and sentencing phases deprived defendant of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed defendant's conviction and sentence and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner's trial counsel also served as appellate counsel; thus, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not procedurally barred pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 99-39-21(1) and 99-39-21(3) (2000) as it was unrealistic to expect an attorney to preserve an ineffective assistance claim as to his own performance. In addition, petitioner was entitled to a hearing on the matter as counsel's untimely disclosure of some mitigation witnesses led to their exclusion from the sentencing phase of the trial, which the trial court even characterized as ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, counsel failed to pursue petitioner's mental retardation claim and to offer sufficient mitigating evidence. Petitioner's claims concerning cruel and unusual punishment just by being placed on death row and the alleged improper admission of photographs were procedurally barred by &sect; 99-39-21 as they could have been raised on direct appeal. Petitioner was, however, entitled to a hearing on whether he was mentally retarded and, therefore, not competent to be executed based on the Eighth Amendment. Petitioner's IQ fell within the mildly retarded range, and further testing was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the application as to the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and cruel and unusual punishment insofar as that claim related to his alleged mental retardation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim's sister testified that she answered the doorbell to find a person she did not know inquiring about her brother. Not knowing that his sister had already answered the door, the victim appeared. The stranger at the door pulled out a gun and started shooting. The sister immediately picked out the photograph of defendant as being the person who shot her brother. At trial, the sister also identified defendant as the shooter. On review, defendant requested that the supreme court reverse his conviction and discharge him, not only for the violation of the Sixth Amendment or state constitutional rights under Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 26 (1890), but also for a perceived violation of Mississippi's speedy trial statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-17-1. The supreme court concluded that when the record was read in its totality, it was obvious that even the day of trial, defendant did not want a speedy trial. What defendant had demanded was a dismissal of the charge based on an alleged violation of his speedy trial rights, but defendant failed to demand a speedy trial. Moreover, part of the delay in this case was created by defendant's refusal to cooperate with his court-appointed counsel.</SPAN></P>

Those issues included prosecutorial misconduct, the introduction of prior bad acts, and jury instructions. Some claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were also barred by res judicata, but the court considered the claims in which the inmate introduced new extraneous materials. The claims were without merit. Evidence of his counsel's drug use and illness did not change the court's finding on direct appeal that the attorney provided effective assistance of counsel. The ex-girlfriend's unfair or manipulative conduct towards the inmate did not change the fact that he broke into her house and killed her brother. Even if counsel had been able to produce psychological evaluations at the time of trial, the evaluations were not that compelling, particularly in the context of a death penalty case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court rejected defendant's ex post facto argument as the Mississippi statute was a civil, nonpunitive regulatory scheme. However, the claim that he lacked notice of the registration requirement, which resulted in a denial of his constitutional right to due process, had merit under federal precedent. Although ignorance of the law was generally not an excuse, in order to sustain a conviction under the applicable federal precedent, the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the State had proved that defendant had actual knowledge of the duty to register, or that the State had proved the probability of such knowledge. Since the issue of whether defendant had actual or probable knowledge of the duty to register as a sex offender was a factual issue for the jury to decide, the trial court had erred in refusing defendant's request for jury instruction requiring notice. The trial court had not improperly determined facts giving rise to defendant's lifetime habitual status where the post jury verdict hearing was relegated to proof regarding prior convictions for four separate felonies to which defendant had pled guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Jackson County Circuit Court, Mississippi, dismissed appellant's motion for post-conviction relief for lack of jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court found that the circuit court's interpretation of Miss.

Because appellant's petition was filed under the Mississippi Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;99-39-1 to 27 (Supp. 2005), the circuit court erred in finding that it did not have jurisdiction and dismissing the petition. The circuit judge who ordered appellant to complete the Regimented Inmate Discipline program and then report back for possible alteration of the terms of the sentence intended that appellant should not be required to serve the remainder of his sentence as an inmate in a state penitentiary. The supreme court could not determine if, under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(1)(g), appellant's release was unlawfully revoked. Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-47(2)(a) was not relevant to the issues at hand, and both the circuit court and court of appeals erred when they applied this statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a hospital and a doctor, appealed an interlocutory order of the Circuit Court for the First Judicial District of Hinds County (Mississippi), which refused to dismiss a medical malpractice case brought by plaintiff as a result of the death of plaintiff's daughter. Defendants had filed a motion to dismiss or alternatively a motion for summary judgment. Pending before the court was plaintiff's motion for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants claimed that dismissal was proper because plaintiff failed to comply with the notice provisions of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-36(15). On review, the court reversed the trial court's order and rendered judgment in favor of defendants. In considering the plain language of &sect; 15-1-36(15), the court found that plaintiff wholly failed to provide any written notice to any medical provider concerning her intention to commence suit. Thus, the trial court erred in denying defendants' motion to dismiss defendants' motion. The court did not address the issue of the constitutionality of the statute because the issue was not raised on appeal. Although plaintiff had the constitutional right to seek redress in the state courts for the death of her daughter, she also had the responsibility to comply with &sect; 15-1-36(15). Therefore, as a matter of law, defendants were entitled to dismissal of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied plaintiff's motion for rehearing, withdrew its original opinion, and substituted the present opinion. The court reversed the trial court's order denying the defendants' motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment, and rendered judgment in favor of defendants, dismissing plaintiff's second amendment complaint and the present action without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

A limited liability company such as existed between defendant and her partner was not encompassed within the language of &sect; 97-23-19 providing for a felony conviction upon embezzlement of certain therein described property belonging to an incorporated company or a private person. Therefore, the State did not present legally sufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict against defendant on each and every element of the crime of embezzlement as set out in &sect; 97-23-19.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted for shooting the four victims to death. On the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief, the court held that defense counsel's decision not to seek a change of venue was beyond its review. The inmate was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to transcribe the full record because the inmate did not claim any specific error arising from the non-transcribed sections of the record. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence at sentencing because it was the inmate's choice not to do so; the inmate was fully apprised of the consequences of his choice and he made an informed and voluntary decision not to presenting mitigating evidence. The inmate's claim that the use of the robbery aggravating factor during sentencing was inappropriate as it allowed the use of the underlying felony, which elevated the crime to capital murder, was procedurally barred under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21(1) because it could have been raised on direct appeal and was not. The inmate's claim that the use of the avoiding arrest aggravating factor without a limiting instruction was unconstitutional was also procedurally barred.</SPAN></P>

In addition to finding that the issue was procedurally barred, the supreme court found the issue to be without merit. The State called a forensic pathologist, who testified that the victim suffered defensive wounds on both arms as well as her right leg. The applicant offered an affidavit of a forensic dentist who asserted that the positioning of the victim's body was &quot;staged&quot; by the perpetrator for some reason other than attempted rape. The dentist was also a licensed attorney in California and a certified senior crime scene analyst. Likewise, the dentist had been the Deputy Medical Examiner for the Ventura County Coroner's Office since 1988. He had testified as an expert in the field of forensic dentistry in several states and additionally, he had published articles and textbooks on forensic dental evidence. It was doubtful that expert testimony regarding the positioning of the body would have likely resulted in a different verdict. The victim was found nude from the waist down with her shorts and underwear bunched at one ankle, as well as with five gunshot wounds to her head.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that the State failed to meet its burden to prove that the artificial accretions above the mean high water line were not done pursuant to a constitutional legislative enactment and for a higher public purpose. Therefore, a hearing was warranted to determine the mean high water line nearest the effective date of the Coastal Wetlands Protection Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 49-27-1, et seq. Appellants' predecessor's 1928 public land patent from the State was at a time when the property at issue was being utilized, albeit by a private company, to promote the State's booming oyster industry. The chancellor erred in finding that the conveyance by the State to a predecessor of appellants was null and void for want of authority because the evidence revealed a 1943 deed to the patented area.</SPAN></P>

The trial court properly denied defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because there was legally sufficient evidence for the trial court to find defendant guilty of DUI. It was established that defendant had a breath-alcohol content of 0.13 percent through the testimony of an officer, a printout from a completed intoxilyzer test, and a uniform traffic ticket. A second officer testified that the field sobriety test was given on the basis of the smell of an intoxicating beverage on defendant's breath.

The city had filed a petition for condemnation after the utility land was annexed into the city and the parties failed to agree upon the value of the utility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The utility challenged the city's evidence, arguing that it was improperly based on data from the Public Service Commission (PSC) used to set rates and did not include the value of &quot;contributed property&quot; from land developers. The city challenged the value determination and the award of interest. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to strike the city's expert's testimony because &quot;contributed property&quot; must be included in the utility's value for condemnation purposes even though such items were not included for purposes of rate-regulation. Also the trial court erred by excluding the utility's evidence as to the value of 4 parcels of land without improvements because the value of the land upon which the utility was built should have been considered as one factor in determining just compensation. The court found that the trial court erred when it compounded the interest and made a distinction between pre- and post-judgment interest because Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-27-19 was the specific eminent domain provision for interest and eminent domain judgments were not based on notes, accounts, sales or contracts; therefore Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 75-17-1(1) and 75-17-7 did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The inmate was convicted and given the death penalty. After the conviction and sentence were affirmed, the inmate sought postconviction relief. In denying such, the supreme court determined that there were no due process violations under Brady since defendant received all exculpatory evidence. Next, defendant's Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was not violated either. The decision to move for a change of venue was merely trial strategy. Moreover, the failure to discover perjured testimony and the failure to call witnesses for an alibi did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. Even though the failure to call an expert regarding the bite marks was deficient, there was no prejudice shown because the inmate did not show that he did not bite the victim. Moreover, the inmate was not entitled to formal notice of the aggravating factors used by the prosecution. Also, the circuit court did not err by denying discovery under Miss. R. App. 22 because the inmate failed to show that it was not frivolous or how it would have helped in the preparation of specific postconviction relief issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Pike County Circuit Court (Mississippi), of capital murder of a child while engaged in the commission of felonious child abuse the murder of his stepson, who was the child's father, and the murder of the stepson's wife under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19. Defendant was sentenced to death on the child's murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant took the victims to his cabin and left them there. Over a month later, the victims' bodies were found. The court found that testimony admitted regarding an insurance scam with defendant was properly admitted under Miss. R. Evid. 403, 404(b), and 804(b)(5) because the declarant was unavailable and because the trial court analyzed the five requirements for admission of the hearsay. Further, defendant's confrontation rights were found not violated under U.S. Const. amend. VI or Miss. Const. art. III, &sect; 26 in the Crawford did not apply because the statements were not testimonial hearsay. Testimony of defendant's prior bad acts was not objected to and thus any errors were procedurally barred and the trial court was not required to sua sponte give a limiting instruction on the evidence. Several other issues were procedurally barred because defendant failed to object. The jury instruction defining child abuse was proper because it tracked the language of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-5-39(2)(a). However, the trial court did not, as required, instruct the jury as to the option of life without parole as provided in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment as to the convictions and to the life sentences for the two murder convictions. The court reversed and remanded for resentencing on the capital murder charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a medical malpractice suit, appellant physician and appellant hospital moved to dismiss the action due to appellee executrix's failure to give the required statutory notice. The Hinds County Circuit Court, Mississippi, denied the motion. The physician and the hospital sought interlocutory appeal, which was granted under Miss. R. App. P. 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient, who was the executrix's daughter, was seen and evaluated in the hospital's emergency room. Nevertheless, the patient died. The hospital and the physician framed the issues in this way: (1) Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-36(15) (Rev. 2003) required a 60-day notice of the intention to bring a medical malpractice suit; therefore, did noncompliance with the notice provisions require dismissal? (2) Was the action now time-barred? (3) Should leave to amend have been denied because the statute required dismissal? The executrix in the case wholly failed to provide written notice to any medical provider. Under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-36(1) (Rev. 2003), the executrix had two years from the date of the alleged negligent act in which to commence the lawsuit against medical providers. The trial court erred in denying the motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment. The supreme court noted that in applying the statute requiring notice, the executrix was not deprived of any constitutional right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed the trial court's judgment, and it rendered judgment in favor of the physician and the hospital.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the State of Mississippi, its fiscal officer, and attorney general, sought review of an order from the Coahoma County Chancery Court (Mississippi), which entered summary judgment in favor of appellee board of levee commissioners and declared H.B. 1279, &sect; 7(4) (Miss. 2004) (bill), requiring the board to transfer funds to the State, unconstitutional and granted an injunction to prevent its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board argued, among other things, that the bill was unconstitutional because it violated Miss. Const. art. XI, &sect; 227 et seq. in that the legislature did not have the authority to require the transfer of board funds for use in a state budget contingency fund. In affirming, the court agreed, and held that the bill, in authorizing the use of board funds for non-levee purposes, plainly conflicted with the clear language of Miss. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 232 and 236 and was, therefore, unconstitutional. Noting that Miss. Const. art. XI, &sect; 232 gave the board plenary authority to deal with the erection, maintenance, and repair of the levee system, the court first found that, although the board was subject to legislative control absent constitutional provision otherwise, the framers did not grant legislative authority to frustrate the purposes of any constitutionally-created organization. Next, the court found that, because the bill required board funds be converted to the budget contingency fund for use other than levee purposes, the legislature overstepped the limitation set forth in Miss. Const. art. XI, &sect; 236, which expressly prohibited the use of board funds for non-levee purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the bill was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a case brought by plaintiffs, a home builders association and others, challenging defendant city's adoption of development impact fees for various municipal improvements, services, equipment, and vehicles, the Jackson County Circuit Court, Mississippi, held the fees to be a void taxing measure and enjoined further collection of the fees. The city appealed the ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The impact fees were to be paid in addition to any and all other applicable land-use, zoning, planning, adequate public facilities, platting, or other related fees, requirements, standards, and conditions imposed by the city. The court concluded that the impact fees constituted a tax that the city had no authority to assess. The fees did not qualify as regulatory in nature because no special benefit was conferred on the fee payer. The fees did not cover administrative expenses incurred by the city because the fees were not based on the administrative expense the city incurred in issuing a building permit. The fees constituted a tax because the fees were simply a revenue-raising measure. Because the fees constituted a tax, the city was required to have enabling legislation in order to levy and collect the tax. The state's municipal planning statutes,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 17-1-1 et seq., did not grant the city authority to adopt impact fees or other revenue raising mechanisms to implement its comprehensive plan. The home rule statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-17-5, did not authorize the city to impose a tax unless such tax was specifically authorized by another statute or state law.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. Defendant informed the trial court that he disagreed with the factual basis for the plea. Defense counsel clarified that defendant would &quot;admit he shook the baby, but not that he threw him to the floor.&quot; The State objected, asserting that the head injury - the cause of death - did not come from the shaking but rather from blunt force trauma. When the trial court attempted to resolve the discrepancy, defendant maintained that he found the child on the floor not breathing, and all he did was pick him up and shake him to get him to start breathing. The trial court's refusal to accept the guilty plea was not error. Defendant refused to admit that he inflicted the blunt force head trauma that caused his son's death. Considering defendant's limited admission together with the pre-trial documentary evidence, the trial court properly determined that defendant failed to admit sufficient facts to justify heat of passion manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 27-73-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Mississippi Tax Commission assessed the taxpayers with additional income tax, penalties, and interest for the tax years 1990 to 1995. The taxpayers failed to file an appeal from the order. Over two years later, they filed a refund claim under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-73-1. The request was denied, and the chancery court granted summary judgment to the attorney general and the DFA in a subsequent judicial action. The taxpayers then sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The taxpayers had 30 days to appeal under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-7-73 (repealed 2005) after the procedures in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-7-71 (repealed 2005) were utilized. When they failed to do so, the determination became a final adjudication. The doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel barred any further action. This precluded the taxpayers from subsequently seeking relief under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-73-1. Even if such an action was permissible, it would have been time barred under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-73-5. Finally, the appellate court was not required to consider the constitutional arguments.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge made the parties equally responsible for the balances of the existing medical bills and required them to split all future medical bills for the child. The trial judge ordered the father to reimburse the mother for her attorney fees. On appeal, the mother claimed that the trial court erred in not making the father responsible for the full amount of the child's medical expenses. The court found that the trial judge did not declare Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-9-7&nbsp;unconstitutional. The trial judge merely stated that an inaccurate interpretation of the statute making the father solely responsible for all of the child's medical expenses would violate equal protection laws. The trial judge made a permissible division of the financial responsibility for medical expenses. As to the award of attorney fees pursuant to Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Washington County Circuit Court, Mississippi, granted appellee's, State of Mississippi, motion to dismiss appellant business owner's suit to challenge the constitutionality of the criminal statutes under which he was arrested and under which the gambling machines and money were seized. The trial court found that the machines were illegal gambling devices, and that the owner had no property rights in the contraband. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner challenged the constitutionality of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-33-7, and Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-33-17. The owner claimed he was deprived of a property right in the machines, and profits from the machines, without a hearing to determine if his machines were covered by the statute or if the seizure was valid. The supreme court noted that illegal gambling machines were those that were operated by coin, token, or other consideration, and dispensed a product with the possibility of dispensing additional items at varying quantities. The U.S. Constitution applied to every statute. The owner did not meet his burden of showing that he was being deprived of his property without due process of law because the criminal statutes,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-33-7, -17, were not too broad in their description of what caused a video game to be an illegal slot machine. A person with ordinary intelligence would have little difficulty determining what exactly was prohibited. Mississippi did not extend a property right to illegal gambling machines. There was no due process rights violation and Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-33-7(2) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury for the Adams County Circuit Court (Mississippi) found defendant guilty of capital murder (murder during the commission of a sexual battery) of the six-month old victim, the same jury found that he should suffer the penalty of death. Consistent with the jury verdict, the trial court imposed the death sentence upon defendant, and it was from that final judgment that defendant appealed to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a videotaped statement two days after the victim's death, defendant denied committing sexual battery on her, but instead claimed he accidentally dropped her against the commode after bathing her, shook her in a panic, and then rubbed her down with lavender lotion before putting her to bed. Defendant argued that his representation was ineffective at several points during the trial, violating his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel. But, the supreme court found that his counsel was not ineffective because (1) a potential juror made no indication during the extensive questioning following her objectionable comments that in any way revealed she would be unable to be fair and impartial in deciding whether defendant was guilty or not guilty, and if found guilty, in deciding the appropriate sentence; (2) the trial judge asked if any potential juror would automatically vote for or against the death penalty and, thus, defense counsel was not ineffective in failing to repeat that line of questioning; and (3) given the testimony provided in mitigation of punishment and what it did show the jury about defendant's life and tendencies, counsel's performance was not deficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the George County Circuit Court (Mississippi) of capital murder and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because the evidence was insufficient to sustain the underlying robbery conviction. The supreme court disagreed. Defendant elicited testimony from the owner of a convenience store in Jackson County which defendant and the victim frequented, stating that he had observed at times previous to the murder defendant driving the victim's truck alone. Defendant was attempting to prove that the victim allowed him to borrow the truck and thus he had permission to drive the truck the day he was caught in Jackson County. However, officers discovered defendant in possession of the victim's truck and a sword taken from the victim's trailer. Possession of the victim's property created a reasonable inference that the property was stolen. Therefore, a reasonable juror could have determined that defendant stole the victim's property. In addition to his possession of the property, there was testimony that defendant admitted that the truck was stolen. Accordingly, there was enough legally sufficient evidence to determine that defendant robbed the victim and to convict defendant of capital murder.</SPAN></P>
