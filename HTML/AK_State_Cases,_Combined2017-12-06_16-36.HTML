<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an appeal concerning an initiative proposed by appellant citizens, the municipal clerk rejected the initiative petition on the advice of the municipal attorney, who maintained that it would constitute an impermissible appropriation. The citizens appealed the clerk's action to the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage. The superior court granted judgment to appellee municipality. The citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality owned several hundred undeveloped acres in the lower end of the valley. The citizens submitted their initiative petition to the municipal clerk for certification in accordance with Anchorage, Alaska, Mun. Code 2.05.050. The clerk refused to certify the petition, relying on an opinion letter from the municipal attorney, which advised that the petition was legally insufficient because it proposed an appropriation. The initiative designated the use of specified amounts of public assets in a way that encroached on the legislative branch's exclusive control over the allocation of state assets among competing needs. Also, the initiative intruded on decisions reserved by statute and constitution to the assembly by making an appropriation. Thus, the clerk was correct to refuse to place the initiative on the ballot because the clerk was acting within her authority when she rejected the initiative on the ground that it proposed to make an appropriation, which was an action that could not be taken by initiative. Without the impermissible park designation, the rest of the initiative could not go to the voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the State and the Commissioner of Fish and Game, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which held that a regulation promulgated by the Alaska Joint Boards of Fisheries and Game was invalid because it did not satisfy Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.258(c). Cross-appellant, an Indian tribe, challenged the part of the order that upheld a nonsubsistence area classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.258, the joint boards heard public testimony from affected tribe members and considered evidence submitted by the tribes and reports from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The joint boards then adopted Alaska Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 99.015, which established five nonsubsistence areas in the state. The court held that the boundaries chosen by the joint boards as a starting point were not improper, even though they encompassed relatively large areas. Given the similarity of the rural criteria and the subsistence criteria, the joint boards did not exceed their discretion in using the non-rural boundaries as starting points for their nonsubsistence determinations. There was no constitutional preference for a subsistence or nonsubsistence starting point for any given community. The joint boards only had to consider the relative importance of subsistence in the context of the totality of the socio-economic criteria. The court concluded that the joint boards gave a hard look at the evidence presented and that the regulation was not invalid for failing to designate the Kenai Peninsula as a subsistence area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the superior court, thus reinstating the disputed regulation. The court affirmed the summary judgment that declared valid the inclusion of the Kenai Peninsula in the nonsubsistence area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state legislative council challenged a decision of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, First Judicial District, which denied the council's challenge to appellee governor's veto of a particular Senate bill and granted the governor summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Senate bill at issue transferred land and income derived from that land to a state university. The governor vetoed the bill. The council challenged the governor's veto, but the trial court found that the bill constituted an appropriation subject to the governor's enhanced veto power requiring a three-fourths vote by the legislature in order to override the veto under Alaska Const. art. II, &sect; 16. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that non-monetary asset transfers were not appropriations subject to the governor's enhanced veto under the Alaska Constitution. The minutes of the state constitution convention and Alaska Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 2, 9, 12, art. IX, &sect;&sect; 12, 16 mandated an exclusively monetary concept of appropriations, and thus only monetary asset transfers constituted appropriations. Therefore, the Senate bill's transfer of land to the university was not subject to the governor's enhanced appropriations veto. The bill did not provide the university with a sufficiently definite sum of money to have constituted an appropriation. The court declined to address whether the bill was an unconstitutional dedication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District at Anchorage, affirmed the order of the municipality's zoning board of examiners and appeals, which had affirmed the enforcement order of appellee, the Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska, Land Use Division, directing appellant property owner to stop using the area surrounding his four-plex as a storage yard for cars. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner owned a four-plex in a neighborhood zoned as an R-3 multiple-family residential district. The property owner collected cars as a hobby and regularly kept 20 or more cars on his property and in the adjoining right of way. In response to complaints, a municipality safety division concluded that the property owner was using his property as a storage yard, in violation of the ordinances governing permissible R-3 property uses. The appellate court was convinced that abundant evidence supported the conclusion that the property owner's car collection exceeded the type of relatively minor, customarily accepted, incidental use that an objectively reasonable resident would consider to be compatible with an R-3 district's primarily residential character. But, the appellate court would not approve the enforcement order because, with no prior zoning decisions delineating community standards for car storage as an accessory use in R-3 districts, the board's failure to approve findings left the property owner with inadequate notice to form a clear understanding of the action the municipality expected him to take to avoid sanctions for non-compliance with the enforcement order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the decision that the property owner's collection of cars exceeded the scope of a permissible accessory use of his zoned R-3 property. However, the appellate court remanded the case to the board for entry of specific findings regarding reasonable notice of the steps the property owner needed to complete to correct his zoning violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving a punitive damages award based on wrongful discharge and defamation claims, appellant worker sought to have Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.17.020(j) held unconstitutional. Cross-appellant State intervened, asserting its statutory right to 50 percent of the worker's punitive damages. The Alaska Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, found in the State's favor as to the award, but not attorney's fees. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the worker contended that Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.17.020(j) was unconstitutional as it applied to the instant case; the State contended that Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.60.080 only governed the calculation of the worker's attorney's fees and that the State was entitled to 50 percent of the punitive damages award before fees were deducted. The supreme court held in a split decision that because whether a claim was &quot;property&quot; was defined by the laws in existence when the claim arose, it followed that the worker's claim for punitive damages could be protected property only insofar as permitted by Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.17.020(j). Thus, the allocation of 50 percent to the state was not an unconstitutional taking. The supreme court unanimously held that the trial court was correct in determining that the State's half of the punitive award was subject to a corresponding reduction to pay a portion of the worker's attorney's contingent fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant knew the couple for over 30 years and lived with them while his girlfriend was pregnant. When appellant and his girlfriend separated, they engaged in a child custody dispute. After appellant's separation from his girlfriend, the relationship between appellant and the couple deteriorated. The couple became involved in the custody dispute. The couple testified and made statements to a court-appointed custody investigator. Appellant sued the couple for defamation based on their statements during the custody proceedings and during a protective order proceeding. The superior court ruled that appellant's claim failed as a matter of law and also ordered him to pay the couple attorney's fees. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defamatory testimony by a witness in a judicial proceeding, which was pertinent to the matter under inquiry, was absolutely privileged. Additionally, the court declined to rule on appellant's claim that the award of attorney's fees was unconstitutional because it placed a deterrent on his right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

The municipality denied some permits and some certificates based on the owners failure to comply with plat and plot notes. The company challenged conditions the municipality imposed on the issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy for certain homes. The appellate court found that the municipality had the authority to enforce the plat notes and plot notes against the company. Additionally, the municipality did not have to issue building permits or certificates of occupancy as long as the requirements listed on the plat notes were unfulfilled. Furthermore, because the municipality did not have a mandatory duty to issue the company unconditioned permits and certificates, it could not establish a substantive due process violation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was not entitled to dismissal only for good cause. Being told that permanent employment was contingent upon his successful performance in the position amounted to no more than a description of the function of the probationary period and did not convert his employment from at-will into one for which he could only be dismissed for cause. The employee's good faith and fair dealing claims depended on his presenting genuine issues of several material facts, which he failed to do. There was no admissible evidence implying that he had been hired as a &quot;stopgap&quot; to meet transportation needs until the State's private contractor bidding process was complete. No genuine dispute existed as to the State's intentions when it hired him. There was no admissible evidence implying that he was dismissed for any reason other than poor job performance or that he was hired or fired for an improper reason. Finally, he did not present admissible evidence creating a genuine issues of fact about whether his job was eliminated through impermissible contracting, and summary judgment was properly entered on his claim for breach of the collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>

The resident filed an action seeking an injunction requiring the clerk to prepare the petition and place it on the ballot. The trial court granted summary judgment to the resident. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision that the application should not have been rejected. The court held that the clerk could only reject an initiative application under &sect; 29.26.110(a), if the constitutionality of the proposed issue had already been determined against the resident's position. The issue of mayoral term limits had not been addressed in relation to citizens' rights to vote and to run for office. The initiative's language was technically flawed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent retirees brought lawsuits against petitioner State, alleging that changes made to the State's group health insurance plan for retired public employees in 1999 and 2000 violated Alaska Const. art. XII, &sect; 7 by diminishing accrued benefits. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, granted the retirees' summary judgment motion and denied the State's motion. The State sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to change the retirees' group health insurance by providing certain additional benefits, which included an increase in the lifetime annual maximum payment, and agreeing to cover 100 percent of those expenses not covered by Medicare, but also increased the deductible to $ 150 per year, eliminated a provision that waived the deductible once a certain level was reached, and changed the prescription drug coverage. The trial court granted the retirees' summary judgment motion and held that the changes made violated Alaska Const. art. XII, &sect; 7. The state supreme court affirmed the trial court in holding that health insurance benefits were included in the term &quot;accrued benefits,&quot; as contained in article XII, &sect; 7. The state supreme court vacated the grant of the retirees' summary judgment to the extent that it required the analysis of the disadvantages and compensating advantages of changes to health insurance be made by focusing on individuals, as opposed to the entire group of employees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retirees' summary judgment was affirmed, insofar as it held that health insurance benefits were benefits protected by the state constitution, but it was reversed, insofar as it held that the comparative analysis of the disadvantages and compensating advantages of changes to health insurance was to be made by focusing on individuals. The changes did not violate the state constitution, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A federal district court granted summary judgment to plaintiff applicants in an action against defendant North Slope Borough (Alaska), alleging that a borough hiring preference violated state and federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection, the Alaska Human Rights Act, federal civil rights laws, and the borough's charter. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit certified a question for the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants, non-Native Americans, claimed that they were passed over for borough employment by lower ranked Native American applicants, pursuant to North Slope Borough, Alaska, Charter &sect; 16.020. The borough claimed a legitimate interest in remedying severe underemployment in the borough's Native American people and obtained an opinion from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that the charter provision fit within &sect; 703(i) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e-2(i). The court disagreed, holding that the borough had no legitimate basis to claim a general governmental interest in enacting hiring preferences favoring one class of citizens over others and noting that the charter provision in one place singled out Inupiat Eskimos to benefit from it, but that group was not defined anywhere as requiring tribal membership or other arguably political status. The court further noted that &sect; 703(i) did not actively create an employer interest. Even if the provision's basis were legitimate, nevertheless it violated the equal protection provision of the Alaska Constitution, as it was not narrowly tailored to meet its purpose.</SPAN></P>

Laws 130 violated the prohibition of funds found in Alaska Const. art. IX, &sect; 7. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge ruled that 2000 Alaska Sess. Laws 130 was constitutional, and that reducing the settlement to present value and selling it for a lump sum did not violate the anti-dedication clause, Alaska Const. art. IX, &sect; 7. The taxpayer argued that the sale of the future revenue stream from the tobacco settlement violated the constitutional prohibition against dedicating a source of state revenue to any special purpose. The appellate court found that the legislature had some power to manage the state's assets and to appropriate those proceeds even though such actions may conflict with the purposes of the anti-dedication clause. The sale of the tobacco settlement was constitutional because lawsuit settlements were not traditional sources of significant state revenue; periodic payments instead of a lump sum was a matter of fortuity; settlements were more closely comparable to state assets than to taxes; and the legislature had to be allowed to manage state assets so as to control risk. Because the tobacco securitization corporation's bonds were secured solely by the tobacco settlement revenues, the bonds were expressly permitted under Alaska Const. art. IX, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the appellate court found that the trial court properly excluded general government expenditures and forgone revenues from fishing from the calculation; however, the trial court might have improperly excluded the hatcheries loan fund subsidy and some capital costs from the calculation. Furthermore, the appellate court found that the State waived its objection to the protest and notice requirement of Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.10.210(a), as well as a related sovereign immunity claim. In addition, the trial court properly found that any refund would apply to named and unnamed class members.

The employee claimed that the Board's procedures denied him due process and that the Board's factual and legal conclusions were wrong. The supreme court found that requiring the employee to persuade five of the seven sitting board members did not deny him due process and that the employee was not entitled to occupational disability benefits until a five-member majority of the Board decided that he was. Furthermore, one doctor found that the employee's disease was the result of a number of well-recognized, but non-industrial, risk factors and that job-related stress did not contribute to the employee's disability. A second doctor concluded that the employee's angina pectoris and angioplasty were in no way related to his employment. Thus, substantial evidence supported the Board's decision that the employee failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his disability was work related.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The center argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in allowing special damages for rearing the child because the &quot;extraordinary&quot; costs a developmentally disabled woman would incur in raising a healthy child were not the product of the center's negligence. The mother sought only &quot;extraordinary&quot; damages, as opposed to ordinary expenses of raising the child. The mother offered the testimony of a rehabilitation nurse and vocational specialist who presented a &quot;life care plan&quot; segregating the ordinary costs of raising the child from the unique costs the patient would incur as a result of her disabilities, including the cost of special parenting skills training and counseling for the patient to deal with the stress of being a parent. Developmentally disabled women were unlikely to make child-bearing and child-rearing decisions based on the possibility that they might recover extraordinary costs should they file suit -- especially because they would still be responsible for all ordinary child-rearing expenses. The sort of costs awarded could be segregated and distinguished from ordinary costs, and there was little fear of the systemic cost-shifting the center envisioned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city cited appellant property owner for violating Anchorage, Alaska, Municipal Code &sect; 10.40.050 (1994) by advertising for adult-oriented establishments that he was not licensed to operate or maintain. The owner argued that &sect; 10.40.050 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him. A hearing officer and the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, ruled against him. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner leased his properties to third persons who obtained the proper licenses and operated adult-oriented businesses. He claimed that &sect; 10.40.050 unconstitutionally impaired his rights of free speech. He also claimed that because he had provided telephone service and advertising to the leased businesses before &sect; 10.40.050 was adopted, he had &quot;grandfather rights&quot; to continue. The appellate court disagreed. The owner had no right to pursue a preexisting &quot;nonconforming use&quot; under Anchorage, Alaska, Municipal Code &sect; 21.55.030, as that section protected only nonconforming uses of land. There was no compensable governmental taking, as, inter alia, Anchorage, Alaska, Municipal Code &sect; 10.40.050 had no legally significant economic impact on the owner. His interest in preserving continuity of telephone numbers and advertising accounts did not vest rights in him that rendered &sect; 10.40.050 unenforceable. The ordinance did not violate his free speech rights under the Central Hudson test; the city had a substantial interest in regulating adult-oriented businesses, and the ordinance advanced that interest by preventing those who advertised such businesses from operating without a license.</SPAN></P>

Appellee injury fund subsequently filed suit for reimbursement of benefits based on the employee's fraud.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the employee argued that applying the preponderance of the evidence standard was unconstitutional and violated due process. The employee argued that Alaska Stat. 23.30.250(b) remedy was penal, and that because of that, a heightened standard of proof was required. The appellate court rejected the employee's argument. Section 23.30.250 only required restitution of benefits that were fraudulently obtained and reimbursement of the employer's expenses occasioned by the fraud. Therefore, the remedy was not penal. The appellate court found that Alaska Stat. &sect; 44.62.460(e) directed that the standard of proof in administrative hearings be by a preponderance of the evidence, unless applicable law specified a different standard. As no statute relating to the employer's reimbursement claims addressed the issue of what standard of proof was appropriate, the default standard of &sect; 44.62.460 applied. Further, the interest of the litigants on both sides was primarily monetary. Thus, the employee's economic interests did not stand on a higher footing than the economic interests of the employer in the context of the civil fraud claim were brought.</SPAN></P>

Before trial, the trial court ruled the injuries claimed were interference with plaintiff neighbors' real property rights and Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.10.050, which imposed a six-year limitations period, applied. The jury found that defendant neighbor had created a nuisance on his property, plaintiff neighbors had not defamed him, and their property was grandfathered under the zoning statute. The trial court did not err in not requiring plaintiff neighbors to prove nuisance by clear and convincing evidence instead of allowing them to use the preponderance of the evidence standard, or in applying a six, rather than a two year statute of limitations, noting it had to look to the type of injuries claimed, as opposed to the causes of action pled, to determine which was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case brought by plaintiffs, all injured parties contemplating tort action, challenging tort reform legislation enacted by the Alaska Legislature in 1997 Alaska Sess. Laws 26, the Superior Court, Fourth Judicial District, Bethel, Alaska, granted summary judgment to defendant State of Alaska and refused to enter a declaratory judgment that the legislation was void under the Alaska Constitution. The injured parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged legislation placed caps on noneconomic and punitive damages, required that half of all punitive damages awards be paid into the state treasury, imposed a 10-year statute of repose, modified the tolling procedure for the statute of limitations as applied to minors, established comparative allocation of fault between parties and non-parties, revised the offer of judgment procedure, and provided partial immunity for hospitals from vicarious liability for some physicians' actions. The instant court concluded that the legislation was facially constitutional. The damages caps did not actually limit access to the courts, but simply limited a plaintiff's recovery in civil court. The damages caps did not infringe on the right to a trial by jury. The damages caps did not deny substantive due process, constitute a denial of equal protection, violate the separation of powers, or violate the ban on &quot;special legislation.&quot; The State's &quot;tort reform&quot; objectives were legitimate. The allocation of fault to nonparties provision was not void for vagueness and did not violate substantive due process rights. The statute of repose did not violate equal protection or due process.</SPAN></P>

Whether they acted maliciously was a factual question not suitable for disposition on the pleadings. The appellate court could not decide without factual context whether the training and supervisory activities the citizen attributed to the troopers involved planning functions entitling them to discretionary function immunity.

The appellate court rejected the employee's arguments. The only evidence the employee provided that he was permanently disabled was his own testimony. The board found the employee was not a credible witness and it was within the board's power to determine the credibility of the employee.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee injured his back while working for his employer, an airline. This workers' compensation case arose out of that injury and his employment record with the airline before and after the date of the accident. The employee appealed the determinations by the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board concerning his permanent partial impairment rating, his entitlement to additional temporary total disability benefits, and his compensation rate. He also claimed the workers' compensation administrator unfairly controverted his claim. Finally, the employee argued he was entitled to penalties, interest, attorney fees, and costs. On review, the appellate court held as follows: (1) The Board's calculations were supported by substantial evidence; (2) at the time of the controversion, the employee was not entitled to a lump sum award, and thus, the controversion was not unfair or frivolous; and (3) the Board correctly addressed the employee's claims regarding his entitlement to penalties, interest, attorney fees, and costs.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the employer properly controverted all benefits on the basis of the physicians' reports. Therefore, substantial evidence supported the denial of penalties and benefits. The court also found that, while the trial court erred in dismissing 11 of the employee's claims for inadequate briefing without giving him an opportunity to correct the briefing, the error was harmless, as the claims were meritless. Two claims, however, had merit, and the court remanded those two claims for factual determinations.

The board passed a new plan and filed a motion to expedite notice of compliance and request for entry of judgment. The Superior Court, Third Judicial District (Alaska), found the plan constitutional in all respects. Appellant voters challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the voters raised several arguments, including: (1) that the 9.96 percent maximum state wide deviation was constitutionally excessive; (2) that local boundaries should have been recognized in setting the districts; and (3) that some districts were &quot;noncompact,&quot; as they were largely unpopulated and roadless. The appellate court rejected the voters' arguments and held the board's plan complied with their mandate on remand and was not otherwise unconstitutional. The court found that the deviations were not unconstitutionally excessive, as the board was directed on remand to make a good faith effort to reduce deviations across the Anchorage Bowl districts, and the board clearly did so. Further, all other challenges to the deviations could have been raised against the original plan, and therefore could not be raised for the first time on appeal. The court also found that while respect for neighborhood boundaries in the redistricting process was an admirable goal, it was not constitutionally required and had to give way to other legal requirements. Finally, the court held that neither size nor lack of direct road access made a district unconstitutionally noncompact.</SPAN></P>

On appeal by the defendant, the Alaska Court of Appeals found the sentencing statute unconstitutional and vacated the murder sentence. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the defendant's sentence was procedurally flawed, as Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.125(a) represented a new, harsher penalty than the usual maximum penalty for first-degree murder. On appeal, the State argued that, even without relying on the aggravating circumstances spelled out in the mandatory sentencing provision, the sentencing court could have sentenced the defendant to exactly the same term that she received under the statute. Because the sentencing judge had discretion to impose the same sentence, the statute could not plausibly be construed to mandate any increase in the potential maximum sentence. The appellate court agreed with the State. The mandatory sentencing provisions of &sect; 12.55.125(a) did not subject the defendant to a greater maximum penalty than was otherwise authorized. The statute did not eliminate all sentencing discretion, as the sentencing court had the power to impose the sentence independent of the mandatory provision. Additionally, the sentencing judge made it clear that she would have imposed the same sentence, even if the statute had not made it mandatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal's order remanding the case for resentencing was vacated, and the sentence, as originally imposed by the trial court, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Likewise, his vagueness challenge to the borough code at issue had to be evaluated in light of his proposed use, not in the abstract. Because the owner did not make any attempt to exhaust his remedies administratively, the superior court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing his case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks awarded shared custody of appellant father's child to the father and appellee stepmother, upon finding that the stepmother was the psychological parent of child. The trial court also ordered the father to either reinstate the stepmother to his health insurance policy or pay for her surgery out of his share of his pension. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that, under Alaska law, those relationships that affected the child, which were based upon psychological rather than biological parentage, may be important enough to protect through custody and visitation to ensure that the child's best interests were being served. The supreme court found that there was ample evidence in the record to support the trial court's finding that the stepmother was the child's psychological parent, and that finding was not clearly erroneous. Moreover, the trial court did not err in applying a standard other than the best interests test and determining under the Turner standard, that removing the child from the stepmother's life would be detrimental and devastating to the child. Finally, the supreme court concluded that the father's unilateral removal of the mother from his health insurance policy, which precluded her from obtaining much needed surgery, constituted dissipation of a marital asset. The trial court's order that the father either reinstate the mother's coverage or pay her medical bill was within its broad discretion to fairly allocate the economic consequences of the divorce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company operated a commercial rock quarrying operation under a licensing agreement from appellant railroad. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, enjoined the company's operations after the appellees village and residents (village) filed suit alleging that the company was operating a quarry in violation of the applicable zoning ordinances of the Municipality of Anchorage. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States government owned and operated the quarry until 1985. In 1989, the state owned railroad obtained full ownership of the quarry, and the railroad continued to own the quarry to the time of the present litigation. In 1995, the railroad entered into a licensing agreement with the company that gave the company the exclusive use of the quarry for quarrying operations. The company's quarrying operations exceeded the size and scope of the previous state and federal operations that had been undertaken in a more cyclical and limited manner. The appellate court held that operation of the quarry did not constitute either nonconforming or a continued use, as Anchorage, Alaska, Mun. Code &sect; 21.55.090 governed the zoning of mineral operations, of which quarry operations were a part, and grandfather provisions did not apply, as the quarry was not a lawful conditional use in 1977.

On appeal, the employer claimed that the case law only applied retroactively to claims open to adjudication. The appellate court affirmed the retroactive adjustment. The court found that the employer was on notice of the claim for a retroactive compensation rate adjustment and did not object, therefore the employer waived any statute of limitation defense, and the claim was open to adjudication. The court also found that there was a substantial disparity in the employee's earnings at the time of his injury and his earnings as computed under the statute. Also, the employee testified that he intended to increase his amount of work to purchase a house. Therefore, substantial evidence supported the finding that the employee's past employment history was not an accurate predictor of his future lost income.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1997, the Alaska Legislature passed S.B. 24, an act that prohibited doctors from performing abortions on unemancipated women under seventeen years of age without parental consent or judicial authorization and that subjected doctors to criminal penalties for knowingly performing abortions on minors without the required consent or authorization. Soon after the legislature enacted this parental consent or judicial authorization requirement, two doctors and a lobbyist group filed an action claiming that the act was void because it violated the Alaska Constitution's guarantees of privacy, equal protection, freedom from discrimination based on sex, and due process. The superior court agreed. On review, the state supreme court disagreed. The superior court erred in declining to hear evidence on and to decide the central questions whether the state had a compelling interest in enforcing the parental consent statute and whether the statute was properly tailored to promote the state's interest.</SPAN></P>

The Alaska Supreme Court found that the case was moot because: (1) the initiative sponsors were not party to the proceedings; (2) the initiative petition was dead; (3) there was no current controversy as to whom the excise tax applied; and (4) no exception to the mootness doctrine applied to these facts.</SPAN></P>

The oil company argued, inter alia, that the PBUA abrogated the DNR's discretion to deny expansion and to order contraction of the unit, and that the DNR had agreed to terms that differed from its own regulations. The supreme court disagreed. The text of the PBUA and the extrinsic evidence of the parties' course of conduct supported the conclusion that the DNR had discretion to deny expansion. The DNR did not, and could not, contract away its discretion to consider the state's best interests in approving expansions of the unit, and the company did not have a unilateral right to expansion under the PBUA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patients asserted that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.120(a)(2) violated their constitutional rights, inter alia, to privacy and liberty. They argued that their strong interest in personal autonomy encompassed physician-assisted suicide and justified locating that right within the core of the constitution's guarantees of privacy and liberty. The supreme court disagreed. It held that &sect; 11.41.120(a)(2) was not unconstitutional. The right to physician-assisted suicide was not implicit in text, context, or history of the Alaska Constitution's liberty and privacy clauses. While those guarantees encompassed a broad range of autonomy, they did not require an exemption to Alaska's manslaughter statute that would provide for physician-assisted suicide. By broadly construing the privacy amendment to include the right to assisted suicide, the supreme court would run the risk of arrogating to itself the powers to make social policy that as a constitutional matter belonged only to the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fishers sued defendant fish packing company seeking damages for breach of contract, conversion, and unjust enrichment. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Dillingham, ruled in favor of the packing company.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The packing company shipped herring caught by the fishers to China to be stripped of roe before being sold; this unprofitable deviation from ordinary practice resulted in only a $ 27.56 per ton profit. The fishers sought damages in the amount of profits they would have been paid under an alleged profit sharing arrangement if the fish had been sold whole. The appellate court held the record supported the trial court's conclusion that there was insufficient evidence that the parties had actually agreed to a profit sharing program. The trial court's decision to discredit the inconsistent testimony of one fisher, while giving credit to the company's president's deposition testimony that there was no agreement, was not clearly erroneous. The documentary evidence was insufficient to establish an enforceable profit-sharing agreement as it lacked sufficiently definite and specific price terms. There was unrebutted expert testimony that the price received by the fishers was a fair price. The award of attorney's fees was not clearly erroneous; there were not a lot of unnecessary filings, delay, or bad faith by the company, and the fishers bore some responsibility for the fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner argued that: (1) the trial court erred when it dismissed his case for failure to pay the filing fee; and (2) the exemption from filing fees under Alaska Stat. 09.19.010 was an unconstitutional violation of equal protection. The Supreme Court of Alaska held that: (1) the trial court did err in dismissing the prisoner's case because on December 28, the judge properly vacated the November 9 order as premature, however, he concluded that the prisoner's case should still be dismissed because he had not paid the filing fee by the end of December, and after the entry of the dismissal order on November 9, there was no reason to expect the prisoner to pay the filing fee for a dismissed case; and (2) the statute was not unconstitutional because the circumstances of an indigent prisoner were different from the circumstances of an indigent non-prisoner; indigent prisoners had their basic needs met by the state, while a nonprisoner filing a civil action against the state might worry that payment of the filing fee meant that the rent would not be paid or that groceries could not be purchased.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The manner in which the State allocates public benefits is subject to constitutional limitation under Alaska's equal protection provision. The State, having undertaken to provide health care for poor Alaskans, must adhere to neutral criteria in distributing that care. It may not deny medically necessary services to eligible individuals based on criteria unrelated to the purposes of the public health care program. Moreover, the DHSS regulation in this case discriminatorily burdens the exercise of a constitutional right. Because we conclude that denial of Medicaid assistance to poor women who medically require abortions violates equal protection, we AFFIRM the decision of the superior court.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Alaska's Medicaid program denied funding for medically necessary abortions. Women whose health was endangered by pregnancy were denied health care based solely on political disapproval of the medically necessary procedure. The State, having enacted a benefits program, was not permitted to discriminate between recipients in the manner attempted by the Department of Health and Social Services through Alaska Admin. Code tit. 7, &sect; 43.140 (2000). Section 43.140, which denied Medicaid assistance for medically necessary abortions unless the pregnant woman was at risk of dying or her pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, impermissibly interfered with Medicaid-eligible women's constitutional rights to privacy. The State failed to articulate a compelling state interest for this interference. The mere fact that the legislature's appropriations power underlies Medicaid funding could not insulate the program from constitutional review. Section 43.140 was in violation of Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

The Juneau Superior Court (Alaska) granted the corporation's motion for summary judgment, and plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contended that the elder benefit diverted the wealth from the corporation's present owners in violation of principles of corporate law as well as the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), 43 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1601 et seq. (1986 &amp; Supp. 2000). The supreme court unanimously agreed with the trial court that the elder stock program was authorized by ANCSA, and was not precluded by Alaska corporate law, so long as the shareholders had properly approved the program in the proxy solicitation. ANCSA permitted issuing elder stock without consideration, and nothing in the language or history of the statute indicated that Congress intended to limit the power of native corporations to issue such stock selectively only to elders who continued to own original shares of settlement common stock. The four participating members of the court were equally divided as to the remaining issues of whether the corporation had satisfied its disclosure duty under federal law in its proxy statement soliciting votes for program. Therefore the judgment in favor of defendant was also affirmed on that point.</SPAN></P>

Employees in public safety positions, such as police officers and firefighters, were subject to random testing and to promotion-demotion-transfer testing.

The instant court held that the trial court did not err, for the most part, in concluding that a &quot;special need&quot; for testing existed here. The municipality's interest in ensuring public safety was sufficiently compelling to outweigh the intrusion on privacy that occurred under the municipality's drug testing policy. The balance of individual versus governmental interests tipped decidedly in the municipality's favor. However, the instant court, noting that there was no documented history of substance abuse problems among the unions' members, also held that the random testing provision was unreasonable and thus violated Alaska Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska), which dismissed its defense that plaintiff class members failed to exhaust administrative remedies, certified the class, and found Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.23.005(a)(5)(B)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The class appealed the rejection of its claim that the statutory eligibility requirements for legal aliens amounted to national origin discrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court was asked whether &sect; 43.23.005(a)(5)(B), which restricts alien permanent fund dividend (PFD) eligibility to those who are lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States, violated the Supremacy Clause and the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. Lead plaintiffs were denied PFDs because the Department of Revenue determined that they could not legally form the intent to remain in Alaska indefinitely based on their immigrant status. The instant court concluded that the alien eligibility requirement of &sect; 43.23.005(a)(5)(B) was constitutional, as the department had the authority to interpret the statutory language in a manner that met the purposes of the PFD program and that comported with federal law. Because it would have been futile for class members to apply for a PFD, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed the State's exhaustion of administrative remedies defense. The requirements of class certification were satisfied in this case. The eligibility requirements for legal aliens did not amount to national origin discrimination under the Alaska Human Rights Act.</SPAN></P>

The instant court reversed the decision that &sect; 43.23.005(a)(5)(B) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Alaska Stat. &sect; 22.10.020(g) granted power to the superior courts to issue declaratory judgments in cases of actual controversy. A dismissal of a declaratory judgment action was reversed only for abuse of discretion. The ripeness doctrine required appellants to claim that either a legal injury had been suffered or that one will be suffered in the future. Ripeness turned on the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with sexually assaulting the victim. When he raised the defense of consent, Alaska R. Evid. 404(b)(3) permitted the State to call a witness to testify that petitioner had previously had nonconsensual sex with her. The superior court denied petitioner's request that the jury be told that another jury had acquitted him of sexually assaulting that witness. Because the supreme court concluded that the evidence of that acquittal was relevant and not hearsay, that its potential for confusion did not outweigh its potential probative value, and that its exclusion prejudiced petitioner, the supreme court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The prior acquittal did not prove the truth of the historical facts of the first case; it proved only that the previous jury did not find that the State proved all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, the acquittal was potentially useful in deciding whether petitioner recklessly disregarded the victim's lack of consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the designation of two areas as controlled use areas (CUAs). Besides contending that the regulations establishing the CUAs violated the state constitution, appellant contended that they exceeded appellee's authority and were unreasonable and arbitrary. Confining its review to consistency with the authorizing statute, along with reasonableness and lack of arbitrariness, the court concluded that the CUAs were within appellee's statutory authority. The regulation authorizing appellee to minimize conflicts between users of off-road vehicles and others was authorized. Appellee was not barred from regulating airboats on navigable waters. The regulations were reasonable and not arbitrary. Turning to state constitutional claims, appellant's main argument was that the CUAs created and protected &quot;local, monopolistic interests&quot; by putting non-local hunters who preferred other methods of hunting transportation at a disadvantage. However, appellant's multi-faceted constitutional argument was answered by recent decisions of the court. Distinctions based on the type of equipment used in the harvest of a resource were not prohibited by the Alaska Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Alaska voters approved a medical marijuana initiative, which was codified as Alaska Stat. &sect; 17.37.010. The law allowed Alaskans with debilitating conditions to use marijuana for medical purposes upon a physician's certification. To ensure compliance with its provisions, the law required users to register with the Department of Health and Social Services; the department then issued identification cards and maintained a registry of authorized users. Subsequently, plaintiff filed a complaint, claiming the measure violated privacy rights by requiring registration. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, declaring the law constitutional. The court affirmed. The registry required disclosure of sensitive information and identified a person as suffering from a debilitating medical condition and as being a marijuana user. However, the law did not require users to divulge any details about their debilitating conditions. It explicitly required the department to keep the registry confidential. It was closed to public access. Only authorized public officials could use it and their use was confined to narrowly specified purposes.</SPAN></P>

Appellee remarried his wife, and sought to adopt the child. Appellant's consent to the adoption was waived, and the adoption was granted. This ruling was reversed, and on remand, appellee alleged the child was conceived as a result of appellant's rape of the mother. The superior court granted the adoption, relying on Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.23.180. The appellate court affirmed, finding: substantial evidence supported the finding that the child's conception resulted from a sexual assault by appellant; Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.23.180 did not require a conviction of sexual assault as a prerequisite to waiving appellant's consent; terminating appellant's paternal rights in the adoption proceeding did not trigger the constitutional guarantees that attach to a criminal prosecution; and collateral estoppel did not bar the court from deciding whether the child was conceived as a result of sexual assault, since that issue had not been properly raised before.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee's driver's license was revoked by appellant following appellee's arrest for underage consumption of alcohol. The trial court reversed the revocation, declaring Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.15.183&nbsp;unconstitutional. Appellant challenged the ruling, claiming the trial court erred in declaring the statute unconstitutional. The court held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.15.183 was unconstitutional, as it was punitive in nature, and did not provide appellee with procedural due process. The court held there was no direct connection between the alleged offense and appellant's regulatory goal of removing unfit drivers from the road. Under the statute, a minor's possession or consumption of alcohol need have no connection to driving; hence, the conduct triggering revocation does not necessarily, or even probably, reflect on the arrested minor's fitness to drive. There was no indication that appellee posed a specific risk of bad driving, or that he intended to drive at all. The court held appellee could not impose the punitive measure of license revocation without criminal process. Because appellee was not afforded procedural due process, the court affirmed the decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were charged with &quot;creek robbing&quot; after the State mistakenly thought appellants were fishing in a prohibited salmon-spawning stream. The State seized appellants' boat and issued misdemeanor citations. At a hearing for the boat's release on bond, the State informed the court that it had charged appellants in error, but despite department guidelines to the contrary, refused to dismiss its civil in rem forfeiture complaint against the boat. The forfeiture claim was eventually dismissed, and appellants sued, seeking damages for an unconstitutional taking and common-law conversion. The trial court denied the claims. The court affirmed, holding that the class of movable property at issue, fishing boats that the State had probable cause to believe were used in commercial fishing violations, and thus subject to forfeiture, presented more than a negligible risk of removal or concealment. The State did not need to compensate appellants for lost profits. Second, there was no violation of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court judgment affirmed. An in rem action under the relevant criminal statute was not an exercise of the State's constitutional taking power requiring just compensation, and there was no violation of double jeopardy by continuing to pursue the civil in rem forfeiture after criminally prosecuting appellants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had previously concluded that the blanket primary election prescribed in Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.25.060 did not clearly deprive political parties of their right of free association, as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I. The court also had found &sect; 15.25.060 to be constitutional. However, subsequently, the United States Supreme Court decided that California's blanket primary statute violated U.S. Const. amend. I's guarantee of associational freedom. In light of the subsequent ruling, the court held that its previous ruling that &sect; 15.025.060 was constitutional was no longer tenable. Section 15.25.060 was clearly unconstitutional. Respondent had authority to abrogate the statute and to promulgate emergency regulations to implement a primary election that complied with the constitutional mandate. Respondent's power to take temporary action needed to ensure a timely and constitutional primary was solidly rooted in the principle of necessity and in respondent's statutory powers of supervision over elections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1998, Alaska voters passed an initiative requiring that English be used by all public agencies. Two groups of plaintiffs challenged the initiative's constitutionality. Appellants, two incorporated organizations which supported the initiative, moved to intervene under Alaska R. Civ. P. 24(a) and (b). The plaintiffs opposed the motion but the state did not. The superior court denied the organizations' motion to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a), holding that their interests were adequately represented by the state, and denied permissive intervention under Rule 24(b), holding that they could more effectively participate as amici curiae. On appeal, the court reversed as to one appellant, because the incorporators of the group were also the sponsors on the initiative committee, and the executive branch had publicly opposed the initiative before the election. The court affirmed as to second appellant, because it did not have the same connections with the initiative's sponsors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant appealed a decision of appellee Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, affirmed by the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, dismissing as moot his petition for compulsory unitization of two oil and gas leases that expired the day after he petitioned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision of appellee commission (appellee), affirmed by the trial court, dismissing as moot his petition for compulsory unitization of two oil and gas leases that expired the day after he petitioned. The commission noted reasons of public policy for disallowing compulsory lease extensions through compulsory unitization, observing that when a petitioner can no longer be granted any relief, due to the petitioner's loss of a real stake in the outcome, the matter should be dismissed. On appeal, the court found that appellant was an &quot;interested person&quot; and had standing to petition for unitization. Further, the expiration of the leases did not deprive appellant of standing or deprive the appellee of jurisdiction. The court held that the appellee had discretion to order unitization effective upon the date of filing of a proper petition and that its exercise of this discretion was a matter for case-specific determination rather than a matter of jurisdiction. Because the appellee did not dispute that appellant's petition was proper when filed or that a retroactive unitization order would operate to extend appellant's leases, the court reversed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. The court found that appellant was entitled to a hearing on the merits of his unitization petition. Appellant's petition was properly filed, was within the appellee's commission's jurisdiction, and could not be deemed moot as long as retroactivity was within the appellee commission's discretion to order.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that it owed taxes under Alaska's Motor Fuel Tax Act (Act) only for fuel actually burned in Alaska. However, the lower court upheld appellee's assessment and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that although the Act taxed jet fuel &quot;consumed,&quot; it measured consumption at the gas pump and not in the airplane. Pertaining to the statutory interpretation of the term &quot;consumption,&quot; the court found that consumption was commonly and conveniently measured at the pump, and that there was no reason to presume that the legislature intended to adopt the less common and sensible measure proffered by appellant, namely the moment of actual combustion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A worker assembling a perforation gun at appellant's plant, accidentally triggered a fatal explosion. Appellee fined appellant for violating process safety management standards, finding these standards applicable because assembling perforation guns qualified as manufacturing explosives. Trial court ruled that appellee could only enforce the safety standards prospectively, since their application to perforation gun assembly had previously been uncertain. Appellant claimed that the standards did not apply even prospectively, arguing that assembling perforation guns was not the manufacture of explosives but fell within a regulatory exemption for oil well servicing activities. Alternatively, it argued that the regulations were unenforceable for vagueness. The court concluded that the safety standards applied and were sufficiently clear to withstand constitutional challenge. The court determined that the manufacture of perforation guns was the manufacture of explosives. Thus, manufacture of the perforation gun had to comply with the Alaska Explosives Code and the process safety management regulation.</SPAN></P>

Evid. 801(d)(2), in that those two guilty pleas were defendant's personal admissions that he engaged in the criminal conduct charged against him; [3]-Even if defendant might have been entitled to a bifurcation of his trial, holding a unitary trial was not error under the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Because the majority of defendants convicted of driving while intoxicated in Texas have consumed alcohol or a controlled substance, the broader reach of the Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 49.04 is limited to a narrow spectrum of unusual cases and the Texas statute is therefore similar, for felony classification/sentencing purposes, to the Alaska driving under the influence statute, as that term is defined in AS 28.35.030(u)(4)(A); [2]-Under the Texas statute, the government had to prove that the defendant's intoxication was caused by the introduction of a substance into the body, and under Alaska law, the State had to prove that the defendant was driving under the influence of a substance, and thus the court found no merit in defendant's claim that the statutes were dissimilar; [3]-The court affirmed defendant's conviction of a felony based on his prior out-of-state convictions.</SPAN></P>

His conduct fell squarely within the terms of the statute. There was no question that he intended to solicit two police officers, who were posing as 14-year-old girls, to masturbate for his own sexual gratification. With the narrow construction the court adopted, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The failure to instruct the jury with the narrow construction was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, Alaska, upheld defendant's conditions of parole and denied his motion to consolidate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his special conditions of parole violated the prohibition on ex post facto laws because this statute was not effective when he was convicted in 1979 and 1984. The appellate court found that the Board was authorized to set special conditions of mandatory parole when defendant committed his offenses in 1979 and 1984, based on the statutes enacted in 1960. The enactment of a new parole statute in 1985 did not increase his punishment in a way that violated the ex post facto clauses. The special conditions imposed on defendant's parole release were inherent in the criminal judgments imposed by the sentencing courts when he was convicted in 1979 and 1984. Since these conditions were authorized by defendant's original sentences, they did not increase his sentence when they were imposed in 2005. The imposition of special conditions was consistent with the grant of authority under Alaska Const. art. 3, &sect; 21 and did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers. He did not establish that his parole conditions violated his privilege against self-incrimination. Defendant did not show an abuse of discretion by the trial judge when he denied the motion to consolidate.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the seatbelt law was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the record showed that when the legislature first enacted the seatbelt law, the legislature was presented with ample testimony and documentary evidence indicating that the law would increase seatbelt use, would prevent injuries, and would save lives and money. When the seatbelt law was under consideration, several highway safety experts told the legislature that a seatbelt law which authorized police officers to stop motorists for not wearing seatbelts was an effective measure for reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries from highway accidents. Defendant failed to offer a persuasive rebuttal to that testimony. In defendant's case, the police had probable cause: it was undisputed that the officer observed defendant driving without wearing a seatbelt. The appellate court rejected defendant's proposed interpretation of Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 14 that would have the courts invalidate arrests and traffic stops on policy grounds. Defendant's argument that the legislature's real purpose in enacting the seatbelt law was to provide the police with a pretext to stop motorists.</SPAN></P>

App. P. 204(a)(4) provided that a motion to correct an illegal sentence would extend the time limit for an appeal from a criminal conviction but did not state that such a motion would affect the deadline for requesting postconviction relief. The petition for hearing was denied on August 27, 2004, making appellant's convictions final; thus, the application was not filed within one year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Kenai, Alaska, which convicted him of failure to register as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that defendant was actually residing with his fiancee but that, on his registration form, defendant falsely indicated that he was residing with his brother. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that defendant never actually changed his residence and that he continued to reside with his fiance. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction. The court rejected defendant's argument that the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.63.010, was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. Although defendant contended that the statute could be vague if, for instance, the person who was required to register shared his time equally among two places, this was not how defendant's case was presented to the jury. The question for the jury in this case was whether defendant resided with his fiance or whether he had truly changed his residence and was living with his brother. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to give a jury instruction defining the term &quot;residence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court, Third Judicial District, Palmer, Alaska, convicted defendant of violating the state's commercial motor vehicle regulations by operating a commercial motor vehicle without a valid medical examiner's certificate and by operating a commercial motor vehicle that had been placed out of service for safety violations. Defendant appealed, and the cases were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State had no authority to enforce the federal law regulating commercial motor vehicles. The appellate court found that the adopted portions of the federal regulations were now state law and were enforced by various state agencies. By expressly adopting the pertinent portions of the federal regulations and revising them as necessary to apply them to Alaska roadways, the State Department of Transportation acted consistently with its statutory authority and the legislature's objective. The evidence showed that defendant was operating a commercial motor vehicle where defendant presented no evidence that his vehicle was exempt from the state regulations because it was used &quot;exclusively&quot; for non-commercial purposes. Defendant was using his tractor-trailer to haul property belonging to another person or persons. Even if he did not receive monetary compensation, defendant was engaged in activities that were incidental to and done in furtherance of his business. Defendant did not show that the State failed to turn over exculpatory evidence, nor did he show that he was prejudiced in any way. Defendant was not entitled to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant was convicted of attempted murder and sexual assault. For attempted murder, defendant was sentenced to 20 years in prison with 5 years suspended. For sexual assault, the superior court sentenced defendant to 14 years in prison with 4 years suspended. To comply with the agreement that he would receive a composite 20-year sentence, the judge declared that the two sentences would be partially consecutive. On appeal, defendant sought clarification of the order in which he was to serve his sentences. The Court of Appeals of Alaska directed the superior court to amend defendant's written judgment to indicate that defendant's 10-year sentence for sexual assault was his primary sentence, followed by a partially concurrent sentence of 15 years for attempted murder. The superior court judge was not required to hold a new sentencing hearing; defendant had no right of allocution and no right to be present. Defendant was not denied his right to prompt sentencing, as both he and his attorney understood his sentence.

Because defendant had questions, the officer explained that the independent test was not required. Defendant said that he did not want an independent test. He filed a motion to suppress the results of the breath test. The trial court did not err by denying the motion. The Court of Appeals of Alaska found that the record showed defendant had the information he needed to knowingly and intelligently waive his right to an independent test. The officer acted in good faith and took reasonable steps to administer the breath test in a timely manner. The breath test was a valid search incident to arrest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the superior court was obliged to sentence him within the lower presumptive range, as if the government had attempted but failed to prove that he personally carried a firearm. The appellate court found that it did not violate the U.S. Const. amend. VI to hold a jury trial on the disputed factual issue. The Blakely right to jury trial applied to the factors listed in Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.125(c)(2). If the sentence enhancement factors listed in &sect; 12.55.125(c)(2) were resolved in the government's favor, a defendant was subjected to a higher presumptive range of imprisonment than the defendant would otherwise face as a first felony offender convicted of a class A felony. If the flaw in defendant's case had been that the jury instructions omitted or misdefined an essential element of the offense of first-degree robbery, defendant would be entitled to a new trial, not a claim of acquittal under the double jeopardy clause. Defendant raised his jury trial claim after his trial was over, but before his sentencing. The trial judge acted properly when he ordered the jury to decide the disputed sentencing factor.</SPAN></P>

He filed a motion for post-conviction relief, alleging the ineffective assistance of counsel. He was not entitled to relief. The Court of Appeals of Alaska held that appellant's trial attorneys were not incompetent for failing to raise a &quot;personal use&quot; defense to the marijuana possession charge. Appellant was not harmed by his attorneys' failure to object to the faulty jury instruction on the elements of maintaining a structure to unlawfully keep or distribute a controlled substance. Appellant's claim that the protective sweep of his apartment was illegal did not prove that he was actually innocent of the weapons and controlled substances offenses. Appellant did not prove that his appellate attorney gave him incompetent advice concerning the choices that he faced after the Court of Appeals of Alaska reversed his weapons conviction but affirmed his drug convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's hunting partner transported and surrendered to wildlife troopers the salvaged meat and antlers from a sub-legal bull moose. The hunting partner also provided the troopers with a transfer of possession statement - that is, a statement documenting defendant's transfer of the meat and antlers to the hunting partner. This statement identified defendant as the hunter who took the moose, but it did not contain any admission or assertion that the moose was taken illegally. Defendant contended that: (1) the state hunting regulations violated the privilege against self-incrimination, and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support the guilty verdict. The instant court concluded that defendant failed to rebut the presumption that the regulations were constitutional. Defendant's briefing was simply inadequate to permit the instant court to address the constitutional issue. The instant court further concluded, based on the stipulated facts, that there was substantial evidence supporting the trial court's conclusion that defendant had violated state game regulations by taking a bull moose that had sub-legal antlers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence against him was gathered illegally. Defendant also argued that the child pornography statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.127(a), was unconstitutionally overbroad. The appellate court found that the statute required proof of an actus reus, that defendant possessed pornographic material depicting conduct described in Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.455(a)--the statute prohibiting the sexual exploitation of minors. The appellate court construed Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.127(a) to forbid the possession of pornographic material that was generated by the conduct prohibited by Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.455(a)--pornography that was generated by the use of a child under the age of 18. The search warrant application provided probable cause to believe that the images were evidence of someone's knowing possession of child pornography. When the information presented to the magistrate was analyzed in context and in a commonsense manner, that information was sufficient to establish reasonable grounds to believe that the &quot;images&quot; and &quot;pictures&quot; on the computer were in fact photographs of minor children engaged in sexual conduct described in Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.455(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree sexual assault and two counts of fourth degree assault for separate attacks that he committed upon his girlfriend on June 26 and 27, 2002. On remand to correct Blakely error, the Superior Court, First Judicial District, Ketchikan, Alaska, imposed a composite sentence of 24 years to serve. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court lacked the legal authority to hold a jury trial on the State's proposed aggravating factors. The instant court concluded that it was both proper and necessary for the trial court to hold a jury trial on those aggravating factors. Even if it were assumed that the victim's heightened psychological or emotional vulnerability on June 27 was the result of defendant's previous sexual assault on her on June 26, the trial court did not err when it considered the aggravator set forth in Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155(c)(5) when formulating defendant's sentence for the June 27th sexual assault. Although the State may not have pointed to a specific psychiatric diagnosis or defined mental condition, the record contained evidence that defendant repeatedly engaged in manipulative, controlling, and violent behavior toward the victim during their relationship. Thus, a jury might have been justified in concluding that defendant exerted control over the victim to such an extent that she suffered emotional or psychological vulnerability. The trial court was not clearly mistaken when it sentenced defendant to a composite term of 24 years to serve.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted in the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska) for possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.200(a)(1). Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that &sect; 11.61.200 violated Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The motion was denied. Following defendant's conviction, he appealed the denial of his motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statute prohibiting a felon from possessing a concealable firearm violated Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 19, because it did not differentiate between violent and non-violent felons, and thus was not narrowly tailored to achieve the State's compelling interest in preventing violent crime. He argued that because article I, &sect; 19, guaranteed an individual's right to keep and bear arms, any law that restricting that right must be narrowly tailored to protect a compelling government interest. He had been convicted of theft in the second degree for fraudulently obtaining unemployment benefits, a non-violent crime, was 67 years old, lived alone, and needed a gun for protection. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to &sect; 11.61.200. Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 19, does not limit the State's authority to regulate firearms when there is a significant risk that firearms will be used in a criminal or dangerous fashion. Because the legislature had the authority to regulate the possession of firearms by convicted felons, and because article I, &sect; 19 did not restrict that authority, the statute did not violate the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Palmer, Alaska, that convicted him of second-degree assault, criminal trespass, and violating a domestic violence restraining order, arguing that the superior court erred in permitting the joinder of offenses committed against different victims on different occasions and erred in admitting evidence of prior bad acts under Alaska R. Evid. 404.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assaulted his girlfriend, grabbing her by the neck and strangling her. The State moved to join the assault charge with two charges involving another girlfriend. The superior court allowed the joinder. On review, the court held that the superior court did not err in permitting the joinder under Alaska R. Crim. P. 8 and 13 because the offenses were of the same or similar character where they arose from a unifying motivation and pattern of behavior and because evidence of the offenses committed against one victim would be admissible at trial on charges of the offenses committed against the other. The offenses against the two women were intertwined because defendant, shortly after his assault on his second girlfriend, called the state troopers and accused the second girlfriend of assaulting him and asserted that she was motivated to assault him because of the bad blood between him and his first girlfriend. Further, evidence that defendant had previously strangled another woman was admissible under Alaska R. Evid. 404(b)(1) because it established defendant's pattern of strangling women who challenged his authority and rebutted his claim of self-defense.</SPAN></P>

Judgment was entered against the inmate again. This appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court held that there was a time limit for filing an initial PCR application under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.72.020(a)(3)(A). Because the inmate was convicted prior to July 1, 1994, she had until July 1, 1996, to file her claim. If the inmate's allegations were accepted as true, the appellate court concluded that she mailed a PCR within the statute of limitations. However, the inmate's claim that she made a timely filing was inconsistent with the claim that she was prevented from filing. Also, the inmate did not present a prima facie case that she failed to file because she received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorneys she claimed should have filed an application on her behalf prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations. The trial court did not err in dismissing the claim based on newly discovered evidence. If the inmate was able to prove her case, it appeared that she had one layered claim of ineffective assistance of counsel remaining.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska) of misconduct involving weapons and defendant subsequently pleaded no contest to possession of a concealable firearm by a felon. The State appealed the court's pretrial ruling involving defendant's statements to law enforcement personnel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued, inter alia, that Alaska R. Evid. 412 permitted the State to impeach defendant's testimony with statements obtained in violation of defendant's invocation of the Miranda right to silence or counsel. The court of appeals disagreed. Rule 412 was unconstitutional under the Alaska Constitution to the extent that it permitted impeachment in cases where the violation of Miranda was either intentional or egregious - meaning a violation that would have been obvious to any reasonable police officer. Because Rule 412 authorized the government to impeach testifying defendants with statements obtained in violation of Miranda, Rule 412 significantly weakened the exclusionary rule's deterrent effect on police violations of Miranda. Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 9 forbade the use of statements obtained in violation of Miranda if the Miranda violation was either intentional or egregious. In such circumstances, there was an unacceptable diminishment of the salutary function of the exclusionary rule. The police were not allowed to make violation of Miranda a tactic, nor should the State be allowed to profit from a Miranda violation that no reasonable police officer would have committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge expressly found that defendant's attorney knowingly violated the duty of disclosure under Alaska R.

The reviewing court found no error. The court deferred to the trial court's findings of fact. The judge was entitled to consider restriction or exclusion of evidence as a sanction for the discovery violation, and was not required to impose the lesser sanction of a continuance because, in addition to the finding of bad faith, the judge found that a lesser sanction would not cure the prejudice to the State, and that lesser sanctions would not be adequate to ensure future compliance, given that the defense attorney had already procured a lengthy delay of the trial for the announced purpose of making sure that the expert would have a fair opportunity to study the medical records and formulate a report, and then willfully withheld the report. There was also no error under Alaska R. Evid. 404(b) in admitting evidence of a prior conviction for assaulting another infant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence under Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030. At sentencing, the District Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, Alaska, disqualified defendant from driving a commercial motor vehicle for a year under former Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.33.140. Defendant appealed, contending that the statute did not authorize the district court to disqualify him from driving a commercial vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the trial court and on appeal, defendant argued that former Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.33.140 did not authorize the revocation of a commercial driver's license for a conviction of driving under the influence unless the motorist was operating a commercial vehicle at the time of the offense. On review, the court held that former Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.33.140 did not allow the disqualification of a commercial driver's license for a conviction involving a non-commercial motor vehicle. Because Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.33.140(a) and (b) were reasonably susceptible of two contradictory interpretations--one allowing revocation of a commercial license upon a conviction for driving a private vehicle while under the influence and a second allowing revocation only if the conviction for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence was committed while driving a commercial vehicle--the statute was ambiguous. Under the rule of lenity, resolution of the ambiguity required adoption of the meaning most favorable to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the district court judgment disqualifying defendant from driving a commercial motor vehicle was vacated. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Palmer (Alaska), granted in part defendant's motion to suppress his pre-Miranda warning statements, an officer's first interview that occurred after defendant asserted his right to silence, and defendant's statements made during booking. Nonetheless, a jury found defendant guilty of assault in the first degree, a class A felony, under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.200(a)(1) and (b). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not make any significantly incriminating statements prior to being given Miranda warnings. Thus, a police officer's subsequent full advisement of Miranda warnings was sufficient to dissipate any taint from those pre-Miranda warning statements. Defendant exercised his right to remain silent. However, the officer returned to his holding cell about a half hour later and began to question defendant again. The appellate court found that the officer scrupulously honored defendant's right to cut off questioning when (1) the officer asked defendant for permission to enter his holding cell and defendant consented; (2) the officer asked defendant whether he remembered his Miranda rights and defendant's response showed that he did recall his right to remain silent; (3) the officer proceeded in the same manner as the earlier interview, allowing defendant to decide, on a question-by-question basis, whether he would answer the officer's inquiries; and (4) defendant agreed to that manner of questioning.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the definition of DUI under Arizona law, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1381(A)(1), was not sufficiently similar to Alaska's definition of DUI, Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030(a), so that defendant's Arizona conviction qualified as a prior conviction in Alaska. The appellate court found that even though the Arizona test may be worded differently, it was essentially the same as the Alaska test. Defendant's DUI convictions from Arizona qualified as prior convictions for purposes of the Alaska felony DUI law. Under Arizona law impairment to the slightest degree meant essentially the same thing as the Gundersen test. Both tests required proof that, because of the influence of intoxicants, the operator of a motor vehicle was deprived to a perceptible degree of their normal mental and physical capacity to control the vehicle. The elements of Arizona's DUI statute were similar to the elements of DUI under Alaska law and, therefore, defendant's prior conviction for violating the Arizona statute qualified as a prior conviction for the purpose of assessing whether he was guilty of felony DUI in Alaska.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury convicted defendant of nine counts arising out of five separate attacks on five women. Defendant had three prior felony convictions. Defendant argued that the superior court improperly speculated that defendant had committed additional uncharged sexual assaults; however, the superior court clarified the record by indicating no reliance was placed on the potential that defendant had other unknown victims. On appeal, defendant argued that the superior court violated the double jeopardy clause when it imposed the same composite term that was originally imposed. The appellate court rejected this claim because the superior court was authorized to impose a composite term that reflected the totality of defendant's misconduct. The parties did not allege any statutory aggravating or mitigating factors, so the superior court was required to impose the presumptive term for each count. The record indicated that the superior court reasonably concluded that defendant was a member of the rare class of offenders who must be incarcerated for the remainder of their life for the protection of the public. The appellate court concluded that defendant's sentence wasnot clearly mistaken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State filed a juvenile delinquency petition against respondent minor, alleging fourth-degree controlled substance misconduct. The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Dillingham (Alaska), affirmed the children's master ruling that denied the minor's request for a jury trial on the ground that it was untimely under Alaska Delinq. R. 21(a) (2000). The minor challenged the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although case law strongly suggested the Alaska Delinq. R. 21(a) (2000) was constitutional, the appellate court did not resolve the issue because the superior court abused its discretion when it denied the minor's request for a jury trial. The right to a jury trial in delinquency proceedings was regulated in the same manner that Alaska R. Civ. P. 38 regulated the constitutional right to a jury trial in civil cases. Under Alaska R. Civ. P. 39(b), a trial judge had the authority to grant a civil litigant's untimely request for a jury trial. Because that rule was consistent with Alaska R. Civ. P. 38, it was also consistent with Alaska Delinq. R. 21(a) (2000). Thus, under Alaska Delinq. R. 1(f) (2000), Alaska R. Civ. P. 39(b) should have been applied when assessing whether to grant the minor's untimely request for a jury trial. The minor's request should have been granted where his original attorney was forced to withdraw, the replacement attorney filed a request shortly after its first appearance for the minor, the time of trial did not cause scheduling or administration problems, and the State conceded that granting the request did not prejudice its prosecution of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was adjudicated a delinquent minor for assaulting a minor victim. The Superior Court, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks (Alaska) ordered the juvenile and his parents to pay restitution to the victim's aunt, who was the victim's guardian and physical custodian, and a mental health counselor who counseled the victim. The juvenile challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.12.120(b)(4), the superior court was obligated to order restitution for the time the victim's aunt missed work because as the victim's effective guardian, she was a victim under Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 47.12.990(16) and 12.55.185(19)(B). The superior court also had authority to order restitution in favor of the mental health counselor because, given the broad authorization for counseling restitution in Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.045(a), suitable restitution in delinquency cases included mental health counseling for victims. The argument that the restitution obligation should have terminated when the juvenile's term of probation ended was rejected as Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.12.170(a) expressly stated that a restitution order remained enforceable after the superior court's juvenile jurisdiction expired. Moreover, the juvenile's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because it was inconsistent with Alaska Delinq. R. 1(c) failed as he had waived the argument by presenting it for the first time in his reply brief. Finally, even if the superior court was obliged to consider the juvenile's ability to pay restitution, it had at least implicitly considered his ability to pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the District Court, First Judicial District, Sitka (Alaska), defendant was prosecuted for illegally catching or retaining herring. Although initially charged with a misdemeanor under Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.723, defendant was ultimately charged with and convicted of a lesser offense under Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.722.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.723 provided misdemeanor penalties (including up to 1 year in jail) for various commercial fishing violations if the State proved that the defendant acted negligently. Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.722 allowed the State to prosecute commercial fishing violations under a strict liability theory, but the only penalties that could be imposed were a fine and a forfeiture of any fish taken as a result of the violation. Defendant argued that the enactment of &sect; 16.05.722 violated the Alaska Constitution's equal protection clause because it denied a defendant the right to a jury trial, but the appellate court held that this denial was justified because a defendant did not face potential imprisonment. The forfeiture of his catch was not cruel and unusual punishment under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 12 because defendant was merely put back in the position that he was in before beginning to fish illegally. The prosecutor's decision to reduce the charges, thus depriving defendant of a jury trial, was not an abuse of discretion because defendant did not show any resulting prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner sought review of a decision of the District Court, Third Judicial District (Alaska), which upheld the determination of appellee Matanuska-Susitna Borough that he operated an &quot;adult cabaret&quot; without a conditional use permit in violation of Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska, Ordinances 17.90.015(A), 17.90.030(A), 17.125.010, and 17.90.005 (ordinances).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bar owner was charged with operating an adult cabaret without a permit for an adult business after a performance by male dancers clothed only in garments resembling athletic supporters. The district court upheld the charge and the ordinances' constitutionality. The owner appealed. The court remanded the case because there was a significant question of whether the pre-2005 version of Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska, Ordinance 17.125.010, which defined adult cabaret as a restaurant that featured topless dancers or strippers who provided live entertainment for commercial purposes, was broad enough to cover bars that offered a single or isolated presentation of live adult entertainment. The court concluded that, if the Borough's definition of adult cabaret was construed to cover the owner's conduct, there was a significant possibility that the ordinances violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 5, which protected erotic dancing, because it was not clear that they left open reasonable alternative venues for presenting sexually oriented entertainment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the district court for further litigation of whether the conduct constituted the operation of an adult cabaret and whether the ordinances violated the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The applicant turned the gun on himself and fired, but his suicide attempt failed. The applicant sustained serious injuries to his face and jaw. The applicant identified two aspects of his attorneys' representation that he claimed constituted ineffective assistance: the attorneys' failure to seek a continuance of the trial until the applicant was able to communicate vocally, and the attorneys' failure to consult with the applicant and investigate his case. During trial, the applicant provided written answers. The trial court noted that the applicant was able to convey emotions through body language, among other things. The applicant was not entitled to post-conviction relief on this basis. The applicant's second claim was deficient because an application must include an affidavit from trial counsel addressing the attorney's alleged deficiency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree theft, which constituted a theft of property valued at more than $ 500.

In his motion to reconsider, which was denied, defendant argued that he did not have the financial ability to pay that amount.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An off-duty police officer saw defendant staggering in a parking lot and driving erratically. The officer followed defendant to a motel. In the motel parking lot, the officer observed that defendant had bloodshot, watery eyes, smelled of alcohol, was swaying, and was slurring his words. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the initial stop by the off-duty officer was not supported by reasonable suspicion, and the trial court abused its discretion in denying a continuance so he could prepare an additional claim. Nevertheless, the initial contact with defendant was not an investigatory stop because the officer simply walked up to defendant in the motel's parking lot. Further, the officer's observations of defendant not only provided reasonable suspicion for a stop, but the officer's observations during the detention provided probable cause. As to the continuance, defendant waited until the morning of trial to ask for a continuance. Defendant had already been granted two continuances and had time to file a motion or request a continuance in the week immediately preceding the trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Fairbanks, Alaska, which convicted him for driving under the influence (DUI) in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised various challenges to the constitutionality of a revised version of &sect; 28.35.030(a)(2). The court had rejected all of these constitutional attacks on the statute in another case, which governed the resolution of defendant's attacks on &sect; 28.35.030(a)(2). Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 28.35.030(s) by arguing that the subsection violated the guarantee of due process of law because it unjustifiably prevented defendants from introducing evidence that was both scientifically valid and relevant to the determination of guilt or innocence. The court noted that defendant was prosecuted under both subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of the DUI statute, that is both under the &quot;under the influence&quot; clause and the &quot;blood alcohol level&quot; clause. There was no reasonable dispute as to defendant's guilt under the &quot;blood alcohol level&quot; clause of &sect; 28.35.030(a)(2). Because of this, even assuming it was constitutional error to prevent defendant from introducing evidence relevant to his guilt or innocence under &sect; 28.35.030(a)(1), that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030, which was amended in 2004, violated due process because it created an impermissible presumption that a motorist was at least as intoxicated at the time of driving as at the time of a chemical test administered within four hours of driving. The court of appeals disagreed. Although a defendant could no longer offer &quot;big gulp&quot; or other &quot;delayed absorption&quot; evidence to show that his chemical test result did not reflect his impairment at the time of driving, the legislature had the authority to redefine the offense in that manner. The legislature wished to discourage motorists from &quot;playing a form of Russian roulette with the driving public&quot; by consuming large amounts of alcohol and then racing the clock to reach their destination before the alcohol was absorbed into their bloodstream and they became too impaired to drive. Prohibiting a &quot;delayed absorption&quot; defense was a reasonable way to deter this conduct. Legislative enactments were presumed to be constitutional, and defendant did not meet his burden to show a violation of due process in his case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly kept the victim confined in a motel room by using alcohol and a muscle relaxant. Defendant was also accused of physically and sexually assaulting the victim. Subsequently, defendant transported the victim to another area where defendant killed the victim. The question on appeal was whether Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.125(a)(3) violated a defendant's right to trial by jury and a defendant's right to demand proof beyond a reasonable doubt because, under the statute, the mandatory sentence hinged on an issue of fact that was decided by a judge using a clear and convincing evidence standard of proof. Under both Apprendi and Blakely, the legislature could deny discretionary parole following conviction for first degree murder, if there was a finding of substantial physical torture of the victim. Also, there was no violation of defendant's right to a jury trial and due process under the state constitution. There was an additional issue presented, however, as to whether defendant was entitled to good time credits. Amendments to Alaska Stat. &sect; 33.20.010(a) that denied good time credit could not be applied because the amendments were enacted after defendant's sentencing dates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mandatory sentence was affirmed; however, defendant was entitled to good time credits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court correctly noted that the procedures specified in the presumptive law for adjudicating aggravating factors violated the right to jury trial announced in Blakely and ruled that these procedures were so crucial to the overall functioning of presumptive sentencing that they could not be severed or amended by judicial decision. On appeal, the court concluded that these constitutionally flawed procedures could be replaced by jury trial procedures that conformed to the requirements of Blakely without destroying the essential functioning and purpose of Alaska's presumptive sentencing scheme. The legislature retained the basic framework of presumptive sentencing, including the same scheme of aggravating factors and mitigating factors--but with the proviso that many of these aggravating factors would be litigated to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt a provided in Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155(f).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner husband was charged by respondent State with fourth-degree assault on his wife. After more than two years, the husband was still awaiting trial. Pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.30.027(b), one of the conditions of the husband's pre-trial release, which was imposed by the District Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, Alaska, forbade the husband from returning to the residence he shared with his wife and daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several weeks after the husband's pre-trial release, the husband sought to modify his release conditions. The husband argued that the release condition violated the equal protection clause of the federal and state constitutions because it burdened the liberty interests of individuals who pose no danger to the alleged victim. He also argued that his right to procedural due process was violated because he was deprived of a fundamental liberty interest without the opportunity for a meaningful hearing. The appellate court agreed that &sect; 12.30.027(b) violated Alaska's guarantee of equal protection under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The statute eliminated all judicial discretion to permit a person charged with a crime involving domestic violence to return to the family residence. Moreover, the category of &quot;crime involving domestic violence&quot; included many crimes that had nothing to do with physical assault committed by one domestic partner upon another. Parties who were charged with, but not yet convicted of, a crime involving domestic violence retained an important liberty interest in choosing their family living arrangements. Further, less restrictive alternatives were available.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the decision of the district court. The appellate court remanded the case for a hearing and new findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police found physical evidence tending to prove defendant was engaged in the commercial cultivation of marijuana.

The appellate court noted that the judicial officers relied on pre-Crocker law when they assessed whether there was probable cause. The decisions made by judicial officers were reasonable at the time, and their actions were in good faith. The appellate court concluded that the restriction on search warrants announced in Crocker should not be applied retroactively. Defendant raised a number of challenges to marijuana laws. Nevertheless, defendant ignored stare decisis in his argument, and the appellate court rejected defendant's attack on Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.71.040(a)(3)(F). There was no constitutional right to buy or sell marijuana. As to defendant's sentence, the trial court was entitled to consider all the evidence when imposing the sentence.

In July 2004, the inmate filed for postconviction relief after the Court of Appeals of Alaska issued a decision in Noy that ruled that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.71.060, penalizing certain marijuana possession crimes, violated the privacy clause set forth in Alaska Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, defendants sought review of judgments of the Superior Court, First Judicial District, Ketchikan (Alaska) that imposed enhanced sentences based on aggravating factors under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155. The question presented by the appeals was whether defendants' right to jury trial, as recognized in Blakely v. Washington, should be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State claimed that state courts were required to follow the Teague retroactivity test in deciding the potential retroactive application of a new rule of federal law, such as the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial announced in Blakely v. Washington.  The court found that the United States Supreme Court's underlying aim in Teague v. Lane was to impose equitable restrictions on the federal courts' exercise of their authority under the Federal Habeas Corpus Act to review state criminal convictions; thus the Teague retroactivity test limited federal courts, not state courts. Accordingly, the court held that it was not bound by federal law to apply the Teague retroactivity test when deciding whether the Blakely rule should be applied retroactively. Rather, the court held that it was bound to apply the retroactivity test adopted by the Alaska Supreme Court; and that under that test, the Blakely rule requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt should be applied retroactively to all state defendants, including those whose convictions were already final when Blakely was decided. Also under Blakely, defendants had a right to demand that aggravators be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Blakely rule must be applied retroactively, affirmed the trial court decision as to one defendant, but reversed the decision as to the other with respect to the trial court's aggravator finding because the aggravator finding was based on the clear and convincing standard, rather than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. The court remanded the case to the trial court for renewed proceedings on that aggravator.</SPAN></P>

Because the officers had a warrant for the son's arrest, because they knew that the son resided with defendants at their home, and because they had probable cause to believe that the son was currently within that residence, the officers acted lawfully when they entered the residence to arrest the son.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After observing defendant violating several traffic laws, a police officer pulled him over. He was charged with several offenses, including felony driving under the influence. Defendant's motion to suppress was denied, and he was convicted. In affirming, the appellate court held that the stop was justified because the police officer's testimony regarding defendant's violations was more credible. Proof that the breath test machine had not been calibrated when it was first certified under Alaska Admin. Code tit. 13, &sect;&nbsp;63.100 had little relevancy to the accuracy of the machine on the date of defendant's breath test. Also, the trial judge was not mistaken in imposing consecutive sentences because the crimes violated different societal interests within the meaning of former Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.025 (2002). The trial judge was permitted to exceed the recommendations of a presentence report under Alaska R. Crim. P. 32.1(b)(1) based on defendant's lengthy criminal history. Finally, Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030(n) did not violate U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;10 or Alaska Const. art.

The Superior Court of the Third Judicial District, Anchorage, Alaska, agreed with defendant and discharged the jury. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended the trial court erred in dismissing the jury and setting a sentencing date to determine the applicable presumptive term, arguing, inter alia, that defendant did not have a right to grand jury indictment on any aggravating factor listed in Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155(c). Defendant argued that the trial judge's resolution of this matter was mandated by the double jeopardy clause of the federal and state constitutions. The appellate court concluded that even thought U.S. Const. amend. VI, as interpreted in Blakely, guaranteed defendant the right to jury trial on an aggravating factor listed in &sect; 12.55.155(c), that aggravating factor was not an element of defendant's crime for purposes of the grand jury clause of Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The appellate court also concluded that, under the facts of defendant's case, a second jury trial addressed to the aggravator under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155(c)(5) would not violate the guarantee against successive prosecutions embodied in the double jeopardy clause of the federal and state constitutions as a new jury trial on aggravating circumstances was not a second prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court to allow the parties to litigate the State's proposed aggravating factor before defendant was sentenced for manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that the term &quot;preliminary&quot; used in Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.031(b) referred to the timing of the test, not the device on which the test was performed. Nor did it specify that a device used for a test could only be used for a &quot;preliminary&quot; test and no other purpose. Defendant did not show that the statute provided that a breath test administered with a portable device was exclusively a &quot;preliminary breath test,&quot; nor did she identify legislative history that restricted the use of portable devices to preliminary tests. The language in .031(d) did not limit the use of a portable device to assisting decisions about whether to arrest an individual. Approval of a specific test by the Department of Public Safety only affected whether that test enjoyed a statutory presumption of validity under Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.033(d).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, Alaska, convicted defendant of first-degree vehicle theft, felony driving under the influence, and felony refusal to submit to a breath test. The superior court ruled that the pre-2005 presumptive sentencing law was so constitutionally flawed it had to be thrown out, leaving a scheme of indeterminate sentencing specified in Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.125(c), (d), (e), and (i). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that the aggravator under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155(c)(8) was established by defendant's seven prior convictions for assault and that aggravator (c)(21) was established by his twelve prior convictions for driving under the influence. Defendant had argued that Blakely did not allow the State to rely on these prior convictions to establish the (c)(8) and (c)(21) aggravators without submitting those aggravators to a jury. The appellate court determined that, consistent with Blakely, the State could use defendant's undisputed prior convictions to prove aggravators (c)(8) and (c)(21) without the need to submit these aggravators to a jury. To the extent that the trial judge believed that the pre-2005 presumptive sentencing law had to be thrown out, the fact remained that defendant had not shown that he had been prejudiced by the sentencing law's departure from Blakely. Because defendant did not show that his Sixth Amendment rights were being violated by application of the pre-2005 sentencing law to him, the trial judge's ruling amounted to an advisory opinion on an issue that was not presented by defendant's case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated, and the superior court was ordered to sentence defendant under the pre-2005 statutes, modifying any procedures as necessary to comply with Blakely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with third-degree misconduct involving a controlled substance (possession of cocaine) and resisting arrest. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence under the Fourth Amendment. The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, Alaska, denied the motion. Defendant entered a plea to third-degree misconduct involving a controlled substance, and he pleaded no contest to resisting arrest. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several police officers went to a hotel room looking for the occupant and his cohort, who both had arrest warrants. Ultimately, the officers did not arrest either the occupant or the cohort; instead, they arrested defendant. The issue on appeal, under the Fourth Amendment and Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 14, was whether the police had probable cause to believe that a subject of the warrant was in the hotel; in other words, whether the information developed by the officers established a fair probability or substantial chance that either the occupant or his cohort was present in the room. Although the officers used a ruse to convince the occupants to open the door, the officers were in uniform and immediately announced their presence when the door was opened. Under the circumstances, the trial court properly found that the officers had a legitimate concern for officer safety. Furthermore, the appellate court agreed with the trial court's finding that the &quot;knock and announce&quot; requirement of Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.25.100 and Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.35.040 did not apply because the police did not use their authority under the warrants to force their way into the room.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After Matanuska-Susitna, Alaska, Borough Code &sect; 8.52.015(A) was enacted, defendant was charged with several violations of the noise ordinance. He was convicted, and later sought appellate review. In affirming, the reviewing court rejected the argument that the ordinance was overbroad because it limited amplified noise during too many hours of the day and night. The government was not required to choose the least restrictive means available, and defendant offered no basis for finding that the time of day limitations reached substantially more conduct than necessary to achieve the government's goal. Next, the reviewing court rejected defendant's vagueness challenge as well. The ordinance placed specific geographic and time limitations on the noise, and it was not vague merely because the question of reasonableness was judicially determined. The trial court did not err by denying a continuance because it could have concluded that no discovery violation had been committed; moreover, defendant failed to show any prejudice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, before the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Palmer, Alaska, of sexual abuse of a minor in the first degree. At his sentencing, defendant argued that requiring him to register as a sex offender would violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws under both the Alaska and the United States Constitutions. The superior court judge agreed. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a series of pleadings asking the superior court to vacate its earlier order and enter an order requiring defendant to comply with the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act (ASORA), Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.63, which required defendant to register as a sex offender. The superior court denied the State's request. The appellate court concluded that the superior court erred to the extent that it failed to grant prospective rescission of that order. The appellate court noted that when the superior court judge entered her order, the superior court judge concluded that requiring defendant to register as a sex offender constituted punishment for his crime. Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court had concluded that ASORA was a civil regulatory scheme that did not constitute punishment for a crime. Therefore, with legal hindsight, the superior court's order was in error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the offense of driving a motor vehicle on a highway at a time when his license was revoked, in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.15.291(a). Defendant ultimately pleaded no contest to this charge, but he reserved his right to argue on appeal that, even when a person's driver's license had been revoked, &sect; 28.15.291(a) did not prohibit that person from driving an all-terrain vehicle on a highway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's license was revoked following a conviction for driving under the influence. Police later saw defendant driving a four-wheeled all-terrain vehicle on a highway. At issue on appeal was whether, following the suspension or revocation of a driver's license, the statute prohibited a person from driving any motor vehicle on a highway, even if the motor vehicle was of a type for which no license was required. Defendant argued that &sect; 28.15.291(a) was impliedly amended in a manner that overturned the construction of the statute in earlier jurisprudence. After an examination of the legislative history, however, the appellate court rejected this argument. Further, a mistake of law defense was not available. The appellate court noted that even if it agreed with defendant that &sect; 28.15.291(a) should not apply to all types of license cancellations, suspensions, and revocations, defendant's license revocation would still fall within the undisputably lawful core of the statute. The appellate court also rejected defendant's equal protection and due process attacks on &sect; 28.15.291(a). There was a rational basis for the distinction created, and the statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A municipality had enacted laws that, read together, prohibited the possession and sale of items connected with the manufacturing, dispensing, storing, and use of controlled substances. The trial court read Anchorage, Alaska, Mun. Code 08.35.010(A) and (B) in a way to make them pass constitutional muster. Defendant then sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the laws were vague because the definition of drug paraphernalia was not easily understood or applied. In addition, people could have been convicted of a crime without any proof that they acted with a culpable mental state, which constituted a violation of due process. Also, the laws outlawed the sale or possession of items connected with the manufacturing, dispensing, storing, and use of controlled substances, regardless of whether that conduct was lawful or unlawful. This drafting error, if it had been the only error, could have been resolved by adopting a limited construction of the laws.

In his no contest plea, he preserved two issues for appeal. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The privacy provision of Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 22 protected the right of an adult to possess a small amount of marijuana in his home for personal use. Defendant contended that, because the plants he possessed totaled only a little over two ounces of marijuana, prosecution of his case contravened state caselaw. The legislature had the power to set reasonable limits on the amount of marijuana that people could possess for personal use in their homes. Thus, the criminalization of the possession of 25 or more marijuana plants, regardless of the weight of the marijuana in its processed form, did not conflict with the state caselaw. Because defendant had 43 live marijuana plants in his home, his conviction was appropriate. Also, the troopers' actions in entering defendant's home without a warrant were reasonable under the emergency aid doctrine because a dispatch reported gunshots and yelling coming from a red house, a gentleman on that road directed them to a red house, loud music was playing, the door was open, and there was no response to the announcement that they were state troopers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, defendant's best friend, was found dead in his car. Defendant told police several different versions of the events that lead to the victim's death, one of the stories being that he shot the victim by accident. The court affirmed, and held that the judge's supplemental instruction regarding the definition of &quot;extreme indifference to the value of human life&quot; was proper because it was drawn directly from the examples contained in the legislative commentary to Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.110(a)(2), as was approved in Johnson. The court also held that defendant was not entitled under Apprendi to have a jury decide whether his sentence should exceed the Page benchmark range of 20 to 30 years. Under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.125(b), second-degree murder carried a range of punishment of 5 to 99 years' imprisonment, and within that range, sentencing was indeterminate, and the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial did not apply to a sentencing judge's decision to impose a sentence that exceeded the Page benchmark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the decision in Blakely v. Washington restricted the trial judge's authority to impose consecutive sentences exceeding the prescribed presumptive term for his most serious offense or the maximum term for his most serious offense. The appellate court noted that the issue on appeal was whether the fact finding called for by the Neal-Mutschler rule- -that before a sentencing judge imposed consecutive sentences that totalled more than the maximum sentence for a defendant's most serious offense, the judge had to expressly find that the total sentence was necessary to protect the public- -was subject to the procedural requirements of Blakely. The appellate court held that the Neal-Mutschler rule did not increase the potential sentence a defendant could receive beyond the statutory range of potential sentences already specified by the legislature; therefore, where a sentencing judge applied the Neal-Mutschler rule to assess whether a composite incarcerative term exceeding the maximum term for that defendant's single most serious crime was necessary to protect the public, the sentencing judge was not required to submit the issue to a jury in accordance with Blakely.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving several complaints, Alaskan state troopers contacted Michigan law enforcement for assistance. A Michigan law enforcement agent contacted defendant, who did not have a license, about guiding a hunting trip. A moose and bear were both shot on the trip; defendant used a boat in the process. The Michigan agent paid defendant a fee. On appeal, defendant argued that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to move the trial to Bethel. He also argued that the State did not prove that he received any compensation for his guiding services. He also argued that there was prejudice caused by the State's long delay in charging him with these offenses. As to the venue, defendant failed to meet the requirements of Alaska Stat. &sect; 22.15.080 by failing to show specifically how the ends of justice were impeded. Evidence was sufficient to show defendant received compensation; there was no merit to defendant's claim that the trial court plainly erred by not requiring the jury to calculate the precise costs of the hunt. Finally, defendant failed to show prejudice by the pre-trial delay because defendant did not show how a deceased witness's testimony would have helped him. .</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent juvenile was convicted as an adult in the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Naknek, Alaska, of murder in the second degree, manslaughter, kidnaping, first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, second-degree theft, and tampering with physical evidence. Thereafter, respondent filed a motion to return jurisdiction to the juvenile court, which the trial court granted. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent argued that the Alaska juvenile waiver procedure was unconstitutional as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v. Washington. Specifically, he contended that under Blakely, the decision about whether he was amenable to treatment as a juvenile had to be made by a jury, not by a judge, and that the jury had to make that finding under a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court noted that, pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.12.100, a trial judge was to waive juvenile jurisdiction if, after a hearing, he or she found probable cause to believe that the minor committed offenses that would have been criminal if committed by an adult and that the minor was not amenable to treatment as a juvenile. The appellate court held that Apprendi did not apply to a juvenile waiver proceeding because it was not a sentencing proceeding, but rather a determination of the court's jurisdiction. The appellate court concluded that juvenile waiver hearings were not sentencing proceedings and therefore were not governed by Apprendi, and that the reasoning of various cases appeared to foreshadow that courts would not arrive at a different decision following Blakely.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 12.55.125(k)(2) meant that when a judge was sentencing a first felony offender for a class B or a class C felony, defendant's time to serve could equal, but not exceed, the presumptive term that would apply to a second felony offender convicted of the same crime. Even without proof of any aggravating factors, the judge was authorized to impose the sentence that defendant received and his Blakely argument was moot.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defense and the State agreed that the pre-sentence report would incorporate both the victim's version and defendant's version. The court held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.125(k)(2) superseded the Austin / Brezenoff rule. As defendant's attorney told the judge during a discussion of sentencing matters, even in the absence of aggravating factors, the Austin rule would have authorized the judge to sentence defendant to an unsuspended term of two years minus one day. That is, &sect; 12.55.125(k)(2) increased the authorized amount of unsuspended incarceration by a single day in that it allowed the judge to impose an unsuspended term of two years. Further, the court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to the statute. Therefore, even without proof of any aggravating factors, the judge was authorized to impose the sentence that defendant received. Defendant's Blakely argument was therefore moot. The plea bargain went forward only after defendant's attorney expressly agreed that the judge could decide the disputed aggravating factors based on the content of the pre-sentence report and the police reports, without requiring live testimony from the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Kenai (Alaska), which denied appellant's petition for writ of habeas corpus contesting his extradition on drug charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor of Alaska issued a warrant for the arrest and extradition of appellant to face felony drug charges in Montana. The Montana charges were based on an affidavit of probable cause that was sworn to before a notary public. Appellant contended that the affidavit was insufficient to support his extradition because it was not sworn to before a judicial officer. The court rejected appellant's argument, observing that the three possible methods for supporting an extradition request were specified disjunctively in Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.70.020(a)(2). Thus, the requirement of the third alternative that an affidavit be made before a magistrate did not apply to an affidavit that supported an information. The court also held that 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3182, which provided that the executive authority of any state could demand the extradition of a fugitive found in another state when the demanding state produced a copy of an indictment found or an affidavit made before a magistrate, did not require that an affidavit supporting an information be executed before a magistrate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska) of first-degree robbery, evidence tampering, and fourth-degree controlled substance misconduct. Defendant appealed the robbery conviction and the sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his sentence violated Blakley. The court of appeals agreed. The two Blakely violations were that the disputed aggravator was resolved by the sentencing judge, and that the sentencing judge applied the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof instead of requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The issue of whether defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance required the finder of fact first to assess the extent of his physical incapacity and then to assess the victim's physical ability to resist in comparison to the physical ability of a typical robbery victim. Both of those assessments turned on matters of degree. Thus, the ultimate conclusions as to whether the victim was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance to armed robbery, and whether defendant knew or reasonably should have known that, could easily have been affected by the identity of the fact finder (judge versus jury) and could easily have been affected by the State's burden of proof (clear and convincing evidence versus beyond a reasonable doubt).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant bit his girlfriend in the face. Thereafter, he was convicted of second-degree assault under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.210(a)(2). Defendant then sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the scar was a &quot;serious and protracted disfigurement&quot;; therefore, the injury was a &quot;serious physical injury&quot; as defined in Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.81.900(b)(56)(B). The court relied on the decision in City of Bethel, which was a civil case. Under that analysis, a visible scar constituted a disfigurement for purposes of Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.17.010(c). A reasonable juror could have concluded that the scar was a type of disfigurement that was both &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;protracted.&quot; A &quot;serious&quot; injury was one that marred a victim's physical appearance and caused a degree of unattractiveness sufficient to bring negative attention or embarrassment. Further, a &quot;protracted&quot; disfigurement did not have to be permanent. The victim's scar was not transient or temporary, but remained serious even after a reasonable healing period. Finally, the trial court properly admitted evidence of prior assaults under Alaska R. Evid. 404(b) to rebut the argument of self-defense.</SPAN></P>

Defendants successfully moved for dismissal, arguing that the probation provision of Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.16.050 violated Alaska's equal protection law because the provision required younger offenders to stay on probation longer than older offenders. The appellate court noted that in light of the State's interest in preventing the health and social problems that were associated with underage drinking and because the younger offenders were more at risk than were older offenders, the legislature could properly decide that the State and the courts would monitor younger offenders longer than older offenders. The appellate court held that the challenged provision had a substantial relationship to the legislature's goal of preventing unlawful underage drinking and did not, by placing all minors convicted of illegally consuming or possessing alcohol on probation for one year or until they turn 21, whichever was longer, violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

After driving the victim around town, they forced the victim to have sex, hit her with an ax handle, shot her, and buried her in the snow. On appeal, the applicant claimed that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failing to seek advanced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing. Based on the record before it, the appellate court could not determine if the applicant was entitled to relief. The applicant would be required to show: (1) that his conviction rested primarily on eyewitness identification evidence, (2) that there was a demonstrable doubt concerning the applicant's identification as the perpetrator, and (3) that scientific testing would likely be conclusive on this issue. The appellate court concluded that it was not clear that the applicant could meet this three-part test. In addition, the superior court was required to consider whether, even assuming that the applicant met this test, his claim was nevertheless barred by the twin statutory limitations codified in Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.72.020(b)(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court, Third Judicial District, Dillingham (Alaska), convicted defendant of seven fish and game violations related to taking two moose and one brown bear. The trial judge imposed a composite sentence of six days to serve, $ 20,000 in fines, and $ 3,300 in restitution. The trial judge placed defendant on probation for six years and also revoked his hunting license for six years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper cited defendant for taking a brown bear in closed season. The trooper subsequently learned that defendant was not an Alaska resident. That information ultimately led to his convictions for seven fish and game violations. Defendant alleged that the definition of &quot;take&quot; in Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.940(34) violated his substantive due process rights. However, defendant could not reasonably claim that pursuing a bear and shooting at it for reasons other than defense of life or property was constitutionally protected conduct that the legislature had no authority to regulate. Thus, even assuming that the statutory definition of &quot;take&quot; in &sect; 16.05.940(34) presented constitutional issues at its periphery, defendant's conduct could not reasonably be characterized as constitutionally protected. Also, the appellate court found that the fines of $ 20,000 were not improper because (1) the fines were justified to deter defendant and others from similar offenses; and (2) defendant would have spent more than $ 20,000 over the years if he had hunted legally by purchasing nonresident hunting licenses and tags and hiring registered guides when required by statute to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing matched crime scene evidence to defendant's DNA type, shared by up to 16 percent of African-Americans. The appellate court held defendant did not show his counsel was ineffective by not seeking more definitive testing. Counsel tactically decided not to seek such testing as she felt it could definitively link defendant to the crime scene. This tactical decision, which was one for counsel to make, was presumed sound. Defendant claimed a due process right to retest the evidence to show his innocence, but he had no federal due process right to present new evidence of factual innocence. He could, however, have had the trial court consider if he showed (1) his conviction rested mainly on eyewitness identification, (2) there was a demonstrable doubt about his identification as the perpetrator, and (3) scientific testing would likely be conclusive. If he showed these elements but his claim was barred by Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.72.020(b)(2), requiring new evidence to be truly new or newly discovered and diligently pursued, the trial court had to consider if the Alaska Constitution's due process clause allowed defendant to pursue the claim, nonetheless.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected defendant's argument that pre-indictment delay prejudiced him. Defendant made only generalized claims of faded memories which were insufficient to indicate prejudice. The use of a prior inconsistent statement of one of the victims when she did not remember the things she intended to testify to was not error. The statements were admissible under Alaska R. Evid. 801(d)(1). The court held that the jury's verdict acquitting defendant of one charge against one victim but convicting him of another was not inconsistent; the evidence was stronger for the latter than the former charge. Defendant's sentence of 10 years to serve fell properly within the recommended range of 10-15 years.</SPAN></P>

Because defendant's offense was a felony &quot;crime against a person&quot; under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41, he was asked to provide a sample of his DNA for inclusion in Alaska's DNA database.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Citing privacy concerns, a defendant convicted of first-degree assault refused to provide a DNA sample. He contended that the DNA collection statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 44.41.035(b) and 11.56.760(a), unlawfully infringed his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. The court found that defendant failed to rebut the presumptive constitutionality of the DNA collection statute. Therefore, the statute was upheld. An earlier version of Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 44.41.035(b) that required DNA samples from those convicted of felonies against a person, while at the same time not requiring DNA samples from people convicted of other equally serious felonies, did not violate the equal protection clause.

Defendant was arrested for a parole violation, and, during a search incident to arrest, drugs were found on his person. A later motion to suppress the evidence was denied, and defendant was convicted of fourth-degree controlled substances misconduct. In reversing, the court determined that, under Alaska law, officers were permitted to conduct an investigatory stop only if they had reasonable suspicion that imminent public danger existed or that serious harm to persons or property had recently occurred. The investigatory stop was not justified by a reasonable suspicion that defendant was about to drive a car. There was no imminent danger because defendant was about to take a cab. The officers could not base their reasonable suspicion on the fact that defendant might have driven a car later. The court declined to determine whether or not the stop was justified based on a reasonable suspicion that a parole violation had occurred since there was no imminent danger shown.

Rather, it was defendant's burden to show that this conceivable legal problem actually affected defendant's case and potentially undermined the validity of the conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's attack on his prior convictions was based on the Alaska Supreme Court's decision in Williford v. State. At the time that Williford was litigated, former Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030(a), the statute defining the offense of driving while intoxicated, had three clauses. Defendant's two prior convictions were entered in 1982 and 1983, when the Alaska DWI statute contained that invalid subsection (a)(3). Defendant argued that, because that portion of the statute was declared unconstitutional, the appellate court had to conclusively presume that his prior convictions were invalid. The appellate court held that defendant's arguments faltered on the fact that his two prior DWI convictions were not prosecuted under that statute, but rather under the Anchorage DWI ordinance, former Anchorage, Alaska, Mun. Code &sect; 9.28.020(B). Even construing Williford in the light most favorable to defendant, the most that could be said was that, when the supreme court declared that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030(a)(3) was unconstitutionally vague, it expressly declined to rule on the constitutionality of statutes worded like the Anchorage ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in its sentence. The court of appeals disagreed. In spite of a domestic violence restraining order, defendant went into the house with the intention of confronting the victim. The trial court found that defendant &quot;lost it&quot; and terrorized the victim for hours. Defendant had previously been convicted of violating a domestic violence restraining order and, in the present offense, had done so again. The trial court found that defendant's current offenses were particularly serious. The trial court found that defendant was unrepentant. The victim testified at the sentencing hearing and was understandably concerned about what might happen to her after defendant was released from confinement. She asked the trial court, in light of her fears, to sentence defendant to a maximum sentence. Rather than impose a maximum sentence, the trial court chose to have defendant under supervised probation for an extended period of time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest to three felonies as part of a plea bargain. He later sought permission to withdraw his plea. The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska) ruled that defendant had failed to present a fair and just reason for withdrawing his pleas. The Court of Appeals of Alaska affirmed. Defendant sought rehearing of the appellate court's decision regarding the plea withdrawal and of sentencing issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court judge concluded that defendant's decision to plead no contest was not materially influenced by defendant's mistaken understanding concerning the consequences of winning the suppression motion. The appellate court's task was to determine whether the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing supported the judge's decision. The appellate court held that the assertions of fact contained in defendant's petition for rehearing concerning his reasons for accepting the plea bargain were never presented to the trial court and were not supported by the record. Defendant's petition was denied on that issue. However, the appellate court agreed with defendant that his private creation and private possession of sexual images of his 17-year-old girlfriend constituted conduct among the least serious within the definition of exploitation of a minor, and possession of child pornography, Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 11.41.455(a) and 11.61.127(a), respectively. The judge's decision to the contrary was clearly erroneous. The judge also imposed an illegal sentence on the child pornography count because the state had not proven any aggravators under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed. The sentences for exploitation of a minor and for possession of child pornography were vacated. The superior court was to resentence defendant .</SPAN></P>
