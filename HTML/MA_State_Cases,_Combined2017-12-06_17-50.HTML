<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former city employee appealed the judgment of the Superior Court Department, Suffolk (Massachusetts), which decided on a motion for summary judgment that he was not entitled to repayment of withheld pay for the period he was under suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was suspended without pay from the Boston police department due to a pending indictment. Later the district attorney's office filed a nolle prosequi. In the meantime, however, a federal grand jury returned indictments charging the employee with several drug offenses for which the employee pleaded guilty and was sentenced. The employee resigned from the police force the same day and thereafter demanded his withheld pay for the period he was under suspension. On appeal, the appellate court noted the governing statute was Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268A, &sect; 25, which provided for the suspension of municipal officers or employees who were under indictment for misconduct while in office. The appellate court concluded the city was bound by the mandate of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268A, &sect; 25, to restore the withheld pay because the initial charges were terminated without a finding or verdict of guilt. As to the period for which the employee was to receive his back pay, the appellate court determined the employee was to be paid from the date he was placed on suspension to the day the federal indictments were returned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the judgment and directed that a new judgment was to be entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was adjudicated a delinquent for various sex offenses. Upon his release from his commitment, he registered as a sex offender, but did not reside at the address he gave. The appellate court found, at the time defendant registered under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect; 178E, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect;&sect; 178I and 178J provided his identification as a sex offender would be publicly disseminated. No pre-registration or pre-dissemination proceeding was provided to determine if defendant was likely to reoffend. Procedural due process entitled defendant to a prior administrative determination, through either a hearing or proper regulation, of whether he was the kind of likely recidivist to whom the statutory registration and notification features were directed, before information about him was publicly disseminated. He did not waive an objection to registering when he registered. The statute was not self-effectuating, nor was it the role of the courts to anticipate whether defendant would be administratively found to be required to register. Defendant could not be convicted for failing to abide by the invalid registration requirement in effect at the time he registered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner filed an action against defendant department and others seeking relief in the nature of certiorari and a declaratory judgment after being found guilty of spitting in a correctional officer's face. Defendants moved to dismiss or, alternatively, for summary judgment. The motion was allowed. The prisoner moved for reconsideration. The Suffolk Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) denied the motion. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner argued that the department regulations governing confinement to the department disciplinary unit (DDU) violated the equal protection and due process guarantees of the United States Constitution and the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, and that the regulations as applied contravened his rights under the Equal Rights Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution. As to the due process claim, the appeals court noted that the disparities in the sanctions could legitimately exist because of the variables involved in an offender's past history. Thus, the regulations and undisputed fact formed a sufficient basis for granting summary judgment on the due process claim. As to the equal protection claim, the appeals court found error in the trial court's grant of summary judgment. The court noted that the mere assertion of separate security characteristics and disciplinary systems for male and female prisoners did not suffice to explain why DDU regulations were not selectively applied to males with a discriminatory purpose, and therefore did not suffice to negate the prisoner's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, voice and data communication microwave transmission services provider, sued defendants, long-distance telephone company, their incorporators, and related entities, for breach of a service agreement. A Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) judgment, inter alia, denied defendants' counterclaims, declared the provider's performance was illegal and certain of defendants' money transfers were proper. The provider appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provider was not in breach of the service agreement by not filing and receiving federal and state tariff rate approval. When the agreement was made, the provider was a nondominant, not a common, carrier and was and not required to file a tariff request. The FCC's Fourth report had forbid nondominant carrier's from filing tariffs. The later MCI case was not to be applied retroactively to require a tariff filing by a nondominant carrier. Defendants' failure to appeal FCC decisions that indicated the FCC was not going to require tariff filings also precluded defendants' claims under res judicata principles. The provider, as a private contract carrier, was not required to obtain Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities' rate approval. Therefore, the provider was not precluded from pursuing its breach of contract claims. The appeals court, in addition to several money transfers between defendants, also found several other transfers were violative of The Massachusetts Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, formerly Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A. Therefore, certain defendants were required to return those funds to the telephone company or make those funds available to the provider.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court reversed the part of the judgment declaring that the provider's performance under the service agreement was illegal, and that certain fund transfers by the telephone company to the incorporators in repayment of certain loans was proper. The appeals court affirmed the remainder of the judgment and remanded the case to the superior court for further proceedings on the issue of damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over defendant's objection, the trial court instructed the jury it was not to mention or consider in any way whatsoever, either for or against either side, that there was no evidence of a breathalyzer. The trial court explained that it was important to make clear to the jury that it was not to speculate about the absence of breathalyzer evidence. On appeal, defendant argued that the instruction violated his Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 12 privilege against self-incrimination. The appellate court noted that, without some form of a limiting instruction, the jury might have relied on common knowledge and engaged in the same speculation invited by the erroneous instruction that was required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(1)(e), which had been found unconstitutional. Unlike the impermissible instruction of &sect; 24(1)(e), the trial judge's limiting instruction did not mention defendant's legal right to refuse to take the breathalyzer or the possible reasons for any refusal. Accordingly, the trial judge's instruction did not violate defendant's Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 12 rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurer, a workers' compensation insurance carrier, appealed from an amended decision of the Industrial Accident Reviewing Board (Massachusetts) ordering the insurer to pay a substantial penalty for its failure to make a timely payment to defendant employee pursuant to a lump sum agreement. The employee moved to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee and the insurer entered a lump sum settlement agreement. Four days after approval of the settlement but 10 days prior to the final date for payment thereunder without penalty, the legislature amended Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 152, &sect; 8(1), thereby providing a statutory penalty for a late payment and superseding the regulatory penalty previously imposed by Mass. Regs. Code tit. 452, &sect; 1.05(5) (1990). The insurer failed to make payment as required on or before January 3, 1992. Instead, it made the required payment of on January 16, 1992. Subsequently, it paid an additional $ 200 pursuant to the statutory penalty provision that had taken effect December 24, 1991. The insurer asserted that the statutory penalty controlled because the event to which that penalty applied, i.e., the failure to make a timely payment, occurred on January 3, 1992. The court agreed. Thus, no considerations of retroactivity were invoked. The statutory penalty did not contemplate a penalty on the penalty, and the insurer satisfied its obligation thereunder by the payment of $ 200 to the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's motion to dismiss the appeal was denied. The amended decision of the board was reversed. The case was remanded for entry of an order in favor of the insurer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's rights had been terminated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Middlesex.  Civil action commenced in the Superior Court Department on August 11, 1997. The case was heard by Isaac Borenstein, J., on a motion to dismiss.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Dismissal of counts VI, IX, and X of the complaint reversed and those counts remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings. Dismissal of the remaining counts affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property in question was taken by eminent domain. The action, seeking to rescind the eminent domain taking on various grounds, followed. Defendant Massachusetts Turnpike Authority filed a motion to dismiss, contending that plaintiffs' complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Superior Court Department, Middlesex (Massachusetts) granted the motion, and plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed that defendant's taking was arbitrary and capricious, because the property was not suitable for a park and ride facility, and was taken with full knowledge that the property would not be so suitable. A park and ride facility served the public by providing a meeting place where commuters could park their cars and travel together in a single car for the remaining duration of their commute. Plaintiffs had no hope of showing that a park and ride facility was beyond the scope of the enabling legislation, 1952 Mass. Acts ch. 354, &sect; 5, as amended through 1980 Mass. Acts ch. 49. Even under the generous reading of a complaint urged by Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a complaint alleging bad faith was held inadequate unless accompanied by some allegations of specific fact supporting the general allegation. Plaintiffs' complaint satisfied the specificity requirement and thus survived the motion to dismiss. Even if the allegations seemed implausible, they provided sufficient factual support for the claims of bad faith, improper purpose, and arbitrary and capricious use of the eminent domain power to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the judgment dismissing the counts of the complaint alleging that the taking was made in bad faith and for ulterior motives. Dismissal of the remaining counts of the complaint was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, in the District Court Department, Woburn Division, Middlesex (Massachusetts), of violating the Massachusetts wiretap statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 99, by secretly taping a meeting with his lawyers. He argued that the statute did not reach conduct protected by privilege.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant secretly recorded a meeting at which he browbeat the lawyers then representing him and threatened to report them to the board of overseers. His eventual complaint evidenced the existence of a tape, and many lawsuits ensued, including a prosecution for violating the wiretap statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 99, which prohibited interception of oral communication without consent. Defendant argued on appeal of his conviction that the evidence was insufficient, that the lawyers consented, and that it would subvert attorney-client confidentiality to apply the statute to attorney-client conversations. The court found the evidence was ample and that defendant's account of events was unbelievable. It refused to add an attorney-client exception to the plain words of the statute, and noted, further, that allowing such an exception would erode, not protect, attorney-client confidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The evidence was more than ample to support guilty verdict, and defendant had no basis for reading an attorney-client exception into plain statutory language. Whatever privilege might have existed was lost when the tape was handed over in discovery in a related civil action.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgments, noting that the incident on the night in question did not stand alone. The evidence of defendant's conduct overwhelmingly and separately supported his conviction on the stalking indictment. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that defendant's breaking and entry into the victim's house was done with the intent to commit a further act of stalking. Thus, the trial judge properly and thoroughly instructed the jury on this point. The trial judge gave an appropriate instruction on the element of intent to commit the felony of stalking, and the Commonwealth's burden of proof was not lessened by the instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed judgments from the Springfield Division of District Court Department (Massachusetts) that convicted them of various forms of assault and battery on police officers, based on a violent incident that took place at defendants' home during the arrest of their relative for destruction of property. Defendants claimed the warrantless arrest of their relative was unlawful and that they could not be found guilty of assault and battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions for various charges of assault and battery on police officers were affirmed. The charges resulted from an altercation that occurred at defendants' home when police attempted to arrest defendants' relative for destruction of property. Defendants claimed the warrantless arrest of their relative was unlawful, and that therefore they could not be found guilty of assault and battery for helping him resist arrest. The appellate court held that there was no legal right in Massachusetts to resist arrest, even an unlawful arrest, where no excessive force was used by the police. The appellate court found that the arrest of defendants' relative was lawful where the police officers saw him engaged in a felony. The court held that no excessive force was used under the circumstances. During the incident, the officers were engaged in their duties as public officials as contemplated by Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 13D. In addition, the appellate court held that defendants lacked standing to claim that their relative's arrest was unconstitutional where his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV were personal. According to the appellate court, the jury instructions were adequate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments convicting defendants of various charges of assault and battery on police officers, which arose from a confrontation that occurred at defendants' home when police attempted to arrest defendants' relative for a property offense, were affirmed. Defendants had no right to resist their relative's arrest, even if unlawful, where the police did not use excessive force, and the arrest was lawful where the officers witnessed a felony.</SPAN></P>

Further, prior recorded testimony of a witness was admissible if it was reliable and if the witness was currently unavailable to testify. Defendant's prior sworn and transcribed testimony was reliable and defendant was unavailable because he chose to exercise his U.S. Const. amend. V right against self-incrimination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and state law, defendants appealed orders of the Superior Court Department, Suffolk (Massachusetts), which granted partial final judgment for each plaintiff under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(b) upon declaring that county defendants' actions in forfeiting plaintiffs' good time credits were unlawful, unconstitutional, and not protected by qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmates were disciplined for possessing drugs or alcohol while serving their jail sentences. Although the disciplinary officer did not recommend that plaintiffs lose good time credits, without giving notice to plaintiffs, defendant superintendent asked defendant county commissioners to revoke portions of plaintiffs' good time credits. Defendant commissioners obliged. Plaintiffs then filed civil lawsuits, alleging defendants had violated their constitutional and statutory rights. On cross motions for summary judgment, the trial court ruled for plaintiffs. Defendants appealed. The court reversed in part. Defendants' actions violated state law because the recommendation of loss of good time credits was not a decision to be made sua sponte by defendant superintendent subsequent to the decision of the hearing officer. Defendants' actions, however, did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Plaintiffs received notice and a full opportunity to be heard before their violations were determined. No further process was required to impose a punishment described in the notice. Also, declaratory judgment was a proper vehicle for vindicating plaintiffs' rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment addressing &sect; 1983 clams reversed. Judgment that defendants violated state law affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant telecommunications corporation appealed a summary judgment from the Norfolk Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) which ordered defendant to remove a telecommunications tower on privately owned property in a rural residential district in the town of Franklin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant telecommunications corporation appealed an order to remove its tower from a residential neighborhood. The court held the motion judge's decision about the applicability of the zoning by-law was an implicit finding that the tower was not a permitted use. The court held the towers excluded from the height limitations were those on top of buildings, not defendant's free-standing 120 foot tower. Defendant failed to show that there was a material question of fact as to whether the town's order to remove the tower constituted unreasonable discrimination. The denial of a permit under these circumstances did not constitute a prohibition under the federal Telecommunications Act, 47, U.S.C.S &sect; 151 et. seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Criminal complaint against defendant was not premature. Defendant's tower did not comply with the Franklin zoning by-law. The decision of the board did not violate the Telecommunications Act of 1996, or defendant's right to equal protection. The board's interpretation of the words &quot;public utility&quot; was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 140, &sect; 62, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 90D, &sect; 20E, and Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 266, &sect; 28, alleging that the court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty on one count of failing to keep records appropriate to a certain class of second-hand dealers in motor vehicles, two counts of failing to surrender title certificate upon scrapping a motor vehicle, and two counts of receiving a stolen motor vehicle. On appeal, defendant sought reversal of his convictions on the alleged ground that the trial judge erroneously denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence. More particularly, defendant contended that an administrative inspection nominally conducted under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 66, was illegal, and this illegality infected a subsequent search under an issued search warrant. The court affirmed, holding that U.S. Const. amend. IV imposed somewhat relaxed restrictions on administrative inspections of commercial premises, because the expectation of privacy was typically weaker than in an individual's home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because the administrative search of defendant's salvage lot, conducted by plaintiff pursuant to state law, did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police conducted a warranted search of defendant's person and the vehicle he was driving followed. Defendant was charged with trafficking in cocaine, possession of heroin with intent to distribute, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and school zone violations. The superior court allowed defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized in the execution of the warrant. In its prior order, the superior court concluded that the search warrants were invalid for failure to meet the &quot;nexus&quot; requirement; i.e., for lack of probable cause to believe that the contraband sought would be found in the places to be searched. The superior court upheld the order, ruling that there was no valid search warrant, and no probable cause to search either defendant's automobile or his person. There was no reason to believe that the police would have made an arrest for crimes their confidential informants witnessed and in which they participated. The police had probable cause to believe that defendant had committed the felony of distributing cocaine at least three times in the days preceding his apprehension. That would have entitled them to arrest and charge defendant.</SPAN></P>

Code Regs. 7.15(1)(c) and (2) to prevent the release of visible or particulate asbestos emissions into the air and to provide the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection with written notice of a demolition/renovation operation involving asbestos-containing material.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both indictments were predicated upon defendant's status as the &quot;owner/operator&quot; of a demolition/renovation operation.

The court found, inter alia, that a violation of &sect; 142A, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, constituted a violation of a public welfare offense, which did not require &quot;intent.&quot; Accordingly, defendant was not entitled to dismissal of the indictments on the basis that the indictments and the bill of particulars did not identify a criminal act for which he could be found guilty. As applied to defendant, the regulations at &sect; 7.15 were not unconstitutionally vague since a person of ordinary intelligence would know that they applied to the owner of property where a project involving asbestos-containing material was taking place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a business owner who operated internet cafes, sought preliminary and permanent injunctions enjoining defendants, the Massachusetts Attorney General and county district attorneys, from enforcing Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 271, &sect; 5B, and a declaratory judgment to the effect that &sect; 5B was void as repugnant to U.S. Const. amend. I and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XVI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sponsored a &quot;free&quot; game of chance sweepstakes. Whether a participant found out his or her prize by asking store employees, accessing the information immediately on the computer, or playing a simulated video game, including casino games, the end result was unchanged. Section 5B criminalized the use of video monitors and game-simulating video displays to communicate the results of otherwise lawful sweepstakes promotions. Although &sect; 5B regulated conduct that had both &quot;speech&quot; and &quot;non-speech&quot; elements, its purpose was entirely unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and any limitation of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a Level II registered sex offender, sought review of the decision of defendant Sex Offender Registry Board which denied him an adjudicatory hearing when it considered his motion for reclassification. He also requested judicial review under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 30A, &sect; 14, to vacate the Board's denied his motion for reclassification. The offender moved for judgment on the pleadings and to vacate the Board's letter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sex offender had been convicted on one count of disseminating pornographic materials to his 13-year-old nephew. His probation was terminated. The record contained his criminal history, which reflected no subsequent convictions or criminal charges. A doctor opined that he did &quot;not present characteristics of pedophilia&quot; but exhibited fetishistic behavior that &quot;did spill over into other experiences. with a teenager.&quot; Another doctor stated that he did not meet the criteria for a sexually compulsive disorder, that the other doctor's opinion was not born out, and that he was not in need of sex offender specific treatment. The court held that the seven years the offender spent in the community was a plausible ground for granting reclassification, but not a rational explanation for denial. A stable home environment and employment situation, the lack of additional negative conduct and completion of probation were desirable and, under the regulations and supporting research, if sustained over time, were associated with a reduced risk of reoffense under. 803 Mass. Code Regs. &sect;1.40(9)(a), (12), (20). Thus, those factors could not be a rational ground for denying reclassification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion for judgment on the pleadings was allowed. The Board's letter was vacated and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases, defendants filed motions to suppress all records of their historical cellular tower site location information (CSLI) that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts seized pursuant to a warrantless search of defendants' cellular telephone records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that because the Commonwealth's applications to obtain their CSLI were not accompanied by search warrants supported by probable cause, the Commonwealth unlawfully obtained the records in violation of their rights under Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XIV. The court agreed. Because most individuals carried their cell phones on their person, CSLI enabled a cell phone to be treated as a de facto global positioning system tracking device. Defendants had a subjective expectation of privacy in the CSLI produced by their cellular telephones, and this was a privacy interest that society recognized as reasonable. Therefore, art. XIV required law enforcement officials obtain a search warrant when seeking a suspect's CSLI. Although the Commonwealth's applications for court orders for the CSLI complied with the requirements of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;2703(d), the applications were not accompanied by search warrants and were not supported by probable cause. Therefore, defendants' motions to suppress were well taken.</SPAN></P>

The court held the judge's procedure for jury empanelment did not constitute a closed courtroom in the constitutional sense as there was no evidence that the judge expressly closed the courtroom during the three-day juror empanelment process, there was nothing in the trial transcript to indicate that the judge meant the word &quot;privacy&quot; to mean that the public was excluded from the courtroom, and the court did not find that the judge's use of the word &quot;privacy&quot; meant that the public was excluded from the courtroom. Defendant failed to show he was prejudiced by the jury empanelment procedure. Neither court officers nor anyone else excluded the public, including defendant's friends and family, from the courtroom during the pendency of the trial. Mass. Gen.

The town and the administratrix, as its assignee, sued defendant insurer, alleging it breached its duty to defend and indemnify the town and violated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A and 176D. The insurer moved for summary judgment and plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the underlying lawsuit, the administratrix alleged the town's police ignored evidence of the decedent's innocence, coerced witnesses into implicating him for murder, misled a grand jury and prosecutor, and withheld evidence showing he was not at the crime scene, which led to his conviction and incarceration. He was later exonerated and his conviction was vacated. The court held that as the policy only covered damages due to negligent acts, errors, or omissions, and the acts complained of were intentional, there was no coverage. Second, the policy excluded damages arising out of the willful violation of a penal statute or ordinance. As the town's alleged actions in coercing inculpatory testimony and withholding exculpatory evidence could be deemed crimes against public justice under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268--including perjury, suborning of perjury, witness tampering, and evidence tampering--they were excluded from coverage. Third, the actions and omissions causing the damages to the decedent occurred before the inception of insurance coverage. As the insurer's denial of coverage was within the terms of the policies, it did not violate ch. 93A or 176D as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although defendant and the child's mother never married, they lived together until the child was about two years old. Defendant acknowledged paternity, paid child support, and had a sporadic relationship with the child following the parents' separation. Defendant filed for joint custody or visitation, but the family court never issued an order regarding either. Relying on Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, &sect; 10(b), the Commonwealth claimed that because the child was born out of wedlock, defendant had no custody rights and, therefore, was subject to prosecution under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 26A when he failed to return the child following a visit. However, as applied, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, &sect; 10(b), which provided that prior to or in the absence of an adjudication or voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, the mother had custody of a child born out of wedlock, was unconstitutional under Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 1, as amended by Mass. Const. amend. art. 106, because it discriminated on the basis of gender without furthering a compelling government interest. Thus, defendant had lawful authority over the child and did not violate Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 26A.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case began with an investigation into an oxycodone distribution enterprise in Massachusetts. Using information supplied by the police in Massachusetts, a Florida DEA agent applied for and obtained a federal warrant to search defendant's Florida residence. A Massachusetts detective was on the search team, which also included members of the Miami-Dade, Florida police department. At the outset, defendant was not collaterally estopped from moving to suppress the evidence by virtue of a Florida criminal proceeding involving contraband that was seized in the same search because the constitutionality of the searches and the statement was never litigated or decided in the Florida criminal case. Further, defendant had little incentive to litigate the suppression issues in Florida because he was offered probation in a plea agreement there. With regard to the validity of the search warrant, the information in the affidavit was stale and the application did not provide probable cause to believe that contraband or other evidence of illegal activity would be located in the place to be searched, at the time the search warrant issued. Defendant's statement was fruit of the illegal search.</SPAN></P>

However, defendant returned to the scene of the shooting and retrieved his brother's GPS device and cell phone. He was apprehended by police and provided information that was inconsistent with information that the police obtained from other sources. Defendant was charged and he sought dismissal. The court held a hearing and noted that the Commonwealth proceeded against defendant based solely on a theory of joint venture or aiding and abetting. It was not alleged that defendant committed any of the offenses directly. The court found no evidence to infer that prior to the shooting, defendant knew that anyone in the group, including his brother, had a gun or intended to use it. Further, there was no evidence that he shared any intent with the others to commit an assault. The court concluded that there was insufficient evidence before the grand jury to establish probable cause as to all of the indictments.

The Massachusetts statutory scheme under which defendants were charged did not prohibit all gun possession. Further, both defendants would be disqualified based on their criminal histories.

Another officer became involved in the investigation. The investigation eventually resulted in a criminal harassment charge against the injured person, which was resolved by a continuance without a finding. As the injured person's complaint clearly asserted intentional tort claims against the officers in their official capacities, as it included their professional titles after their names in both the caption and the list of parties, the claims were barred. Police officer's conduct did not arise to the requisite level of threats, intimidation, or coercion where the police officer's statement that she would return with a warrant may be a threat, generally a threat to use lawful means to reach an intended result was not actionable under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &sect; 11I. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 129D did not provide a private cause of action. Thus, that count had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In support of the wiretap warrant, a confidential informant (CI) claimed to have made drug purchases from one defendant over several years and claimed to have been present when defendant sold cocaine to others. Defendants argued that the affidavit in support of the warrant did not show that the offenses were committed in connection with organized crime, as required by &sect; 99(A). However, the court found that toll analysis of one defendant's phones suggested a connection between him and a gang. Concerted efforts of defendant and his father to sell cocaine to the CI provided reasonable suspicion that a wiretap of the target telephone would lead to evidence of a designated offense, cocaine distribution, connected to organized crime, the cocaine dealing business of defendant and his father. Additionally, the CI, a credible source of information, told police that another associate was also part of defendant's drug dealing organization. Additional information in the affidavit supported probable cause to believe that defendant, his father, and the associate were working in concert with other members of the gang in furtherance of their cocaine distribution enterprise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs hospitals sued defendant Secretary of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services (Secretary) for (1) breach of contract, (2) statutory violations, (3) quantum meruit, (4) taking without compensation, (5) declaratory judgment and mandamus, (6) review in the nature of certiorari, and (7) preemption under the supremacy clause, regarding Medicaid reimbursements. The Secretary moved for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The breach of contract and statutory violation claims failed because (1) sovereign immunity barred them, and (2) Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118G, &sect; 11(a), 2006 Mass. Acts ch. 58, &sect; 122, and 2008 Mass. Acts ch. 182, &sect; 88(b) created no contract or cause of action. The quantum meruit claim failed because the hospitals had express contracts with the Secretary. The takings claim failed because the hospitals voluntarily participated in the Medicaid program. The mandamus claim failed because the Secretary did her statutory duty to set Medicaid reimbursement rates, and mandamus did not allow their judicial review. Review in the nature of certiorari was unavailable, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 249, &sect; 4, because the rate-setting process had no indicia of judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making. A claim that the supremacy clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, preempted the Secretary's rates, since they violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396a(a)(30)(A), failed because (1) the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396 et seq., did not abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity or provide a private right of action, and (2) 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396a(a)(30)(A), on which the hospitals relied, conferred no rights on them.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 1 et seq., alleging that respondent was a sexually dangerous person. After an earlier judicial finding of probable cause, the matter was tried to the court without a jury. Respondent moved for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was age 53, had been convicted of &quot;open and gross&quot; and/or &quot;indecent exposure&quot; eight times, and reported that he had exposed himself 20 to 30 times beginning at the age of 13. The court found that it was not established that respondent suffered from anti-social personality disorder. Even if respondent suffered from a clinically diagnosed personality disorder, it did not rise to the level of a personality disorder as defined in the SDP statute. However, respondent suffered from exhibitionism. The experts were unanimous that respondent would likely commit similar exhibitionist offenses in the future if not confined. However, the past history of non-contact offending would not have escalated into contact, violent sexual offenses, or offenses involving children victims. Open and gross lewdness, was not a crime of sexual violence, and did not present dangerousness to the public in the same sense as contact/violent sexual offenses. The Commonwealth was not allowed, consistently with substantive due process under the United States Constitution, to civilly commit respondent under the SDP statute to an indeterminate period, up to and including the length of his life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent's motion for a directed verdict was allowed, judgment was entered in favor of respondent, and the petition was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner argued the plans had not exhausted their administrative remedies. The plans alleged that pursuit of their administrative remedies would be futile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner promulgated, on an emergency basis, an amendment to 211 Mass. Code Regs. 43.08, requiring, in the case of small group health coverage rate increases with effective dates on or after April 1, 2010, the plans to file their proposed rates at least 30 days before their effective dates. The filings were subject to the commissioner's disapproval if the benefits and rates did not meet the requirements of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 176G, &sect; 16. The commissioner disapproved most of the plans' proposed new rates, calling the rate increases unreasonable and excessive. Prior to filing suit, only one plan requested a hearing with the commissioner after their submitted rate had been disapproved. The fact-intensive nature of determining whether the commissioner's disapproval of the plans' submitted rates was proper did not favor application of the futility exception. Therefore, the plans had to pursue their administrative remedies. The plans failed to show that their need for a preliminary injunction, entered at the very outset of the dispute, was so strong as to outweigh the risk of further market disruption if the plans did not ultimately prevail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion for preliminary injunction was denied. As a result of that denial, the plans' motion for expedited discovery and expedited trial on the merits was also denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The procedure of a state inspector doing the required inspections took place from 2005 to 2008 without any protests or complaints from the amusement device owners. Only when the issue of the Massachusetts Department of Public Safety (DPS) charging a fee to the amusement device owners arose in 2008 did any objections arise concerning the subject inspections. The association argued that the DPS did not have the authority under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 205A to charge additional &quot;after set up at new location, but before operation&quot; inspection fees. The association claimed that since the statute only mentioned two fees, an annual licensing fee and a fee when an injury occurred on an amusement device and a state inspection was necessary, the fees for inspection &quot;after set up at a new location, but before operation&quot; were unauthorized. The court held that the DPS had the clear authority to inspect the subject amusement rides, and hence under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 7, &sect; 3B, the Massachusetts Executive Office for Administration and Finance had the authority to impose a fee to recoup a portion of the costs incurred by DPS in performing the inspections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association's motion for partial summary judgment was denied. The preliminary injunction was vacated in full. Partial summary judgment was entered for all defendants on count two of the complaint.</SPAN></P>

The board asserted that the owner engaged in misconduct which was improper, offensive, and unlawful, and violated the rules by placing objects in the hallways and that conduct constituted a nuisance interfering with rights of units owners to the quiet enjoyment of their units. The court concluded that the problems between the owner and his upstairs neighbor were not deemed a nuisance or misconduct involving violations of the rules and regulations; having told defendant to deal with the neighbor directly the board could not claim the result to be a violation of the rules and regulations. The owner did engage in inappropriate conduct at board meetings and violated the rules and regulations by leaving fans in the common areas, opening and closing fire doors, and leaving bags of dog feces at the property manager's door. Such misconduct justified the issuance of warnings as done by counsel on several occasions. The board was not entitled to injunctive relief, however, as the expressive conduct it sought to prohibit did not constitute fights words.</SPAN></P>

The justices of the trial court of Massachusetts, in their official capacity, moved to dismiss the suit under Mass. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6), alleging equal protection, due process, separation of powers, and improper taxation claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the fathers had standing. The action did not require individual member participation. The guidelines did not violate equal protection because they had a disproportionate impact on men, treated married and non-married parents differently, allowed some or all of a child support order to be designated as alimony, and did not afford never married parents the same tax advantage. The complaint did not state a due process violation merely because the guidelines were promulgated by the Chief Justice for Administration and Management (CJAM), rather than by the Massachusetts legislature. The fathers had no constitutional right to a certain type or degree of participation in the promulgation of the child support guidelines. That the guidelines were based solely on parental income rather than the actual cost of raising a child in Massachusetts did not violate due process. The CJAM's promulgation of the guidelines did not violate Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XXX. There was no merit to the fathers' claim that the CJAM's promulgation of the guidelines violated Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XXX and XXIII; child support orders entered did not constitute taxation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants argued that they were aggrieved by the withdrawals of their claims by a conciliator and the subsequent affirmation of those withdrawals by a senior judge. Defendants asserted that the subject claims should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The court concluded that dismissal was appropriate given the existence of a viable alternative remedy, namely, an action in the nature of certiorari. Nothing in Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 152 or the relevant regulations prevented the application of certiorari to the senior judge's decision. The senior judge's decision on a conciliator's withdrawal was a final judgment that was not otherwise reviewable within the agency. The court noted that Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 152, &sect; 10A(3) allowed for appeal of an administrative judge's conference order and did not apply to decisions on conciliatory withdrawals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the counts charging him with improper storage of a firearm in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 131L, on the ground that the statute unconstitutionally infringed on his right to keep and bear arms under U.S. Const. amend. II.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of extremely high levels of gas being detected in defendant's apartment, the manager obtained a civil order requiring him to give it access to his apartment in order to shut off the gas. Because of earlier difficulties with defendant and information that he had firearms in his apartment, the police accompanied the constable assigned to serve the order and related paperwork. After the police knocked and identified themselves, defendant opened the door two inches. After ordering defendant to show his hands, the police grabbed his arms, and handcuffed him. Defendant (who was in a wheelchair) had a loaded handgun in a holster at his waist. A handgun was seen in plain view in the apartment near some water bottles. A rifle or machine gun was also seen leaning against the bedroom door. Additional unsecured guns were found in the bedroom and on the floor. The court found, inter alia, that &sect; 131L addressed how a firearm should be stored, not what its condition had to  be when it is in the possession of its registered owner. Because defendant was charged in connection with the firearms lying around his apartment in an unsecured condition, &sect; 131L did not conflict with amend. II.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee filed an action against defendants, a town and a police officer, alleging a violation of his constitutional rights, false arrest, and unlawful search and seizure. The town and officer moved to dismiss the complaint under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), arguing that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &sect;&sect; 3A and 5B, provided for a limitation period of three years following the date of the accrual of the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In December 2002, the arrestee was charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and possession of marijuana. He was acquitted of operating his vehicle while under the influence in March 2004. The possession charge was dismissed in December 2006. The arrestee filed his action in October 2008. The superior court held that the arrestee's complaint was not brought within the three-year applicable limitations period. The arrestee knew that he had been harmed at the time of his arrest in December of 2002, and he protested the invalidity of an inventory search thereafter. The dismissal of charges in 2007 did not inform the arrestee at that time of the harm that had been committed. Instead, the dismissal confirmed the position that the arrestee had taken since his arrest in 2002 that the charges against him were in error and that the controlled substances seized were the fruit of an unconstitutional search of his vehicle. The arrestee's claims were not preceded by the delivery of a written presentment to the town within two years of the accrual of the cause of action pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer brought an action against the State and the commissioner, challenging the constitutionality of 2005 Mass. Acts 163, &sect; 57B. The State and the commissioner moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer alleged, among other things, that, pursuant to 2005 Mass. Acts 163, &sect; 57B, he was entitled to a rebate for capital gains taxes paid. The taxpayer also alleged that he was deprived of the use those funds before the rebate was payable, and was thus not fully paid the debt due him for the unconstitutional collection of taxes. However, the court found that the taxpayer did not allege, and his affidavit did not indicate, that he, or any of the other taxpayers he proposed to represent, had exhausted the administrative remedies provided by the statute. The Massachusetts Appellate Tax Board could have awarded interest, and the administrative remedy was adequate. The issues presented by this action were important to the taxpayer and others affected by the statute, and they may have been novel, but there was no reason to believe that they were recurrent. The factors weighed generally against the exercise of discretion to excuse exhaustion of administrative remedies in this case. Stronger than these factors was the express legislative determination that the administrative process provided by the general laws be the exclusive basis for any claim under the statute.</SPAN></P>
