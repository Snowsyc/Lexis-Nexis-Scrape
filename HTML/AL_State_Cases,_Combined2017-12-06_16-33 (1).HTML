The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father challenged the judgment entered, claiming that the trial judge erred in several different respects involving venue and the merits of his wrongful-death action. The instant court found no error. First, the father failed to establish that his consent to the transfer of the action was based on a false allegation. Second, merely stating that the guest statute violated the Equal Protection Clause, without citing or discussing relevant case law, was insufficient to agree with the father's constitutional argument. Third, because the facts presented no jury question with regard to the applicability of the guest statute to the father's son, apart from the issue of his capacity to consent to being a passenger and because he was of an ordinary intelligence and perception for his age, the guest statute was applicable to him as a matter of law. Finally, the court could not conclude that the maternal grandmother exceeded the speed limit before she lost control of her vehicle. Clearly, based on the evidence presented, she failed to appreciate the hazard created on the curving downhill road by the slickness of the road surface resulting from the recent light rain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion pursuant to an amendment to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9 that directed the reconsideration of his sentence. Once defendant filed his motion, the trial court had the authority to proceed with consideration of the motion. Further, the trial court had jurisdiction to consider defendant's motion to reconsider his sentence. The State also argued that the statute was vague because it did not define the factors that should have been taken into account in determining who was eligible for resentencing under the statute. Finally, the State argued that the statute was vague because it did not make clear which entity should decide whether an inmate was a nonviolent convicted offender within the meaning of &sect; 13A-5-9.1. Although &sect; 13A-5-9.1 was not a model of clarity, it did provide reasonably clear standards for its execution and administration; therefore, the trial court erred in declaring it unconstitutional. Finally, no basis existed for delay of the retroactive application of the amendment to &sect; 13A-5-9 to allow trial courts to modify the sentences of those inmates formerly sentenced under the Habitual Felony Offenders Act, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9, before its amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged grandson appealed a judgment of the Tuscaloosa Circuit Court (Alabama), which entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiff daughters in their suit against him to quiet title to land owned by their father when he died intestate. The grandson had counterclaimed for an adjudication of paternity in accordance with Ala. Code &sect; 43-8-48(2)b., and for an award of a share of the intestate's estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intestate died in 1966. His daughters had a brother, but he died in 1949. The grandson was born out of wedlock in 1949 and in 2002 the daughters sued him to quiet title to land the intestate owned when he died. The grandson counterclaimed for an adjudication of paternity, claiming to be the son of the intestate's son and seeking a share of the intestate's estate. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the daughters, finding that under Ala. Code 6-2-33(2), the right to share in the intestate's estate was time-barred as a matter of law 10 years after the intestate's death. On appeal, the court affirmed, agreeing that the counterclaim was time-barred. The court noted, however, that because the law afforded no means for a child born-out-of-wedlock to establish paternity until the adoption of Ala. Code &sect; 43-8-48(2) in 1982, the 10-year statute of limitations on actions for the recovery of hereditaments began running on the grandson's counterclaim upon the adoption of &sect; 43-8-48(2)b. in 1982. The court then found that because more than 10 years had passed since 1982, the grandson's counterclaim for a share of the intestate's estate was barred by Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-33(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the daughters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer challenged an order from the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, a doctor and his two physician assistants (providers), on their claims that the insurer's denial of claims they submitted for service rendered by the physician assistants violated the Physician Assistant Act (PAA), Ala. Code &sect; 27-51-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The providers brought suit against the insurer, alleging it violated Ala. Code &sect; 27-51-1 by denying claims submitted by the physician's assistants. Both parties moved for a summary judgment, which was entered in the providers' favor. The insurer appealed, challenging standing and contending that the PAA did not apply to it. The insurer argued that Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 10-4-115, 27-1-4(2), which described the procedure for making laws regulating insurance applicable to entities formed under Ala. Code tit. 10, ch. 4, art. 6 (Title 10), did not provide for application of the PAA. The providers argued that the PAA expressly held that Title 10 entities came within its terms. The court found that Ala. Code &sect; 27-51-1(f) expressly made the PAA applicable to Title 10 insurers who had a contractual relationship with the provider. Since the doctor provided care for the insurer's insureds, the requisite contractual relationship existed. The insurer's denial of the claims violated the PAA. Finally, the doctor, and therefore the assistants, had standing since the doctor was a third-party beneficiary of the insurer's contracts with its insureds.</SPAN></P>

The case was removed to federal court. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Southern Division, certified the following question to the court: Has the Alabama Dead Man's Statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-163, been superseded by Ala. R. Evid. 601?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor worked at a retail store, and the decedent was the minor's supervisor. Plaintiffs' negligence action alleged the minor was raped by the decedent. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. One of their arguments was that the Dead Man's Statute prohibited the minor from testifying about the alleged rape at trial or using her testimony about the alleged rape to defeat defendants' motion for summary judgment. The federal court certified a question to the court regarding the viability of the Dead Man's Statute. The court answered the question, holding that the Dead Man's Statute had been superseded by Ala. R. Evid. 601. The court stated that Ala. Const. amend. 328, &sect; 6.11 placed the mandatory function on the court to make the operating rules for the judicial system, subject to only specific restraints and checks, and that abrogation of the Dead Man's Statute by Ala. R. Evid. 601 represented a permissible exercise of the court's constitutional rulemaking authority. Additionally, the legislature had not subsequently changed that rule and revived the Dead Man's Statute by a general act of statewide application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State's petition for a writ of certiorari to determine whether a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals (Alabama) that defendant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-26(b) of the Community Notification Act, Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-20 et seq., conflicted with other decisions of the appellate court. The appellate court had reversed defendant's conviction under Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-26(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After various convictions, defendant was classified as an adult criminal sex offender. He was charged with violating Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-26(b) when the victim and her mother moved into defendant's house. Defendant entered a negotiated guilty plea and reserved his right to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction for violating &sect; 15-20-26(b) and held that the statute impinged on defendant's right to marry and was therefore unconstitutional. The court reversed on appeal. Defendant did not have a constitutional right merely to cohabit with his minor statutory-rape victim. Therefore, defendant had not demonstrated what, if any, legally protected right of his had been violated. At most, defendant alleged that if he attempted to marry the victim, &sect; 15-20-26(b) would have violated his constitutional right to marry. This allegation was insufficient to demonstrate that defendant had actually suffered an injury and that the injury was to a constitutionally protected right. Because defendant failed to demonstrate that his constitutional rights could be harmed, he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. IV, &sect; 65 prohibited the legislature from promulgating laws authorizing and regulating gambling devices in which chance predominated over skill in determining the outcome. The court granted the operator's writ of certiorari in order to review the statutory challenge. The court went through a thorough history of the interpretation of Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 65, noting that the American Rule was controlling in defining the term &quot;lottery,&quot; and that even if skill was present, the question was whether chance dominated for a determination as to whether a lottery existed. The court concluded that Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the jailers and supervisors at a county detention facility (jailers), appealed from the entry by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) of summary judgment for defendant sheriff in the jailers' suit against the sheriff, in his official and individual capacities, for breach of contract, quantum meruit, retaliation, and discrimination. The summary judgment had been certified as a final judgment pursuant to Ala. R. Civ. P. 54(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jailers argued that the sheriff was not immune under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The appellate court held that the jailers failed to argue before the trial court or the appellate court that the trial court improperly entered summary judgment for the sheriff in his individual capacity. State immunity immunized the sheriff in his official capacity from liability for money damages. The jailers were paid out of county funds, so the jailers failed to establish that payment of overtime compensation was a ministerial act the sheriff could be compelled to perform. Therefore, the claims against the sheriff in his official capacity for injunctive relief for breach of contract and quantum meruit grounded on the alleged nonpayment of compensation for overtime were barred. While arguably state immunity did not immunize the sheriff from an injunction compelling him to restore the jailers' work shifts to eight hours from 12 hours, the sheriff had restored the shifts to eight-hour shifts. Thus, to the extent the claims for breach of contract, retaliation, and discrimination grounded on the increase in the length of the jailers' shifts sought injunctive relief, those claims were moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal of the summary judgment for the sheriff in his official capacity on the jailers' claims for injunctive relief for breach of contract, retaliation, and discrimination grounded on the increase in shift hours was dismissed. In all other respects, the summary judgment in favor of the sheriff, in both his individual and his official capacities, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a university, its president, and 11 members of its board of trustees (the university), sought review of a declaratory judgment in favor of appellee professor rendered by the Madison Circuit Court (Alabama). The professor brought a breach of contract suit seeking back pay and injunctive relief. The complaint sought a writ of mandamus to compel the university to pay the claimed increased salary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The professor asserted that an oral contract was entered into wherein the university adopted a salary schedule that would have increased her salary in two stages in as many years. The university answered, asserting sovereign immunity and the Statute of Frauds. The court found that on its face, the oral promise of the second step of the raise was incapable of performance within one year of the making of the promise and, therefore, the professor was unable to demonstrate that the oral promise fell within an exception to the Statute of Frauds. The court also concluded by definition that the contract remained executory as to the work the professor had not yet performed and that any partial performance did not take the contact out of the influence of the Statute of Frauds. The court further held that Ala. Const. &sect; 14 (1901) barred retrospective relief based on a claim against the university alleging a breach of an employment contract, and that mandamus did not lie to compel the university to agree with the professor's version of the disputed facts, as mandamus did not lie to compel the payment of unliquidated claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to dismiss the claims seeking retroactive relief for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and to render a judgment for the university insofar as the claims for prospective relief were concerned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Delaware corporation that owned and operated hospitals in Alabama submitted an application for a tax abatement, pursuant to Alabama's Tax Incentive Reform Act of 1992, Ala.

The trial court granted the corporation, City of Birmingham, and Industrial Board's motion to dismiss the action, and the taxpayer appealed. The state supreme court held that (1) the taxpayer had standing to challenge the Board's decision so long as he could demonstrate that the decision would probably result in an increase in his tax burden; and (2) the trial court erred when it dismissed the taxpayer's action because the decision to dismiss the action precluded the taxpayer from offering evidence to show that he had standing to sue.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held the roadblock satisfied the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure prong of a constitutional seizure. The public had an interest in making sure drivers of vehicles were properly licensed and the vehicles they were driving were registered and equipped with safety devices. The roadblock was minimally intrusive to the motorists as the officers' discretion was limited by the guidelines established by the sheriff's department for conducting such stops. A superior officer was involved in planning and authorizing the stop. The intrusion upon the drivers was minimal as it involved only checking to determine whether the driver had the paperwork drivers were required to carry in their vehicles, and the stops lasted only about one minute. The presence of seven marked law-enforcement vehicles gave adequate warning to oncoming drivers that the stop was authorized and organized by law-enforcement personnel.

The Calhoun Circuit Court (Alabama), denied the motel owner's postjudgment motions pursuant to Ala. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-husband sought review of the judgment of the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals which affirmed the judgment of the Russell Circuit Court in determining that appellee ex-wife was entitled to $ 300 per month alimony after her remarriage based upon a contract entered into by the parties. The ex-husband petitioned the Alabama Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. The supreme court issued the writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties divorced and incorporated a settlement agreement into the final judgment awarding $ 1,500 per month periodic alimony to the ex-wife. The parties executed an agreement purporting to modify the amount of alimony so that the ex-wife would receive $ 300 per month after remarriage and a certain date. The ex-wife subsequently remarried. The ex-husband paid her $ 300 per the agreement. The ex-wife then petitioned the trial court to modify the final judgment to reflect the incorporation into the judgment of the agreement to modify alimony. The supreme court held that when the parties executed the agreement to reduce the periodic-alimony payments after her remarriage, the agreement was contractual in nature and could be enforced like any other contract. However, when the ex-wife petitioned the trial court to incorporate the agreement into the divorce judgment, the agreement lost its contractual nature and became subject to the equity power of the court. It then became incumbent upon the court to follow the mandates of Ala. Code &sect; 30-2-55 (1975). Thus, the trial court exceeded its authority in ordering the ex-husband to pay alimony after the ex-wife had remarried.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner hospital sought a writ of mandamus directing a judge of the Jefferson Circuit Court, Bessemer Division (Alabama), to vacate his order requiring it to produce any records pertaining to its first patient in an underlying suit against respondent, her employer. It also sought a like order against a second judge regarding the records of its second patient in the patient's personal injury suit against an alleged tortfeasor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented in both cases was whether the psychotherapist-patient privilege, codified at Ala. Code &sect; 34-26-2, barred discovery of certain mental-health records maintained by the hospital. The appeals court first held that by merely alleging mental anguish and emotional distress, the patients did not waive their psychotherapist-patient privilege. Second, the alleged tortfeasor in the second action failed to include any evidence demonstrating that the records sought were necessary to his defense. Further, the employer in the first action failed to explain how any rights they had under Ala. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6 were violated. Similarly, the employer presented no evidence establishing that its fundamental due-process right to defend itself against the first patient's various claims would be violated if it was denied access to the patient's mental-health records. Thus, mandamus relief was allowed in both cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a funeral home and its parent corporation, challenged an order from the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which denied their motion to compel arbitration in a case brought by respondent son on various claims arising from his discovery that the funeral home gave him ashes upon cremation of his mother that turned out not to be her ashes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son contracted with the funeral home to cremate his mother, but he was given the wrong ashes. In response to the son's various claims, the home and the parent brought a motion to compel arbitration. That motion was denied on a finding that, although a mandatory arbitration provision was in the contract, the contract did not evidence interstate commerce. The home and the parent appealed. The son argued that regardless of enforceability, he lacked mental capacity to contract because of his distress, the contract was unconscionable, and the parent was a non-signatory and could not enforce the provision. The court found the provision of funeral services was within Congress's commerce power, so the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq., at 9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2, mandated arbitration. The court also found that the son's assertion of the validity of the contract as the basis of his claims was inconsistent with an argument that he lacked mental capacity to contract. Also, the contract was not patently unfair to support unconscionability. However, the language of the arbitration clause limited its enforcement to signatories or third party beneficiaries, and the parent was neither.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying arbitration as to the parent corporation, but reversed the order denying the motion to compel arbitration of the son's claims against the funeral home. The court remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Acts 294. The electors argued that the trial court had lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electors, advised by an attorney who proposed himself as an alternative executive of the municipal waterworks, filed a petition to place an ordinance before the city council that would have called for waterworks bonds to be paid off, for the board to be dissolved, and for a new form of governance to be put in place. The high court held, first, that the trial court that declared the ordinance had subject matter jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action, despite the filing of the ordinance with a probate court, because Ala. Const. amend. 328, &sect; 6.04 gave the trial court general jurisdiction. City council members were not necessary parties because the proposed ordinance never quite reached them. The board clearly had standing to seek relief, as it faced dissolution if the ordinance were passed. On the merits, the court held that the proposed ordinance would have exceeded the municipality's powers under Ala. Code &sect; 11-50-32 to form municipal waterworks corporations because, under the statutory scheme, the board had to remain in control of a waterworks project until the bonds were paid off.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a patient and his wife, sued defendant hospital under the Alabama Medical Liability Act (Act), Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-480 et seq., and for loss of consortium seeking both compensatory and punitive damages. Following a jury trial, the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) entered a judgment in favor of the patient awarding him $ 2,250,000 in punitive damages, but awarded nothing in compensatory damages. The hospital appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was given an overdose in the hospital. The state's highest court held that the hospital invited any error by the trial court in entering a judgment upon the jury verdict; before the jury was dismissed, the hospital told the trial court that the verdict was proper. Further, the patient produced evidence that the hospital wantonly administered the drug, resulting in an overdose. Both nurses knew the drug was a potentially deadly, but acted recklessly in disregard of the dangers. However, the trial court's finding as to $ 1,600,000 in past and future medical expenses could not be permitted to function as the amount of compensatory damages that could have been awarded for purposes of an award of punitive damages. A special interrogatory was ordered giving the jury the opportunity to state the amount of compensatory damages it would have awarded, but did not so award, because of the evidence of the availability of compensation to the patient from the collateral source. The cap set forth in Ala. Code &sect; 6-11-21(d) could be applied by determining the compensatory damages of the party claiming punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed on the condition that the patient file with the instant court, within 14 days of the date of the opinion, a remittitur of the punitive-damages award to $ 1,500,000. Otherwise, the trial court's judgment was to be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent minors sued employees of petitioners, the Alabama Department of Youth Services (DYS) and its executive director, alleging the employees sexually assaulted and harassed them, the DYS violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1681 et seq., and the director violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Petitioners sought a writ of mandamus directing the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) to dismiss claims against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minors alleged the DYS violated Title IX by failing to respond to the sexually hostile education environment and sexual abuse and harassment at its facility, and that the director violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 by failing to protect them from the assaults and harassment. The supreme court held that because Congress abrogated the Eleventh Amendment immunity of states from suits for violations of Title IX, the DYS was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from the minors' Title IX claim. As the minors alleged the director violated their constitutional right to &quot;bodily integrity&quot; under the Fourteenth Amendment and failed to protect them from further harm after he learned of the sexual harassment and abuse, he was not entitled to a dismissal of the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim on the ground of federal qualified immunity. The DYS was not entitled to dismissal of the Title IX claim based on Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 sovereign immunity. The director was entitled to sovereign immunity from the state-law claims against him in his official capacity; but state-agent immunity did not apply to where the agent was sued in his personal capacity for willful, malicious, or fraudulent conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee winery sought a declaration that Ala. Code &sect; 28-7-16 violated the Commerce Clause, because it discriminated against wine made outside Alabama. Appellant Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration that the Native Farm Winery Act, Ala. Code &sect; 28-6-1 et seq., violated the Commerce Clause. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) ruled in favor of the winery; the Board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the Board lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Native Farm Winery Act under the Commerce Clause. The supreme court disagreed. The Board had standing to do so because the winery questioned Alabama's entire excise-tax scheme for table wine, and therefore affected the State's interest in regulating the sale of alcohol in Alabama. Ala. Code &sect; 28-7-16 levied a nondiscriminatory excise tax on all table wine, and such a nondiscriminatory measure would be upheld, in spite of any adverse effects on interstate commerce, in part because the existence of major in-state interests adversely affected was a powerful safeguard against legislative abuse. However, the nondiscriminatory tax imposed by Ala. Code &sect; 28-7-16, when coupled with the discriminatory exemption imposed by Ala. Code &sect; 28-6-4(b), violated the Commerce Clause. The Board had an interest in preserving the integrity of the State's regulatory scheme for alcoholic beverages, and on remand the trial court had to defer to the Board's selection of a remedy so long as the Board's proposed remedy cured the Commerce Clause violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment that the Board lacked standing challenge the Native Farm Winery Act, and that the challenged section of Table Wine Act was unconstitutional. It held that Alabama's taxing scheme for table wine embodied in the two Acts violated the Commerce Clause. On remand, the trial court could cure the constitutional defect in the tax scheme by striking only the tax-exemption provision in the Native Farm Winery Act.</SPAN></P>

The court previously denied the deputy's petition for a writ of mandamus directing dismissal, but granted a similar petition for the department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputy and the victim were in an automobile accident, allegedly caused by the deputy. The victim filed suit and defendants' motion to dismiss based on state immunity was denied. The court ordered the trial court to dismiss the complaint as to the department but left intact the claim against the deputy. The deputy moved for summary judgment and when his motion was denied, sought a writ of mandamus. The court held that the deputy was entitled to summary judgment. The deputy stated that he was &quot;on duty&quot; at the time of the accident and that he was delivering evidence to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences. Such an activity fell within the official duties of a deputy sheriff. Moreover, the evidence that the deputy was acting within the line and scope of his duties was undisputed. In order to defeat the deputy's motion, the victim had to present substantial evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact, which she failed to do. As such, the deputy was entitled to sovereign immunity as provided in Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 and the victim's claims for damages were barred. The deputy showed that he had a clear legal right to the order sought and mandamus was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the financial collapse of a telecommunications corporation, the state retirement systems claimed that the president and the chief financial officer of that corporation, along with the banks that were involved with that corporation, engaged in various accounting machinations and irregularities. The chief financial officer was indicted in a criminal proceeding. The president was not indicted, but he was the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation. The president asserted that his right against self-incrimination would be violated if discovery was conducted in the civil case. The banks alleged that the balance of interests weighed against discovery as to them. On appeal, the court found that the president ran a clear risk of self-incrimination in the overlapping criminal proceeding if he submitted to the broad discovery permissible in a civil case, and none of the balance of interest factors warranted allowing discovery to go forward as to him. However, the trial court properly did not grant a stay to the banks as there was not good cause shown by them for the relief that they sought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Bibb County Circuit Court (Alabama) granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, the county, the county commission, and a probate judge, in appellant developer's class action suit challenging the constitutionality of a special transaction fee imposed against it upon conducting business with the probate court. The developer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer challenged the judgment entered, claiming that it was unconstitutional for the county probate court to raise fees. It was undisputed that the act complained of, 1993 Ala. Acts 521, was a local law applicable to or operative in the county and that the act became effective without a referendum election and without approval by a majority of the qualified county electors. Nevertheless, based on the arguments presented, neither the act nor the fee was unconstitutional. The fee was not paid to the probate judge as compensation or otherwise for his use. It was to be used to upgrade and modernize the probate office. Further, Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 104(24) had nothing to do with the case, and as such Ala. Const. amend. 332 was not implicated. Consequently, it was immaterial that the fee was implemented without a referendum election. Therefore, in the context presented in the instant appeal, the fee was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband, as administrator of his wife's estate, sued defendant tobacco companies. The allegations included breach of warranty and liability under the Alabama Extended Manufacturer's Liability Doctrine (AEMLD). Following removal to federal court, the claims were dismissed. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit certified various questions, including the viability of certain claims and limitations periods.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent smoked cigarettes for most of her life. The complaint alleged that she started smoking when she was about 15. It also alleged that she became addicted early on, although at that time she was unaware of her addiction. The smoking was the proximate cause of her lung cancer, from which she died. In answering the questions, which had been certified, pursuant to Ala. R. App. P. 18, the court found that the claims for negligence and wantonness, at the complaint stage of the proceedings, were viable alternatives to the AEMLD claim. The language of the Uniform Commercial Code made no reference to tort law. It concerned itself with the quality of the product by establishing standards of merchantability for a particular purpose, while the tort law concerned itself with safety standards by imposing strict liability upon one who sold an unreasonably dangerous product which caused physical harm. The court also found that addiction to nicotine was a compensable injury, at a minimum, in terms of the costs of supporting an addiction. The statute of limitations, as to the decedent's tort claims, began to run when she recognized her addiction, even if the total damages were unknown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A claim alleging breach of an implied warranty of merchantability was separate and distinct from an AEMLD claim. As to the tort claims, the statutory limitation period began to run at the moment a smoker recognized that he or she had become addicted. The statute of limitations for a claim for breach of implied warranty was four years after the cause of action had accrued. The court respectfully declined to answer the remaining questions.</SPAN></P>

The police officer was entitled to a JML as to the invasion-of-privacy and slander claims against him. The city council member was entitled to a JML as to the citizen's invasion-of-privacy and slander claims against her based on absolute and qualified privilege. There were no remaining claims against the individuals. Therefore, the judgment against them was reversed.

Code &sect; 13A-14-2. The university and the board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university and the board challenged the judgments entered. The appeals court first held that the newspapers timely filed their action within two years of the first alleged violations. Second, the board could only legally act to set policy regarding the university with the presence of a quorum. Further, any meeting of a quorum of either of two exceptional standing committees was subject to the Sunshine Law. Third, when the board met in executive session to discuss awarding an honorary degree or a building name, such was within the character and good name exception. Finally, the attorney-client privilege exception to the Sunshine Law included a meeting between a board, body, or commission and its attorney to discuss the legal ramifications of, and legal options for, not only pending litigation but also controversies not yet litigated but imminently likely to be litigated, or imminently likely to be litigated if the board pursued a proposed course provided.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) certified appellee individuals' claims for plaintiff class treatment and certified appellants, arcade owners and operators and video-gaming machine lessors, as two defendant classes in the lawsuit. The trial court also issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining all members of the defendant classes from operating any video-gaming machines within the State of Alabama. The defendant classes appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals sought to recover damages from the owners and operators of arcade video-gaming machines and the lessors of the machines. The individuals sought to certify as a class all persons who played the video gaming machines over a period of time. They also sought to certify the arcade defendant class and the leasing defendant class as separate classes of similarly situated defendants. The supreme court found that the individuals' claims for money damages predominated over their claims for injunctive relief and that those claims did not flow out of a group injury, but depended upon a showing of individual damages rather than upon a showing of damages suffered by the class as a whole. Thus, individual issues predominated over the questions of law or fact common to the class members. Therefore, the trial court improperly certified the plaintiff class pursuant to Ala. R. Civ. P. 23. Further, the trial court improperly applied the juridical-link exception to find typicality among the claims and defenses of the defendant class members, so that the defendant classes could not be certified. Finally, the trial court exceeded its discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's certification of the plaintiff class and its certification of the defendant classes was reversed, the preliminary injunction issued by the trial court was dissolved, and the action was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellants, the Montgomery County District Attorney, taxpayers, and Elmore County, sought review of the judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) confirming the validity and legality of $ 100 million in revenue warrants issued by appellee Board of Education of Montgomery County and an ordinance enacted by appellee Montgomery County Commission imposing an occupational tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board passed a resolution authorizing the sale and issuance of warrants. The Commission enacted the Privilege License Tax Upon the Privilege of Engaging in Trades, Occupations, and Professions in Montgomery County Ordinance, imposing a one and a half percent tax on employee compensation and owner compensation received by individuals who worked in the county. The proceeds of the occupational tax were pledged to the board for public school purposes, including interest on the warrants. The taxpayers and district attorney asserted that the county was not authorized by Ala. Code &sect; 40-12-4 (1975) to levy the tax. The Alabama Supreme Court agreed that the occupational tax was invalid. Ala. Code &sect; 40-12-4(b) (1975) prohibited the occupational tax, because &sect; 40-12-4(b) prohibited taxes on gross receipts imposed on either an employee or an employer. The occupational tax was also prohibited under &sect; 40-12-4(b), because it was not levied uniformly, as it did not tax certain persons engaged in the pursuit of business within the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded. The appeal filed by Elmore County was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff consumer sued defendant Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, alleging it violated the Commerce Clause by imposing an excise tax on imported wine and violated the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Ala. Code &sect; 41-22-1 et seq., when it adopted wine-pricing rules. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) granted summary judgment to the Board. The consumer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the consumer lacked standing to challenge the excise tax under the Commerce Clause, as the tax was imposed on wholesalers, not consumers, and the Board had not violated the APA when it failed to establish and publish notice of its markup procedure for table wine. The appellate court disagreed with both rulings. The consumer had standing to challenge the tax, as Ala. Code &sect; 28-7-16 required consumers of table wine, not wholesalers or retailers, to pay the tax. And, as the Board presented no evidence that it published its procedure for marking up the price of table wine in the Alabama Administrative Monthly (as required by Ala. Code &sect; 41-22-5(a)(1)), or that interested persons were allowed to submit comments or proposals regarding the markup procedures for table wine (as required by &sect; 41-22-5(a)(2)), granting summary judgment in favor of the Board on the consumer's claim that the Board violated the APA was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order entering a summary judgment in favor of the Board based on the consumer's lack of standing and its finding that the APA had not been violated was reversed, and the cause was remanded with instructions to the trial court to order the Board to comply with the APA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sued defendants, the Alabama Governor and Attorney General and the Executive Director of the Alabama Historical Commission, alleging that proposed changes in landscaping near the state capitol violated Ala. Code &sect; 41-9-261. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) dismissed the Attorney General as a party and granted summary judgment to the remaining defendants on grounds that the taxpayer lacked standing. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission voted to extend and alter the Alabama Capitol grounds, citing &sect; 41-9-261 as its authority for this action. The Governor approved the changes. The taxpayer alleged that this was an unlawful expenditure of public funds and asked that the trial court to enjoin the Governor and Commission from proceeding with the project. He filed an amended complaint in his individual capacity as a U.S. and Alabama taxpayer. The trial court found that under Alabama law, a federal taxpayer could not challenge the legality, under state law, of the expenditure of federal funds. The supreme court agreed with the trial court's finding that defendants proved through their affidavits and exhibits that all spending on the project would ultimately come from federal funds. Defendants' affidavits on this issue were clear and unequivocal, were based on the personal knowledge of the affiants, and the taxpayer did not controvert them. As the right of taxpayers to sue over expenditures of state funds was based upon their liability to replenish the public treasury, the taxpayer had no standing to sue where the state funds were later reimbursed with federal funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff argued that as the sheriff of the county he was immune from suit pursuant to Ala. Const. art.

On appeal, the court noted that the deputies sought to recover from the sheriff back pay; costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney fees; and appropriate monetary damages, both compensatory and punitive. The court found that to the extent that the deputies sought monetary damages against the sheriff, individually, the sheriff's petition for the writ of mandamus directing the trial court to dismiss the claims against him in his individual capacity should be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 26-10A-7, the juvenile court found that appellant father gave implied consent to the adoption of his minor son, terminated his parental rights to his child, denied the joint petition of the father and appellant paternal grandmother for custody of the child, and approved the adoption of the child by appellee adoptive parents. The Court of Civil Appeals (Alabama) affirmed the judgment. Appellants sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The biological parents were 17 when the child was born. The mother consented to the adoption, and the adoptive parents took the child home from the hospital. The father requested a blood test to determine paternity and a stay of the adoption action. The juvenile court held that the father's failure to support or seek visitation with the child was grounds to terminate his parental rights. The supreme court disagreed. Once the adoptive parents petitioned to adopt the child, they assumed responsibility for his support, and, thus, relieved the father of such duty. Further, they would not allow him to have contact with the child. The father's conduct after the child's birth negated any finding of an intent to abandon the child or to give implied consent to the adoption. As to the &quot;prebirth-abandonment&quot; provision of Ala. Code &sect; 26-10A-9, this statute became effective 25 days before the child's birth, but was to have retroactive effect to January 1, 1997. By filing with the putative-father registry, the father had a defense to the adoption action; thus, Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 95 banned the legislature from taking away his rights by requiring the retroactive application of &sect; 26-10A-9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of civil appeals was reversed, judgment was rendered for the father that his parental rights as the father of the child were not terminated, and the case was remanded to the juvenile court for proceedings to determine the proper custody of the child.</SPAN></P>

The Montgomery Circuit Court, Alabama, entered summary judgment in favor of the city and awarded the city attorney fees. The board's motion to vacate the trial court's order was denied. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city alleged that it was deprived of earmarked funds, in violation of the formula provided in Ala. Code &sect; 28-3-74. The trial court denied the city monetary relief based on the board's state immunity. The board argued that the trial court should have declared 2001 Ala. Acts valid and confirmed the prior distributions and that the trial court erred in awarding the city attorney fees. The city argued that the state immunity did not bar monetary relief. The supreme court held that it was clear that the legislature had the power under 2001 Ala. Acts to retroactively cure and validate its prior appropriations without violating a vested right, as the funds were never paid to the city and the State never owed a debt to the city. The city failed to prove that it had a vested right in the funds and that the transfers did not violate Ala. Const. &sect; 213, as the State was never obligated to pay an amount to the city. Additionally, the promise to distribute a percentage of net profits was not enforceable as a debt, as the funds were not constitutionally required to be paid to the city. However, the attorney fees were improperly awarded under the common-fund theory, as no fund was created.</SPAN></P>

The firm made such a filing in Alabama. The supreme court held the firm's retention after the harm alleged in the investors' complaint was irrelevant to jurisdiction. As to harm alleged in the complaint, an attorney-client relationship did not, alone, create jurisdiction. The firm represented limited-liability companies, of which an Alabama resident was a fractional owner, rather than representing an actual Alabama resident. The firm's compensation did not create personal jurisdiction. Its out-of-state activities for an Alabama client, however substantial, were irrelevant to a minimum contacts analysis of jurisdiction. The firm's only relevant contact with Alabama was an allegedly improper blue-sky filing, as, at times material to the case, the firm did not represent, or deal directly with, an Alabama resident. Services for the companies were done out of state, so grounds for general jurisdiction were absent, and the blue-sky filing did not satisfy the effects test as the firm did not precipitate it, and it was not directed at identifiable Alabama residents.</SPAN></P>

The appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the judgment entered, contending that: (1) the city abused its power and attempted to manipulate the different branches of government, regardless of the rights of the residents of Alabama; and, (2) both the city and the legislature set out to design legislation to specifically decide the first dispute between the parties while it was pending, and thus violated the constitutional rights of the people they were charged to protect. The appeals court held that the trial court's judgment in the first dispute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The validity of 1999 Ala. Acts 99-547 (the 1999 Act) was not addressed in the first dispute, and if it was enacted so as to have prospective operation, it could not usurp the power of the court to resolve the pending litigation in that dispute. The 1999 Act was not enacted to retrospectively resolve the litigation in the first dispute. It did not take away appellants' cause of action, nor did it destroy a defense available to them in the first dispute. In sum, the testimony presented by appellants failed to establish a genuine issue as to a material fact regarding a violation of Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 105.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant electrical cooperative appealed from an order by the Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama) awarding attorneys' fees to appellee trustees. Appellant members appealed from the merits of the judgment entered in the trustees' shareholder derivative action against the cooperative. The cooperative appealed from the trial court's stay of its judgment in the trustees' action, entered to permit the members to appeal. The appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cooperative contended that the trustees were not entitled to attorneys' fees. The appellate court agreed. The trustees were not entitled to attorneys' fees under the common benefit rule, the shareholder derivative action common benefit doctrine, or Ala. Code &sect; 37-6- 3(16)a. The trustees did not succeed in their action contesting the constitutionality of the vote-by-mail procedure, and could not obtain attorneys' fees for precipitating a declaration of the validity of the resolution. Section 37-6-3(16)a. did not authorize the indemnification of shareholders. The trustees did not contend that they were entitled to attorneys' fees in the mailing list action, or in the members' action contending there was inadequate notice of a special meeting. The indemnification of one trustee was discretionary, as he was unsuccessful on appeal. The members' appeal of the judgment validating the vote-by-mail statute was dismissed. The members were not parties and lacked standing to appeal the judgment on the vote-by-mail resolution. The stay of the judgment in the trustees' action contesting the vote-by-mail was reversed. It was entered to accommodate the members' appeal.</SPAN></P>

The stay of the judgment validating the vote-by-mail resolution was reversed, and the cause was remanded to the trial court to vacate the stay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The instant court rejected defendant's contention that a hearing was required to determine if he was mentally retarded and therefore not subject to the death penalty. A licensed clinical neuropsychologist and clinical psychologist testified that defendant's IQ scores indicated a borderline range of psychometric intelligence and that his intellectual functioning had probably declined as he had aged because of his abuse of alcohol. However, defendant did have a borderline personality disorder and an alcohol dependence. Moreover, he earned a GED certificate and completed community college courses while in prison. Additionally, he did not exhibit significant or substantial deficits in adaptive behavior before or after age 18. Finally, the instant court refrained from making policy decisions with regard to claims of mental retardation by capital defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of three counts of capital murder. After remand to the trial court, the Court of Criminal Appeals (Alabama) affirmed the trial court's judgment overriding the jury's life sentence and sentencing petitioner to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner stabbed his grandparents to death and took his grandfather's wallet. Petitioner was charged with two counts of murder made capital because the murder was committed during a robbery and one count of murder made capital because two or more persons were murdered pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct. Because the jury convicted petitioner of two counts of murder during a robbery in the first degree, the statutory aggravating circumstance of committing a capital offense while engaged in the commission of a robbery was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the jury, and not the trial judge, determined the existence of the aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty. Also, the jury was not required to weigh the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances. Additionally, the supreme court found that the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, and, while it was true that petitioner had no significant prior criminal history and that he was 19 at the time of the murders, those circumstances paled in comparison to the aggravating circumstances. Thus, the trial court did not err in sentencing petitioner to death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chambers Circuit Court, Alabama, issued a writ of mandamus requiring appellant county commission to call a special election as demanded by the appellee county board of education to allow voters to consider a special school-district tax. The commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission raised three issues on appeal: (1) could the city and county boards of education dictate the rate, term, and conditions of an ad valorem tax levy for educational purposes? (2) Could the boards demand a special tax election in regard to a county-wide ad valorem tax? (3) Did the boards sustain the burden of proof necessary for the issuance of a writ of mandamus? The commission further argued that the boards were purely administrative bodies, thus they had no power to tax unless that power was expressly given to them by the state constitution. The appeals court agreed. First, the only provision in the amendment addressing the power to tax was the first sentence, but that only applied to the county governing body, not to any school board. The last sentence of the amendment only provided for an election procedure, not an extension of the five-mill taxing power. Second, the last sentence of the amendment was a general provision, which could not countermand the provisions of the first sentence. Third, the reference to Ala. Const. amend. 3 in the last sentence of Ala. Const. amend. 202 could hardly serve as a vehicle to grant the boards five-mill taxing power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole question was whether the trial court erred in refusing to compel arbitration on the basis that the underlying transaction did not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The appellate court held that the trial court properly denied the request to arbitrate. The transaction occurred in Alabama between two Alabama residents. The purchaser paid cash for the car. Further, the car dealer, an Alabama corporation, purchased the car from an entity bearing an Alabama address at an auto auction in Alabama. The vehicle was delivered to the buyer in Alabama. All of the rights, duties and obligations of the parties to that other transaction arose in Alabama. The intrastate transaction did not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, making the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq., inapplicable. The trial court did not err in refusing to compel arbitration under Ala. Code &sect; 8-1-41(3).</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced, as an habitual felony offender with one prior felony conviction, to the maximum of life imprisonment, plus an additional 10 years' imprisonment pursuant to the schoolyard and public housing project enhancement statutes. Defendant's postjudgment motion for a reduction of his sentence was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant objected to the offer of marijuana and a certificate of analysis, offered by the State pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-300 et seq., on the sole ground that the State had failed to prove the requisite chain of custody. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in admitting the certificate and the plant material with it. Testimony identified all links in the chain of custody and proved the safeguarding and handling of the evidence by each link in the chain until the evidence bag was relinquished to the testing facility, where the plant material was analyzed and determined to be marijuana.  Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-300 preempted the traditional chain of custody predicate law for the evidence once it was received by the testing facility. Although the certificate of analysis did not technically conform to the &sect; 12-21-300 signing and swearing requirement, because defendant did not challenge the defect and did not challenge Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-300 et seq. itself, defendant effectively conceded the validity of the statute itself and the sufficiency of the certificate as compliance with Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-300.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Shelby Circuit Court (Alabama) entered plaintiff customers' requested class-certification order certifying two different classes in their suit against defendant corporation after the corporation allegedly charged them and others an amount in excess of the statutory &quot;reasonable costs&quot; of reproducing certain records. The corporation appealed the class-certification order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customers had similar claims against the corporation for overcharges the corporation allegedly made in copying certain records for the customers. One customer requested, through her counsel, copies of her medical records and an itemized statement from her medical provider. The corporation sent invoices reflecting the postage and handling charges to her attorney, who paid the invoices without objection. The other customer requested, through counsel, only a copy of her billing record. The corporation sent the billing record along with its invoice to that customer's attorney. The attorney paid the invoice with no objection. Both customers concluded they, and others similarly situated, may have overpaid based on the &quot;reasonable costs&quot; permitted under Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-6.1. The customers moved for a class-certification order certifying two classes and claiming that the invoices had been paid under mistakes of fact. After the trial court granted their request, the state supreme court found that proof essential to the underlying claims defeated the predominance and superiority requirements of Ala. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), and, thus, made class certification improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose out of an automobile accident in which plaintiff, a minor, was injured when defendant deputy sheriff collided with the vehicle in which the minor was a passenger while the deputy was responding to an emergency dispatch and driving at a high rate of speed. The Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama) entered a summary judgment for the deputy. The minor appealed. The deputy moved for sanctions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was previously removed to federal court, where the deputy filed a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which was granted. In the state court, the deputy filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing res judicata and/or collateral estoppel, or, in the alternative, State-agent immunity, barred the action. The trial court granted that motion and entered a summary judgment for the deputy, but it did not specify on what ground. On appeal, the minor argued that the federal district court's dismissal of his complaint did not meet the elements of res judicata. The appellate court found that because the federal court's decision was an adjudication on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction involving the same parties and the same claims, the minor's action was barred by the res judicata effect of the federal district court's dismissal of all of the minor's claims. However, because it neglected to mention the state-law claims in its dismissal, if the minor was to obtain a clarification from the federal court under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60 that the dismissal of the state-law claims was without prejudice, he would be entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed, and the motion for sanctions was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners argued that: (1) the business license tax ordinances were vague or overbroad; (2) their ownership of real property was not taxable; (3) the penalties imposed were unreasonable and excessive; and (4) some of the ordinances double taxed. The court of appeals disagreed. The phase &quot;engaged in the business of leasing,&quot; required leasing, accompanied by the intent to derive a profit from such action. Because the ordinances required a license for leasing, the terms &quot;engaged in the business of leasing&quot; and &quot;engaged in leasing&quot; were not unconstitutionally vague. Second, the owners could not show that the ordinances imposed an unnecessary and unreasonable burden upon them. Because they presented no evidence that the city's actions were unreasonable, their overbreadth argument failed. Next, because the owners intended to derive profit, benefit, or monetary gain from their leasing activities, the fact that they sought to limit their involvement did not mean that they did not engage in such activities at all. The ordinances did not impose a tax on the mere ownership of real property. Instead, they levied a tax for the privilege of engaging in the leasing of property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montgomery Circuit Court, Alabama, awarded attorney fees to plaintiff representative of a class of schoolteachers (representative), based on the common-benefit exception to the American rule governing the recovery of attorney fees. The appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the state board of education, superintendent, comptroller, teacher's retirement system, and all city and county school districts, challenged the grant of attorney's fees to the representative. The board asserted that the award was improper because: (1) no common benefit resulted; (2) if any common benefit did result, the benefit occurred upon the governor's signing into law the amendment to the Foundation Act (Act), and the fees awarded were generated after that time; (3) 30 days after the entry of the order, the trial court lost subject-matter jurisdiction; (4) sovereign immunity barred the award; and (5) the representative failed to carry his burden of proof. The court of appeals only addressed the issue of whether the suit resulted in a common benefit. It held that it did not. The lower court could only have speculated as to what prompted the legislature to amend the Act. Finally, the board would be required to pay attorney fees with funds from its annual budget, money which was allocated for the purpose of educating children enrolled in the public schools. Thus, the appeals court was hard pressed to find a common benefit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractors built a house for the owners and issued a &quot;Limited New Home Warranty&quot; that provided for arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq.

The parties were Alabama residents and the object of the transaction, the house, was incapable of moving across state lines.

The supreme court had, on various occasions, limited the extent of the trial court's rulings. The supreme court held Ala. Const. amend. 582 reflected Alabama's adherence to the principle of separation of powers in Ala. Const. art. III, &sect; 43, by effectively nullifying any state court order requiring the disbursement of public funds, until such order was approved by the legislature. Also, Ala. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 256, placed the power over the state's public education in the legislature. The failure of opinions on the same subject in other states to find that the judiciary lacked the power to order a specific remedy if the legislature failed to address a constitutional deficiency did not support judicial intrusion into legislative matters. The judiciary was required by Ala. Const. art. III, &sect; 43, to refrain from becoming involved in a subject clearly within the legislature's purview.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. IX, &sect; 200. Two senators also intervened.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters sought a judgment declaring that the new plan violated state law and injunctive relief. The trial court afforded the legislature appropriate deference in its solution to the difficult question of dividing the state into 35 senate districts with approximately equal population. The districts created by the legislature were within plus or minus five percent of the ideal population of a senate district. As judges, the appellate court could not overturn the redistricting plan on the grounds asserted by the voters. The voters failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality that precedent required to attach to the redistricting plan. The appellate court declined to exercise the power of judicial review, as no express clause of the constitution was clearly disregarded. The appellate court refused to require further proceedings on whether a deviation in population of plus or minus five percent violated the constitutional mandate of Ala. Const. art. IX, &sect; 200 that districts shall be as nearly equal to each other in the number of inhabitants as may be. The trial court properly entered a summary judgment in favor of the election officials, as joined in by the intervenors.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the supreme court found that the taxpayers' class action seeking a refund of franchise taxes paid pursuant to Alabama's invalid statutory scheme was an action against the state as that concept was expressed in Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. Article I, &sect; 14 forbid a lawsuit against the State of Alabama. Further, the taxpayers failed to comply with the jurisdictional requirements of Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress a statement because the officer tricked him into making it. While there was no question the detective lied to defendant, the lie was told in order to find out if defendant had a relationship with the other codefendants, and not to induce him to confess to a crime. Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights. Defendant further argued the trial court erred both in granting the State's motion in limine, preventing him from presenting motive evidence, and in overriding the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. First, nothing in the record supported the contention that the offense was the result of a drug deal gone bad. Therefore, the grant of the State's motion was proper. Second, the trial court specifically stated that defendant's juvenile record could not be considered. As to the alleged override of the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment, it was evident that the trial court independently weighed all the circumstances and there was no evidence indicating that bias, passion, or prejudice were factors in the imposition of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

Alternatively, it contended that if no genuine issue existed, the court erred as a matter of law in failing to strike down as unconstitutional the department's practice of collecting sales taxes from Mississippi governmental entities while exempting Alabama governmental entities. Because the department had the burden of proof to justify a law that on its face discriminated against interstate commerce, the trial court erred in entering a summary judgment where no evidentiary justification for the discriminatory impact was presented. Further, the appeals court could not render judgment in the corporation's favor, although it accepted the contention that summary judgment was precluded by the incorrect determination that no genuine issues of material fact existed relating to the justification for any discriminatory treatment in assessing sales taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An attorney and an engineer who worked in Montgomery, Alabama, filed suit against the city claiming that it was violating 1957 Ala. Acts 457 (Act 457) by imposed a business or privilege license tax on salaried professionals. Act 457 provided that no city in Alabama having a population of at least 100,000 people but no more than 125,000 people had the power to levy or impose such a tax. The parties agreed that the city had a population of more than 125,000 people at the time the lawsuit was filed but the attorney and the engineer argued that Act 457 applied to the city when it was passed and that the city was not allowed to impose the tax merely because its population had increased. The state supreme court held that an act based on a population classification must have application to a shifting class in order to be a general law and that, if a class within a population classification was to be considered as &quot;shifting,&quot; a city or county must be able to outgrow or grow into the classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">S. 539, Reg. Sess. (Ala. 2002) was a local bill relating to Cherokee County permitting certain municipalities in Cherokee County with a population of not less than 1,300 inhabitants nor more than 1,500 inhabitants to determine by a local option election whether alcoholic beverages could be legally sold and distributed within the corporate limits of the municipality. The court held that the bill was a local law regulating or prohibiting the liquor traffic under Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 104. The purpose of the bill was to authorize an election to allow the creation of a traffic in alcoholic beverages in specified municipalities in Cherokee County and did not fit within the legislature's power to enact a local law prohibiting such traffic. The framers of the Alabama Constitution did not intend that the phrase &quot;regulating or prohibiting the liquor traffic&quot; in &sect; 104 include the concept of authorizing additional liquor traffic where none previously existed. The bill did not fit within the ambit of the last paragraph of &sect; 104. The purpose of the bill was the same as evidenced in Ala. Code &sect; 28-2A-1 et seq., and, if enacted, the law would violate Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 105.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court of Alabama held that Act 427 was constitutional, for different reasons than those relied upon by the trial court. The term &quot;general laws&quot; was in Ala. Const. amend. 332 to acknowledge the legislature's standing power to enact a uniform scheme for judicial pay and court costs when it desired, notwithstanding Amendment 332. This reading was logical, and comported with the legislature's intent in enacting both 1999 Ala. Acts 427, and 1973 Ala. Acts 557, which proposed amend. 332. Thus, amend. 332 did not require a referendum vote on 1999 Ala. Acts 427, a general law, before the law could take effect throughout Alabama and in Bibb County.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured sued defendant insurer for bad faith in improperly evaluating, failing to investigate, and ultimately denying her claim for underinsured-motorist (UIM) benefits. She also alleged breach of insurance contract, but the insurer paid the contract benefits before trial. The Colbert Circuit Court (Alabama) awarded her $ 201,000 compensatory and $ 600,000 punitive damages, and denied the insurer's posttrial motions. It appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1971, the Alabama Supreme Court found void under state law a workers' compensation limit-of-liability insurance provision.  Ala. Code &sect; 32-7-23 defined &quot;uninsured&quot; to include UIM. In 1997, the insured, while working, was in a vehicle that was rear-ended. She filed for workers' compensation, had over $ 60,000 medical expenses, and was totally disabled. Her policies with the insurer contained the invalid provision and had $ 40,000 total UIM coverage. The insurer's experienced adjuster twice denied coverage but expressed openness to further discussion. After suit was filed, the senior claims analyst saw the file, realized the claim was ripe, and threatened to prolong the case unless the insured took the policy limits. The insurer filed a false affidavit. The supreme court found both &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;abnormal&quot; bad faith. The insurer had never inquired as to whether the insured had settled claims with other carriers involved. As the insured evidenced both physical and mental pain, strict scrutiny review was not applied to the compensatory damages. Five of the seven Hammond/Green Oil factors supported punitive damages. The parties were not adversaries at the time of the second denial.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 22-22A-8(a), (b). The supreme court held the procedures adopted were within the definition of &quot;rule&quot; in Ala.

The appellate court found that the insurer could not rely upon the ripple effect on interstate commerce of the payment of insurance premiums by Alabama insureds to an Alabama insurer as support for a conclusion that the employment agreement between the insurer and agent had a substantial effect upon interstate commerce. The insurer offered no evidence to show that the agent would service clients located outside Alabama. The fact that the agent purchased gasoline to operate her vehicle, without quantification of the relation of that fact to her activities under the contract, did not tip the scale toward a finding that the employment agreement had a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The fact that the insurer purchased interstate goods that it used in its business, without quantification or application to the situation, was also inadequate to support a finding that the employment agreement had a substantial effect on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The questioned statute allowed the natural grandparents of an adoptee to petition for post-adoption visitation rights in the context of intrafamily adoptions. The section clearly abrogated, under certain circumstances, the common-law rule which did not allow grandparents a legal right of visitation. The court of civil appeals focused upon the United States Supreme Court's holding in Troxel in finding the statute unconstitutionally infringed upon adoptive parents' fundamental right to parent. However, Troxel involved the rights of a natural mother, while the instant case involved the rights of adopting parents in the limited context of intrafamily adoptions. The issue was whether the legislature had the power to qualify the rights of adopting parents by enacting &sect; 26-10A-30. The supreme court held the legislature had such power, and that it was the clear intent of the legislature in enacting &sect; 26-10A-30 to give the trial court the authority to grant post-adoption visitation rights to the natural grandparents of the adoptee, when the adoptee was adopted by a family member.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee buyer sued appellant manufacturers for, inter alia, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and wanton repair. The Elmore Circuit Court (Alabama) awarded the buyer, on a jury verdict, compensatory and punitive damages and attorney fees. The manufacturers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer specially ordered the manufactured home which the manufacturers built. The buyer attempted unsuccessfully to have the manufacturers remedy the home's numerous defects. He alleged mental anguish due to the manufacturers' actions; the jury awarded him $ 150,000 in compensatory, and $ 600,000 in punitive damages. Because the manufacturers gave the buyer a written warranty, they could not exclude implied warranties under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2301-2312. By not objecting at trial, the manufacturers failed to preserve the issue of whether the trial court improperly allowed introduction of evidence of other suits against the manufacturers. The buyer's wife's testimony as to his manifestations of emotional stress was sufficient to support an award of damages for mental anguish. However, as the manufacturers challenged the punitive damages award as being unconstitutionally excessive, the instant court, in accord with Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 6-11-23(a), 6-11-24(a), previously held to be unconstitutional, but ruled binding, conducted a de novo review and reduced that award to bring it in line with awards in comparable cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to an election for mayor and city council members, the city adopted a redistricting plan for seven wards to reflect annexations and population changes. The city obtained preclearance from the United States Attorney General for its redistricting plan and annexations, but he refused to preclear all of the ward assignments. The city responded by allowing the contested subdivisions in the ward assignments to vote for mayor, but did not count their votes in the city council election. The trial court dismissed the voters' claim that they were unconstitutionally denied the right to vote. The appellate court noted the Voting Rights Act, specifically 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1973c, was aimed at state regulations which had the effect of denying citizens their right to vote because of their race. The appellate court held cases involving the interpretation of the preclearance requirements of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1973c were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. The appellate court concluded the relief sought by the voters was not merely an election contest because it implicated Voting Rights Act issues; thus the trial court did not have jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama) denied defendant corporate agents' motion to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction and granted the corporate agents' motion to strike involving evidentiary materials the plaintiff widow submitted in response to the motion to dismiss. The corporate agents petitioned for writs of mandamus to review the motion denial and the widow petitioned for the same writ to vacate the granting of the motion to strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three corporate agents formed a Delaware corporation with its principal residence in North Carolina. They were all residents of North Carolina. The widow alleged her husband used a product formulated, manufactured, labeled, and distributed by them to fix a tire. The husband inflated the tire with their product. The widow alleged, however, that the product's propellant was explosive. She further alleged the husband was welding near the tire when it exploded and killed him. The corporate agents argued the Alabama courts did not have personal jurisdiction over them. The widow tendered alleged evidence concerning that allegation. After the trial court concluded personal jurisdiction existed over the corporate agents and struck certain material the wife submitted, the state supreme court found the evidence showed the exercise of personal jurisdiction was proper as to two corporate agents who had sufficient minimal contacts purposefully directed at Alabama. Thus, the motion to strike ruling was moot as to the two corporate agents. Relief was granted to the third corporate agent and against the widow as he had no Alabama contacts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for writ of mandamus was denied as to two corporate agents, but was granted with respect to the third corporate agent. Based on those rulings, the widow's petition for writ of mandamus was moot as to the two corporate agent's, but was denied as to the third corporate agent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the adoptive parents petitioned to adopt a child, appellant, the child's biological father, petitioned for a declaration of legitimation, to change the child's name, for a paternity adjudication, and for custody. The trial court granted the adoptive parents' petition to adopt, and imposed sanctions against the father's counsel. The Court of Civil Appeals (Alabama) affirmed. The father and his counsel appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the child was two days old, the adoptive parents filed an adoption petition; 13 days later, the trial court learned that the father had filed a declaration of legitimation and wished to contest the adoption. The trial and intermediate appellate courts found that the father's failure to file a notice of intent to claim paternity within 30 days of the child's birth was an irrevocable consent to the child's adoption under the Putative Father Registry Act, Ala. Code &sect; 26-10C-1 and -2 (1975) (the Registry Act). The instant court held that the Registry Act did not overruled overrule provisions of the Alabama Adoption Code, Ala. Code &sect; 26-10A-1 et seq. (1975), which gave a putative father the right to veto an adoption if the court was made aware of the putative father's identity, or the putative father, having received notice of the proposed adoption, responded to the notice within 30 days. In this case, both circumstances were present. Legitimation and paternity actions were actual claims of paternity for purposes of the Registry Act. As the father's legal position was correct, sanctioning his counsel for maintaining a frivolous action was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders granting the adoption and assessing attorney fees against the father's counsel were reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, Alabama-licensed professionals historically exempt from plaintiff county's occupational tax, sued for declaratory, injunctive, and occupational tax refund relief regarding 2000 Ala. Acts 215 (Act), asserting it was unconstitutional. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) denied movants', taxed workers, motion to intervene and ruled Act 215 unconstitutional. The taxed workers appealed. Intervenors, tax proceeds-recipients, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since 1988, the county, pursuant to Ala. Acts 406 (1967) and Jefferson County, Ala., Business License Tax Ordinance 1120, imposed an occupational tax which exempted certain professionals from its reach. The taxed workers, in a class action, sued the county alleging that Act 406 and Ordinance 1120 were unconstitutional. The state legislature enacted Act 215, a local law, to, inter alia, repeal Act 406 and Ordinance 1120 and to tax all workers including the professionals within the county. The professionals sued over Act 215 and two of the taxed workers moved to intervene for their class. In the class action, the supreme court ruled for the county. In the professionals' case, the supreme court held that Act 215 violated Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 106, because the notice of the proposed bill for Act 215 had left out many of its essential aspects, that it purported to repeal Act 406 and Ordinance 1120; that it purported to tax persons subject to Alabama's general licensing statutes, an issue that was the subject of ongoing litigation in the county for nearly a decade; and various other appropriations and calculations matters. The grounds for the movants' denied motion were moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both the denial of the motion to intervene and the judgment that the Act was unconstitutional were affirmed. The Act was ruled unconstitutional on grounds other than those found by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the supreme court found that the trial court did not err in holding (1) that the Act was a general law; (2) that the storm water fee was valid; and (3) that the county was not required to demonstrate a direct benefit to each person assessed the storm water fee, because a valid fee could be sustained based upon the indirect benefit or a public benefit to the persons assessed the fee.</SPAN></P>

The minor had spoken to a doctor and a counselor at the medical center where the abortion would be performed and had read an article on coping with abortion. The minor's godmother testified she would take the minor to the clinic for the abortion and take care of her after the procedure. The trial court found the testimony of both the minor and the godmother was rehearsed and that neither witness was credible, although neither witness was cross-examined, and the trial court did not examine either witness. The ore tenus rule applied to these proceedings, and, especially becaus the witnesses were not cross-examined, the trial court's conclusions based on its observation of the witnesses, although subjective, could not be questioned on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The center sought to recruit anesthesiologists. It contacted the doctors who were completing residencies in South Carolina. Over several months they visited Selma, Alabama to negotiate contracts. The agreements provided for arbitration in the event of a dispute. A dispute arose over amounts of fees collected and amounts the center wanted the doctors to pay it. Arbitration was begun. The doctors requested continuances, finally filing their suit and winning a stay. The Alabama Supreme Court held that as the contracts required the doctors to move themselves and their medical practices from South Carolina to Alabama to provide anesthesia services to patients in the Selma community, the personal-service contracts themselves were an integral part of the doctors' movement in the flow of commerce, subjecting the contracts to the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The FAA preempted contrary state law, specifically Ala. Code 8-1- 41(3) (1975) on the enforcement of predispute arbitration agreements.  9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2 and U.S. Const. art I, &sect; 8, cl. 3 (the Commerce Clause).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman sued a politician, claiming he raped and assaulted her. She later recanted. The politician accused defendant of paying the woman to fabricate the story. Defendant had a witness sign an affidavit stating that the witness had not bribed the woman to make the allegations. Defendant was tried for and convicted of criminal defamation and witness tampering. He appealed. The instant court held that Alabama's criminal defamation statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-163 (1975), was unconstitutional, as it lacked the requirement that the defendant act with &quot;actual malice,&quot; as defined in New York Times. The statute's term &quot;maliciously&quot; was not interchangeable with &quot;actual malice.&quot; This defect was not cured by the trial court's jury instruction, and the instant court could not save the statute without stepping over the line of interpretation and engaging in legislation. And the witness tampering conviction could not stand, as it this charge was tried in the wrong venue. The crime of witness tampering was complete upon defendant's alleged attempt to induce the witness to testify falsely; this attempt did not take place in the county where defendant was prosecuted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the instant court rendered a judgment of acquittal on the charges of criminal defamation and tampering with a witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) enjoined defendants, state governor, state finance director, and state comptroller, from implementing its proration order as applicable to funding appropriations, or disbursements for K-12 education utilized for payment of salaries in connection with various state educational programs. The executive parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court originally issued an injunction against the executive parties on a theory that the governor's proration order violated rights guaranteed to children of K-12 education by the state constitution. The second injunction rested on a claim that the proration order violated Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 16-6B-9, 16-13-144. On review, the supreme court found that there was an absence of adversity as to the first injunction of the sort necessary to constitute a justiciable controversy because the second injunction rendered the first injunction without force or effect. It also found that the language, &quot;in times of proration, salaries shall not be subject to proration,&quot; found in both 1995 Ala. Acts 620, &sect; 9, and 1995 Ala. Acts 634, &sect; 27 (the directive), applied to line-item transfers by the local boards, not the activities of the executive parties at the state level. It further noted that had the legislature intended to remove salaries from the base amount to be prorated by the governor, it could easily have said so, but it did not. Therefore, the supreme court held that the trial court erred in its construction of the directive and in enjoining the executive parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first injunction was vacated and the appeals therefrom were dismissed. The second injunction was dissolved and the order was dismissed insofar as it granted injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff subject class filed a class action to enjoin defendant county from tax collections. In a second class action, also filed in the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), plaintiff exempt class sued the county for tax refunds. The subject class appealed the second court's denial of its motion to intervene; the county appealed the orders enjoining tax collection; and the exempt class appealed the second court's denial of its request for refunds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county enacted an ordinance that imposed an occupational tax on all persons doing business in the county, other than those exempted from such taxes by 1967 Ala. Acts 406. In the first court case, members of the subject class, those persons who were not exempt from taxes under the ordinance, sued the county to invalidate the ordinance on equal protection grounds. The first trial judge found the ordinance violated equal protection, and enjoined the county from taxing the subject class unless it also taxed persons whom the ordinance exempted. The county appealed, but began taxing exempt persons. In the second case, members of the exempt class sued to enjoin the county from taxing them, and for a refund of taxes collected. The second trial judge granted the injunction, and denied the subject class's motion to intervene. The court and the subject class appealed. The exempt class appealed the denial of its request for refunds. The instant court held that the ordinance did not violate equal protection, because the exempt classifications bore a fair relationship to a legitimate public purpose. The county could collect taxes from the subject class, but not from the exempt class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the first trial court enjoining the county from collecting taxes from the subject class unless it also collected them from the exempt class was reversed. The order of the second trial court enjoining the county from collecting taxes from the exempt class was affirmed, and the case was remanded with instructions that taxes collected from the exempt class be refunded. The appeals from the other orders were moot.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 15-22-26 was unconstitutionally vague on its face or as it was administered by the board.

The discretion granted to the parole board by &sect; 15-22-26 did not make the statute vague; rather, it gave the board the authority to consider each parole application individually. Therefore, the supreme court determined that &sect; 15-22-26 was not unconstitutionally vague on its face or as it was administered by the board and defendant's contentions were meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, petitioner below, a member of the Alabama Legislature, sued appellant, the Alabama State Board of Education (the board), alleging it had arbitrarily and capriciously refused to accept federal funds. Appellant had voted not to accept the funds and also to bar local school boards from accepting them. Appellee sued, following the board's rejection of the federal funding, requesting that the trial court enjoin the board from denying the public school systems the opportunity to apply for the federal funds. Subsequently the board allowed application for the funds and moved to dismiss the lawsuit. The trial court denied the dismissal; the board moved for summary judgment and petitioner moved for attorney fees. The trial court granted summary judgment for the board and awarded petitioner attorney fees and appellant challenged. The board appealed the fees award and it was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother sought a writ of mandamus from the instant court compelling the Madison Circuit Court, Alabama, (1) to set aside a summary judgment entered for respondent doctor in petitioner's wrongful death action; or (2) in the alternative, to certify the summary judgment order as final, thereby making it appealable, or to allow her to seek a permissive appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sued respondents seeking damages based on allegations of wrongful death resulting from medical care provided to her deceased child. Respondent doctor filed a summary judgment motion, based on petitioner's failure to proffer an expert witness with the same specialty as respondent doctor. Three weeks before trial, petitioner identified an additional expert witness to testify against respondents. The trial court granted respondents' motions to preclude petitioner's new expert. Summary judgment was later granted to respondent doctor. Petitioner then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus and a motion to stay the trial proceedings. The writ petition was denied. Petitioner's failure to cite authority supporting her arguments, as required by Ala. R. App. P. 21, provided the court an ample basis for refusing to consider those arguments, and her petition could have been properly denied on that basis. The petition was denied, however, on grounds that the trial court's refusal to certify finality or permit petitioner to seek a permissive appeal was discretionary. There was no abuse of that discretion. Petition for writ of mandamus was not a substitute for an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for the writ of mandamus was denied, as it improperly sought to have the appellate court review the trial court's summary judgment in favor of respondent doctor before the trial court had completely adjudicated petitioner's case.</SPAN></P>

It filed a complaint against the state supreme court justice in the Court of the Judiciary. The state supreme court justice challenged, in federal court and on First Amendment grounds, the application of those canons. The federal trial court denied the JIC's motion to dismiss and granted him injunctive relief. The JIC appealed. The federal appellate court certified three questions about application of the two canons. After receiving the questions, the state supreme court found Canon 7B.(2) violated the First Amendment as part of it was overbroad because it chilled speech made up of unintentional or innocent errors. Also, it found that Canon 2A did not apply to any of the matters forming the basis of the JIC's complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A class of counties and county sheriffs sued petitioner, seeking injunctive relief, arguing he had a pattern of refusing to accept from county sheriffs inmates sentenced to serve time in the state penitentiary and that refusal was a violation of Ala. Code &sect; 14-3-30 (1975). After a hearing, the circuit court issued an injunction requiring the DOC to accept state inmates from the plaintiff counties within 30 days of the DOC's receipt of the notification required by &sect; 14-3-30. The respondent judges argued petitioner was not entitled to the writ of mandamus because, they argued, he had another adequate remedy, he could challenge the order through a declaratory judgment action. Accordingly, the supreme court denied the petition. Should the non-prevailing party in a declaratory-judgment action seek appellate review from the outcome, it could better evaluate the merits of the parties' arguments, having the benefit of a fully developed record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant petitioned the instant court for a writ of mandamus directing the Mobile Circuit Court, Alabama, to vacate its order that denied his motion for a protective order and directing the trial court to grant that motion. Defendant was involved in a civil action involving his alleged sexual abuse of a minor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for first-degree sexual abuse and first-degree sodomy. During defendant's criminal trial, the court allowed the State to introduce evidence of a pattern of abuse by defendant against his minor daughter. Defendant was convicted on both counts. Thereafter, the daughter sued defendant. Her representative filed interrogatories and a request for production, seeking to elicit information relevant to the allegations in the daughter's complaint. Defendant moved for a protective order, arguing the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination shielded him from having to reply to the discovery requests. He argued his conviction was based on only one incident of sexual abuse and that, if he were to disclose any information regarding other alleged instances of abuse, he would be subjecting himself to further criminal charges. The trial court denied the motion. Judgment was affirmed. Defendant was not entitled to a protective order because there was no risk of any further criminal prosecution of defendant for the incidents of sexual abuse of his daughter. The principles of former jeopardy would have precluded any other prosecutions of defendant in Alabama courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Because defendant did not clearly show that there was a risk that further criminal charges would be brought against him arising from the claims of sexual abuse against his daughter, the court concluded that the rule against self-incrimination was inapplicable to this case. Thus, the daughter's representative was entitled to discovery concerning the incidents of sexual abuse testified to in defendant's criminal trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama House of Representatives issued a resolution requesting an advisory opinion of the court concerning whether an Alabama Senate bill pending before the legislature was a revenue-raising measure that should have originated in the Alabama House of Representatives, pursuant to Ala. Const. &sect; 70.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama House of Representatives requested an advisory opinion from the court regarding a pending revenue-raising measure exempting coin-operated amusement machines from the criminal prohibition against possessing gambling devices. The court initially noted it had a duty not to overlook or disregard constitutional demands and to declare acts unconstitutional when the legislature transgressed its constitutional authority. The court extensively reviewed the history of lotteries and the state's case law concerning Ala. Const. &sect; 65's prohibition against the establishment of a lottery. The court held Alabama followed the American Rule concerning the role chance played in defining a lottery. The court held, in a lottery, chance was the determining factor and a participant had no opportunity to materially exercise his reason; therefore, a lottery was not present where a significant degree of skill was involved. The court answered the query by holding the legislation was unconstitutional and could not originate in either legislative house because the proposed video games violated the constitutional prohibition against lotteries where chance was the dominant factor in the games.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Question answered, finding the video games described in the senate bill were unconstitutional because chance was the dominant factor in the games, and no amount of skill would ever determine the outcome where the machine was programmed to win. Therefore, the legislation was unconstitutional and could not originate in either legislative house.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for felony driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191(h) (1975). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. The circuit court denied the motion. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the circuit court. Defendant petitioned for certiorari review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of three prior convictions relied upon by the State to indict defendant were more than five years old. Defendant argued that the title of 1997 Ala. Act 97-556 began with a general statement that the proposed purpose of the act was to make certain amendments to Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191. The title did not mention the elimination of the five-year limitation period contained within Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191(g), (h). Defendant argued that because the title did not state a general purpose of amending Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191, but instead listed particular proposed amendments to &sect; 35-5A-191, the inclusion, within the body of the act, of changes regarding the elimination of the five year limitation period, violated Ala. Const. &sect; 45. The title to 1997 Ala. Act 97-556 clearly stated an intent to amend &sect; 32-5A-191. The text of the act did not deviate from that intent, but simply set out &sect; 32-5A-191 as amended. The subject matter of the amendment was indisputably germane to the subject matter of that section. The title was not misleading, and the portions of 1997 Ala. Act 97-556 that struck &quot;within five years&quot; from &sect; 32-5A-191(g), (h) were valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the instant court found that appellant was not prejudiced by the 14-month delay because he could not have been sentenced to less than life without parole. The instant court also found that the appeals court did not err in finding no improper reasons for the delay because the trial judge relied extensively upon the information found in the presentence report, the lack of which caused the delay in the first place. After weighing the four Baker factors, the instant court held that the delay in sentencing did not operate to deny appellant his right to a speedy trial. As to appellant's complaint of jury misconduct, the instant court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding no actual prejudice where there was no evidence that the juror shared the content of her conversation with other jurors, or that the juror's own vote was affected. Although not an issue raised by appellant, the instant court ruled that the determination of punishment was not a question of fact and that Ala. Const. &sect; 11 (1901) did not require that a jury determine the punishment of a criminal defendant. Furthermore, it ruled that Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state subdivision appealed a trial court's judgment entered on a jury verdict, entered by the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama), where appellee worker alleged appellant's negligence caused him to suffer personal injuries while he was working in the line and scope of his employment for appellant, and appellant asserted among other arguments that it was immune from a suit for money damages under state and federal constitutional law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee worker sued appellant state subdivision and alleged appellant's negligence caused him personal injury while working for appellant. Appellant asserted numerous defenses, including sovereign immunity. However, the trial court granted appellee's motion to strike the defense of sovereign immunity. Thereafter, the case was tried to a jury which returned a large monetary verdict for appellee. The trial court entered judgment on that verdict. Appellant challenged that judgment. It again alleged it was entitled to immunity from an action for money damages. The court agreed with appellant on the sovereign immunity issue and reversed. Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 (1901) and U.S. Const. amend. XI prohibited suits against appellant, a subdivision of a state agency. Even though a 1964 United States Supreme Court case recognized a constructive waiver of state sovereign immunity, appellee was not entitled to rely on that case to maintain his suit. That court's 1996 Seminole Tribe decision implicitly overruled the 1964 holding and its 1999 College Savings Bank expressly overruled the 1964 case, and the court was bound to apply the law as it currently existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed because appellant was immune under the Alabama and United States constitutions from an action for money damages, and thus, the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction to consider an action against appellant or enter a judgment against appellant for money damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried for vehicular homicide, manslaughter, and criminally negligent homicide. She was convicted of vehicular homicide under Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-192 and acquitted on the other charges.

The supreme court reversed and rendered a judgment of acquittal. The legislature had not clearly expressed its intent that &sect; 32-5A-192 was a crime of strict liability, such that some degree of mens rea was required for conviction thereunder. That degree of mens rea was specified in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-2-2(2) to (4) as knowingly, recklessly, or criminally negligent. Because defendant was acquitted of both manslaughter, such that she was not found to have been negligent, and criminal negligence, she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Criminal Appeals (Alabama) affirmed defendant's conviction of vehicular-homicide under Ala Code &sect; 32-5A-192 (1975) which resulted from defendant's operation of a motor vehicle in excess of the speed limit. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's speeding resulted in an accident that caused him to lose control and collide with an oncoming vehicle. The collision caused three occupants of that vehicle to be killed. The appeals court affirmed defendant's conviction of vehicular-homicide under Ala Code &sect; 32-5A-192 (1975), but the supreme court reversed. The supreme court had the same day interpreted &sect; 32-5A-192 in a different case. That interpretation applied to defendant in this case since the defendant's case was on appeal, even though defendant had not objected to jury instructions at trial. The supreme court said that, if supported by the evidence, the trial court under &sect; 32-5A-192 had to instruct the jury on one of the Ala. Crim.  Code &sect; 13A-2-2 culpable mental states. Those mental states were (1) knowingly, (2) recklessly, or (3) criminally negligent.  Section 32-5A-192 was not a strict liability statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the appeals court judgment and remanded for an order or proceedings not inconsistent with the rule announced contemporaneously with this case. The rule was that since the vehicular-homicide statute did not state an offense of strict liability, the trial court was to instruct the jury on one of the statutory culpable mental states supported by evidence: (1) knowingly, (2) recklessly, or (3) criminally negligent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A railroad company deeded a railroad corridor to defendants, county and city, for use as a recreational trail, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 10-5-2.1 (1975). Plaintiff landowners, who were successors in title to the landowners who first granted the railroad easements, sued for a declaratory judgment that the railroad company had abandoned the railroad easements and that the abandonment had caused the easements to revert to them as successors in title. All parties filed summary judgment motions and the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Plaintiffs appealed. The supreme court noted at the outset that the federal Rails-to-Trails act did not apply. It concluded that by selling the rails, crossties, and track material, and by attempting to sell its interests in the corridor before executing the conveyance to defendants, the railroad had abandoned the easements that had composed the railroad corridor. The railroad attempted to transfer all rights, title, and interests to defendants under &sect; 10-5-2.1, but when it abandoned its easements title had reverted to plaintiff landowners and the railroad had nothing left to convey.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment entered in favor of defendants, and remanded the cause, concluding that title to the land composing the railroad corridor had reverted to plaintiffs when that the railroad company abandoned the easements, and there was nothing left for the railroad company to convey to defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Previous owner of appellant's property maintained a sign on it which, under appellee's zoning ordinances, was a legal nonconforming use. Appellee adopted an ordinance that any change in ownership of property would extinguish the property owner's right to maintain a nonconforming use. The property was foreclosed on and resold to appellant. Appellee notified appellant, because of the change in ownership, the sign was no longer a legal nonconforming use and had to be changed. The change in ownership of a legal nonconforming use could not constitutionally divest the property's purchaser of the right to maintain the nonconforming use without just compensation because that right was one of the bundle of rights acquired by the purchaser. Appellant was not required to exhaust administrative remedies when raising a constitutional challenge to a zoning ordinance. An ordinance causing a legal nonconforming sign to lose that status if altered in any way was also arbitrary and capricious as it would prevent a property's new owner from informing the public of the change in ownership, and would prevent ordinary maintenance of the sign.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was reversed because appellee's zoning ordinance was unconstitutional, as it attempted to divest a purchaser of property of the right to maintain a legal nonconforming use already present on the property.

The trial court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment, and the supreme court permitted an appeal from that interlocutory order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was given a pretermination hearing before the chief of police. Plaintiff claimed the chief was biased against him because he helped prepare the charges against plaintiff, ordered an investigation, and helped an officer draft a statement against plaintiff. Plaintiff also objected to the fact that defendant personnel board members were given copies of statements and other materials relating to the investigation. The supreme court found that Ala. Code &sect; 11-43-160, which required that the pretermination decision be made by the appointing officer, did not violate plaintiff's procedural due process rights. Even assuming the chief's involvement in the investigation caused him to be biased, the Alabama Constitution did not require an entirely neutral decision-maker in an employment pretermination hearing for a government employee. The post-termination hearing process provided plaintiff with sufficient procedural protections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed and remanded.

The court affirmed. Plaintiff had alleged conduct that could have constituted &quot;neglect, carelessness, or unskillfulness,&quot; such that defendant was not entitled to immunity under Ala. Code &sect; 11-47-190. When failing to properly recall the arrest warrant, the magistrate was executing an administrative duty that did not involve the exercise of judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Nearly 15 years after construction was completed on their home, plaintiffs' home was destroyed by fire and plaintiffs sued to recover damages against defendant home construction company.

The court applied both the vested rights approach and the common-law rights approach in engaging in its constitutional analysis.

Police connected petitioner to the murders while investigating a shooting 10 days later. Police obtained a search warrant for petitioner's apartment. The warrant listed an erroneous address and did not indicate the search would be at nighttime. A jury convicted petitioner on all counts. The trial court adopted the jury's recommendation and sentenced petitioner to death. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Petitioner applied for a writ of certiorari. The court granted the application. It affirmed the conviction and death sentence. The court held the search warrant was based on probable cause and that an erroneous address and failure to indicate the search would be at nighttime did not invalidate it as it was particular enough to deter police misconduct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of defendant surgeon in her medical-malpractice negligence action for failing to timely diagnose and remove a cancerous growth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In February 1993, defendant surgeon performed a biopsy on plaintiff's left breast and excised tissue. The excised tissue was examined by a pathologist who reported it was not malignant. That September, plaintiff underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy, and other treatment. She sued defendant for medical negligence. Pending trial, the pathologist repeatedly recut and reexamined the tissue, failing to discover malignancy for years. At trial, defendant stated the pathologist's report was faulty, but plaintiff's jury instruction on combining and concurring negligence was rejected. A jury found for defendant. Plaintiff argued the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, it was error not to give the requested jury instruction, there was a conspiracy of silence in the medical community, and Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-545 (1975) abrogating the collateral source rule was unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded for retrial. Refusing to give the requested jury instruction was error. It declined to find the statute unconstitutional, overruling American Legion Post No. 57 v. Leahey, 681 So. 2d 1337 (Ala. 1996) to the extent it held Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-45 (1975)&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed. Not permitting plaintiff to argue and have a jury instruction on combining and concurring negligence allowed the jury to give inappropriate weight to defendant's defense based on ignorance of the existence of cancer. There was insufficient evidence of &quot;conspiracy of silence.&quot; The statute abrogating collateral source had not been shown unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975) and was sentenced to death. The appellate court affirmed the conviction and sentence, and defendant petitioned for a writ of certiorari. Defendant argued the trial court erred in failing to give manslaughter and felony murder jury instruction, by failing to give instructions based on voluntary intoxication, and that his sentence was disproportionate with his accomplices' sentences. The court held an instruction on manslaughter would have been incompatible with defendant's defense. The court held defendant was not entitled to a felony murder instruction. The evidence showed defendant and his accomplices carefully planned the crime, made silencers for their weapons, and lay in wait for hours for the victim to come home. The evidence showed defendant intentionally and consciously planned to rob and murder the victim. The court held defendant was not entitled to an instruction based on voluntary intoxication. Defendant failed to show that his intoxication rose to a level of insanity. The court held defendant's sentence was not disproportionate, as defendant was the &quot;triggerman.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review of a judgment of the Walker Circuit Court (Alabama) holding that 1997 Ala. Acts No. 97-903 violated Ala. Const. of 1901, art. IV, &sect; 105, to the extent it authorized appellant to levy a license fee on appellees, who were attorneys and other professionals, because statutes providing for a statewide license tax on professionals made unconstitutional any local act that authorized a separate levy of a county tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled for appellees, who were attorneys, physicians, and other professionals, in their suit alleging that 1997 Ala. Acts No. 97-903 violated Ala. Const. of 1901, art. IV, &sect; 105, to the extent it authorized appellant county to levy a license fee on professionals. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. The constitutional provision in question provided that no local law could be enacted to cover a subject that was provided for by a state law, and the court noted that state statutes providing for a statewide license tax on professionals explicitly prohibited the separate levy of a county tax. The court rejected appellant's claim that the law was permitted under an exception to the general rule that local laws were subsumed by state laws governing the same subject, where local needs demanded supplemental laws. According to the court, the local law permitting the levy of license taxes on professionals had no relation to any specific county need, and local need in general was not sufficient to justify a local law that was in conflict with a state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant realtor falsely represented to plaintiffs that potential buyers were financially able to secure a mortgage for purchase of plaintiffs' home. After plaintiffs closed on the purchase of a new home, the sale of their old home fell through because the potential buyers could not secure financing. Plaintiffs sued for damages based upon defendants' misrepresentations, and the jury awarded them $ 250,000 in compensatory damages and $ 2.5 million in punitive damages. Plaintiffs accepted a remittitur of punitive damages of $ 1.25 million. On appeal, the court found that plaintiffs' peremptory challenges were race neutral, so exclusion of jurors was not clearly erroneous. Because defendants failed to affirmatively plead mitigation of damages, denial of a jury instruction on mitigation was appropriate. Jury instructions were proper regarding plaintiffs' fraud claims. The award of compensatory damages was not excessive, but the facts did not support a $ 1.25 million punitive-damages award. The court affirmed on the condition that plaintiffs were to file a remittitur of punitive damages to the sum of $ 750,000.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was a retaliatory-discharge case filed by plaintiff against defendant employer. Plaintiff alleged in his complaint that he was terminated by defendant for being injured on the job and for seeking workers' compensation benefits. The Alabama Legislature created a statutory cause of action for retaliatory discharge under the Alabama Workers' Compensation Act, Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-11.1(1975). A jury returned a verdict for plaintiff against defendant and assessed compensatory damages in the amount of $ 50,000 and punitive damages in the amount of $ 250,000. Defendant appealed from this judgment. The court affirmed. Defendant contended that the jury's award in compensatory damages was excessive. However, because defendant failed to challenge the excessiveness of the compensatory-damages-award specifically as a ground for a new trial, the issue was procedurally barred. The facts clearly supported the jury's finding that plaintiff proved by clear and convincing evidence that defendant acted with oppression, malice, or wantonness towards him. The court carefully studied the trial judge's discussion of punitive damage factors and agreed with his conclusions.</SPAN></P>

Each disputed the validity of purported annexations by the other of certain parcels of property in that county. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of appellee, holding that its purported annexation of the disputed parcels had been valid, and against appellant. The trial court also held that appellant's purported annexation of the disputed properties was invalid because the local act authorizing the referendum by which appellant had purported to annex that property was unconstitutional.

Appellee's ordinance was a valid annexation of the property. In fact, the trial judge correctly held that the ordinances annexing phases two through five were all valid. Appellee's purported annexation of the causeway properties did not meet the Ala. Code &sect; 11-42-21 requirement of contiguity. The trial court's judgment was reversed as it related to the causeway properties, with the exception of one portion that was not at issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part. Appellant's purported annexation of property was invalid when local act was unconstitutional. Appellee's annexation of causeway properties was invalid as property was not contiguous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of suborning perjury of his client during a medical malpractice trial. The State's main witness, the defendant's client, refused to testify at defendant's trial. The trial court declared a mistrial. Defendant petitioned for a writ of mandamus directing the criminal appellate court to vacate its writ of mandamus directing the trial court to vacate its order dismissing the indictment against defendant on the basis of double jeopardy. The court agreed with defendant that the lower criminal appellate court should have deferred to the trial court's discretionary ruling. The record suggested that the prosecutor could not proceed without the testimony; several other witnesses were scheduled to testify, but the prosecution felt that their testimony, by itself, was insufficient to meet its prima facie burden. The criminal appellate court's issuance of a writ of mandamus on behalf of the State was improvident. Thus, the court granted defendant's petition a writ of mandamus directing the criminal appellate court to vacate its writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Writ of mandamus was issued ordering lower appellate court to vacate its order.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant beer wholesaler appealed the judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) which held that the local act requiring defendant to provide equal services to retailers in the county containing defendant's exclusive sales territory was not in conflict with statutes limiting defendant's retail sales to that portion of the county comprising defendant's exclusive territory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Statutes applicable to both plaintiff beer manufacturer and defendant beer wholesalers limited defendants' sales to retailers in exclusive sales territories designated by plaintiff, and a subsequent local act, applicable only to the county which contained the separate territories of defendants, required wholesalers to provide service to a retailer if the same service was provided to other retailers. Plaintiff sought a declaration that the local act conflicted with the statutes and one defendant alleged that the local act permitted sales in the county outside that defendant's exclusive territory without breaching its agreement with plaintiff. The court first held that intervenor wholesale association lacked standing to intervene on behalf of its members since its only members affected by the action were the defendants, but the error was harmless absent prejudice. Further, the local act did not implicitly repeal the statutes but only provided a stricter antidiscrimination standard which was not in conflict with the statutes, and defendants' sales remained limited to their respective exclusive territories.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed; although intervenor wholesale association lacked standing since its only interested members were defendants, such error was harmless, and the local law applicable countywide requiring nondiscriminatory sales did not conflict with statutes limiting defendant beer wholesalers' sales to their exclusive territories within the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of trafficking marijuana and of failing to affix appropriate tax stamps. The state appellate court affirmed both defendant's conviction and the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized when police officers executed an anticipatory search warrant at his residence. Defendant appealed the state appellate court's judgment. The court held that, at the time the warrant was issued and executed, Alabama statutory law and procedural rules neither permitted nor contemplated anticipatory search warrants. Without the authority of the warrant, the police officers lacked the authority to invade the privacy of defendant's home or to conduct any search or seizure. Therefore, because Alabama law did not authorize the warrant, the exclusionary rule inherent in U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ala. Const. of 1901, art. I, &sect; 5 required the suppression of the evidence. Accordingly, the judgment of the state appellate court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The defendants filed separate appeals contending that the trial court erred in submitting to the jury a verdict form that prevented the jury from awarding punitive damages against one defendant only.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought a judgment declaring Ala. Code &sect; 8-17-87 violated U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, and declaring that a refund was due under the International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA), U.S.C.S. &sect; 31701(3). Defendants moved for summary judgment. The court found that no evidence outside the pleadings was presented to the trial court. Therefore, the trial court erred in treating defendants' motion as one for summary judgment. However, the court affirmed on other grounds. The inspection fee of Ala. Code &sect; 8-17-87 was not a &quot;fuel use&quot; tax, as defined by the IFTA. Also, a plain reading of the self-limiting clause of the statute, suggested the clause was sufficient to prevent the statute from violating U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. Therefore, plaintiff's complaint failed, as a matter of law, to state a ground on which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought an action on behalf of her deceased husband against defendants hospital and doctor alleging negligence or wanton medical treatment, breach of contract, and fraud. Plaintiff claimed that defendants failed to prevent her husband from becoming infected after his operation for hemorrhoid problems. The jury found for defendants. The court rejected defendant hospital's claim that it should have received a judgment as a matter of law. It was improper to deny plaintiff's challenge for cause directed toward two prospective jurors who worked for defendant hospital, and thus plaintiff was entitled to a new trial against defendant hospital. With respect to defendant doctor, the judgment was affirmed because the statute providing that juries be instructed on the substantial evidence rule under the Alabama Medical Liability Act, Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee retailers sued appellant state departments, seeking to permanently enjoin the enforcement of an administrative regulation limiting the sales-tax discount that could be claimed by a retailer.

The trial court agreed and entered judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court determined that Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-36(b) was a constitutional delegation of authority to the Governor to limit sales-tax discounts allowed to retailers for their prompt remittances of sales taxes, because the restrictions set out in the statute provided the Governor with sufficient guidelines and operable limits regarding the establishment of sales-tax discounts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant driving without his headlights on as defendant pulled into his driveway. The officer asked defendant to approach the squad car and answer some questions regarding his headlights. Defendant, using profanity, responded several times by saying that he was in his yard and that he did not have to answer any questions. The situation escalated into an attempt to subdue defendant with pepper spray. In reversing defendant's conviction for failing to obey a police officer's order, the court rejected defendant's argument that the applicable statute was unconstitutionally broad. The court held that the statute applied to police officers acting in their official capacity and was, thus, constitutionally limited in scope. The court held, however, that the evidence did not demonstrate that defendant failed to obey a lawful order. Defendant was not legally obligated to answer questions about his headlights because of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court reversed defendant's conviction and rendered judgment for defendant because evidence demonstrated that defendant did not refuse to obey lawful order; constitutional privilege against self incrimination meant that defendant was not compelled to answer officer's questions about defendant's headlights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the capital murder of two people, murders committed during the course of a robbery, and was sentenced to death. The court granted certiorari review pursuant to Ala. R. App. P. 39(c). The court was not persuaded that the trial court's ruling on defendant's Batson motions was clearly erroneous. The number of peremptory strikes the State used to remove African-Americans, or the number it used to remove females, from the jury venire was not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of race, or gender, discrimination. Defendant did not carry his burden of showing purposeful discrimination. Defendant, who was 16 years old when he committed the capital offenses, contended that the imposition of the death sentence on him violated international law. The United States Supreme Court rejected the argument that international law should influence rulings under the federal Constitution pertaining to the death penalty. The death penalty was legally imposed upon defendant.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 25-5-11.1 against defendant, his employer, alleging that he was discharged for filing a worker's compensation claim. Plaintiff was fired after he took three days off work due to his pain and to see another physician. Plaintiff claimed that he gave defendant notice of his absence and that one of defendant's employees admitted that defendant violated the statute in discharging him. Defendant argued that plaintiff could not prevail in his action because he was not willing and able to return to work. The court held that, under &sect; 25-5-11.1, the &quot;willing and able&quot; doctrine did not establish an element of plaintiff's prima facie case. The doctrine was relevant to defendant's defense and to the issue of damages. Plaintiff's evidence was therefore sufficient to make out a prima facie case for retaliatory discharge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment was reversed and remanded on the grounds that the &quot;willing-and-able&quot; doctrine did not establish an element of plaintiff's prima facie case. Plaintiff's evidence that defendant's employee admitted violating the statute set forth a prima facie case for retaliatory discharge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendant store and its pharmacist, alleging negligence and wantonness in the incorrect filling of plaintiff's prescription for diet medication. The trial court ruled that a pharmacist fell within the definition of &quot;other health care provider&quot; set out in Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-481(8), and thus plaintiffs' claims were governed by the Alabama Medical Liability Act (AMLA), Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 6-5-480 through 6-5-488, and &sect;&sect; 6-5-540 through 6-5-552. Trial court granted defendant store's motion for a directed verdict as to the wantonness claim, but denied its motion for a directed verdict on the negligence and loss-of-consortium claims. Plaintiffs dismissed their claims against defendant pharmacist. Jury returned a verdict for defendant store. Plaintiff appealed. On appeal, the court held (1) pharmacist was health care provider for purposes of the AMLA; (2) plaintiffs had to prove their case by &quot;substantial evidence&quot;; and (3) jury instruction on defendant's burden of proof was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Possible ways of applying the ruling included giving a refund, collecting back taxes from the favored class, a combination of the options, barring refund if the taxpayer did not follow procedural law in seeking it. Court could refuse to give a remedy in the case that the state relied on precedent and faced hardship. Court needed information as to the position of all parties considering the efficacy of a recent amendment in curing the constitutional defect and its consistency with the state constitution, and hardship of not imposing the tax.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-6-2(a)(1), the appellate court did not agree and to read the statutes in the way defendant suggested would have to read closely related statutes in an inconsistent manner, and would have to disregard the clear legislative intent to protect even nonviable fetuses from homicidal acts; [2]-The removal of two prospective jurors for cause was proper because they expressed clear reservations about their ability to recommend a death sentence; [3]-Alabama's method of performing lethal injection was not cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 15-20A-1 et seq., did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment as applied to defendant, as the residence requirements were not impossible due to defendant's status as an indigent homeless offender or due to involuntary conduct inseparable for his status as an indigent homeless offender.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(10)) and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, his statements to police were improperly admitted because he made them after being confined for several days, and the explanation of his juvenile Miranda rights did not comply with former Ala. R. Juv. P. 11(B). But the error was harmless since the other evidence of his guilt was overwhelming; [2]-The evidence was sufficient to prove he intentionally caused the death of two victims pursuant to one course of conduct, as it established that he confessed to killing them, that he led police to the shotgun used in the murder, and that shotgun shells were found at his home; [3]-In sentencing him to a mandatory term of life without the possibility of parole, the trial court erred by failing to consider the factors of Ex parte Henderson.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 32.3 and 32.6(b); [4]-Because defendant's protection against double jeopardy was not violated, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise such an objection; [5]-There was no need for counsel to request an additional instruction when the trial court did instruct the jury regarding its use of defendant's prior convictions, and thus, counsel's failure to do so did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The Alabama Supreme Court granted certiorari, reversed, and remanded to the court to evaluate the trial court's ruling in light of the evidence the State submitted in opposition to the motion to dismiss and to consider the questions of statutory interpretation that led the trial court to dismiss the felony charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the former Secretary of State and had been charged with felony violations of abusing her office under &sect; 17-1-7(b) as well as misdemeanor charges under &sect; 17-1-7(c). The trial court dismissed the felony charges, claiming that the State was using the same evidence to charge her with both a misdemeanor and a felony. The court concluded that the State proffered evidence in support of the felony charges in additional to that it proffered for the misdemeanor charges, which the trial court failed to consider. The trial court erroneously viewed the felony statute as a broader, more general statute than the misdemeanor statute. The felony statute required that an official attempt to use her position to influence another's vote or political action while the misdemeanor statute was directed at the actions of an official or employee against a subordinate employee. They prohibited two different types of action and protected two different groups of people. The trial court's failure to consider all of the evidence proffered by the State, combined with its incorrect interpretation of the two statutes, led to the erroneous dismissal of the felony charges defendant.</SPAN></P>
