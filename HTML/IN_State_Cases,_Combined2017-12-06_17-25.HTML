Code &sect; 31-33-5-4 (2008) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, a school principal, because no reasonable person of ordinary intelligence would have had difficulty determining whether or not he acted with a sense of urgency when his report of the alleged rape came after a four-hour delay that included doing intermediary tasks, including two hours' worth of unrelated job interviews; [2]-There was sufficient evidence to support the finding that defendant had reason to believe that the factual circumstances alleged by the victim occurred; [3]-Defendant failed to &quot;immediately&quot; report the child abuse because he ignored repeated opportunities to call the police, several of whom were in his building; during the delay, the alleged rapist was allowed to return to the student population and the restroom in which the alleged attack occurred was left unsecured.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6-1.1-24-3(b) (2010) after the U.S. Supreme Court decision; [2]-The statute gave a mortgagee sufficient notice of a tax sale because notice could be conditioned on its request, as it was unnecessary to make an auditor search for a recorded mortgage, assess its validity, and decide if it accurately stated the mortgagee's identity and address, since this was not more likely to provide notice, as it was unlikely a listed mortgagee held an interest in the property, so the mortgagee's request was the more certain way to know who had a viable mortgage so that adequate notice might be sent to the proper party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder in the Cass Superior Court (Indiana). He sought bail and a declaration that Ind. Code &sect; 35-33-8-2(b), giving him the burden to prove he should be granted bail, was unconstitutional. The trial court ordered the State to show evident proof, or a strong presumption, under Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17, that defendant committed murder, and denied him bail, while holding the statute unconstitutional. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the constitutionality of Ind. Code &sect; 35-33-8-2(b) and the denial of his bail request. The supreme court found the statute unconstitutional because (1) the State, seeking to apply the exception to bail in Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17, had to prove it, (2) making defendant prove his innocence to receive bail violated his presumption of innocence, (3) the State was better able to present its evidence, instead of making defendant prove the evidence did not exist, (4) placing the burden on defendant made him, while incarcerated, disprove the State's case pre-trial, and (5) a grand jury indictment was insufficient to deny bail, so the State had the burden. This showing had to be made by a preponderance of the evidence because (1) &quot;probable cause&quot; made the exception in Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17 have no meaning, (2) the &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; standard made the State wait until its entire case was prepared before arresting a defendant, and (3) the preponderance standard was sufficient given the severity of the crime and the attendant consequences. It was not an abuse of discretion to deny defendant bail because the evidence supported this result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On two occasions, some legislators absented themselves to prevent the formation of a quorum. The House imposed fines on the absent legislators. The legislators asserted various statutory and constitutional challenges to the withholding of the fines. The court held that the legislators' claims were nonjusticiable based on separation of powers under Ind. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The constitutional grant of jurisdiction in Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 10, 11, 14 to each house of the legislature over its internal proceedings and the discipline of members was exclusive. Although the courts had jurisdiction under Ind. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 1, 4, 6, 8 to review the case in the first instance, the discipline issues involved were matters of legislative power under Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The constitutional grant of legislative power to compel attendance and to punish members was not limited by either the right to protest in Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 26 or the compensation requirements of Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 29. Legislators who had been absent were not entitled to compensation for services not performed, and they had no property right upon which a takings or due process claim could be predicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A majority voted to allow a judge to be reassigned from a county division to the juvenile division. This action seeking writ relief followed. In partially granting the requested relief, the supreme court determined that the prohibition against transfer in Ind. Code &sect; 33-33-45-21(e) could have been enforced, despite a conflict with a transfer rule that was a part of an administrative order. The local transfer rule did not trump, by way of Ind. Code &sect; 34-8-1-3, the prohibition on the transfer of non-eligible judges because the transfer rule was not a rule of the supreme court. Moreover, the supreme court disagreed with the argument that Ind. Code &sect; 33-33-45-21(e) was unconstitutional under Ind. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1. The Indiana Legislature had the power to create superior courts, and there was no authority for the argument that the Legislature was precluded from providing a method for the selection of the judges for the courts that it created. Finally, a permanent writ barring the transfer of any judge was not warranted because the transfer rule could have been used for efficiently operating and conducting the superior court's business.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 34-51-3-4, 34-51-3-5, and 34-51-3-6 were unconstitutional in a childhood sexual abuse case involving appellee injured party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An injured party was awarded $150,000 in punitive damages as part of a judgment in a childhood sexual abuse case. The trial court denied a motion to reduce the punitive damages award after finding that there was a violation of Ind. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1 and Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20. The State intervened in the case, and an appeal was filed. In reversing, the supreme court held that the jury's determination of the amount of punitive damages was not the sort of finding of fact that implicated the right to a jury trial under Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20. Moreover, the cap did not offend the separation of powers under Ind. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1. Just as the legislative branch had broad power to limit common law causes of action and remedies, including punitive damages, the judicial branch had the sole authority to apply those limitations to particular cases. Finally, the cap and allocation provisions did not constitute a legislative remittitur. The cap did not require a choice between a reduced damages award and a new trial, nor did it depend upon the presence of some error in need of correction. The allocation provision did not change the amount of damage awarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was reversed, and the case was remanded with instructions to grant a motion to reduce the punitive damages to the statutory maximum and to order that 75 percent of the award be deposited into the Violent Crime Victim Compensation Fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grantor deeded its campground to the grantee on the condition that Scouting use continue for 49 years. The deed provided that ownership of the campground reverted to the grantor of the Scouting use condition was breached during that time. After the use ceased, the grantor filed a suit seeking to quiet title in the campground. The grantee contended that the reversionary interest had expired by operation of Ind. Code &sect; 32-17-10-2 or by terms of the deed when the grantor was administratively dissolved. The trial court granted summary judgment quieting title in favor of the grantor, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that the grantor's corporate existence continued on a limited basis, even when it was administratively dissolved. Its reinstatement was retroactive as if the dissolution had never occurred. Next, Ind. Code &sect; 32-17-10-2 was unconstitutional as applied under Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 24. The contract between the parties would have been substantially impaired if the restriction were cut off after just 30 years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended that the school voucher program was unconstitutional. Summary judgment was granted in favor of the parents, and a transfer of the case was granted. In affirming, the supreme court noted that the second duty under Ind. Const. art. 8, &sect; 1, which was to provide for a general and uniform system of common schools, was not read to impose a restriction on the first duty, which was to encourage, by all suitable means, moral, intellectual, scientific, and agricultural improvement. The voucher program did not alter the structure or components of the public school system, and it fell under the duty to encourage. The General Assembly's specific task with performance standards fell under the duty to provide and was not implicated by the school voucher program. The taxpayers' argument improperly expanded the language of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. Under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, the school voucher program did not impermissibly provide direct benefits to religious institutions, and the phrase &quot; religious or theological institutions&quot; was not intended to apply to preclude government expenditures for functions, programs, and institutions providing primary and secondary education.</SPAN></P>

None of the trial court's findings gave any indication that it recognized the presumption that a fit parent acts in his or her child's best interests or that it gave special weight to a fit parent's decision to deny or limit visitation. Both factors were key to a constitutionally appropriate balance between a natural parent's fundamental rights and a child's best interests. The trial court erred by ordering extensive grandparent visitation, without the required findings to indicate why the mother's prior limitations on duration and the father's presence were unreasonable, or how the sudden increase in visitation would affect the child.

Defendant was adjudicated delinquent for resisting law enforcement. The Court of Appeals reversed, and the State sought a transfer. In reversing the trial court, the supreme court determined that there was insufficient evidence regarding whether defendant forcibly resisted, obstructed, or interfered with the officer. One forcibly resisted when strong, powerful means were used to evade a law enforcement official's rightful exercise of his or her duties. Merely walking away, leaning away from an officer's grasp, or twisting and turning against an officer's actions did not establish forcible resistance.

At no time prior to trial did the husband alert the trial court that he took exception to the cap imposed by the Act. The husband was well aware that the limitations of the cap applied to the case.

The court further held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because the victim, defendant's wife, testified that defendant shoved and repeatedly poked her in the forehead and that each of the acts caused her pain. The court held that defendant's two-year sentence was appropriate because he battered the victim while still on probation for a similar offense and he had a lengthy criminal history that included 11 prior adult convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 17-and-a-half-year-old when he murdered his 10-year-old brother. The court held that the trial court did not err by allowing a State expert to testify that defendant had traits of a person with a diagnosis of psychopathy because the expert testified only on rebuttal to rebut the defense expert's testimony that defendant did not fit the psychotic personality. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to life in prison without parole because the aggravating factor of Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(b)(12) was clearly established and uncontrovered as defendant did not deny that his brother was only 10 years old when he died, and the trial court was within its discretion in weighing the mitigating factors, including that defendant was almost 18 years old and his lack of criminal history was offset by his smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol. The court held that the sentence was not inappropriate under Ind. R. App. P. 7(B) given the heinousness of the crime. The court held that the imposition of life without parole to a convicted murderer under the age of 18 in Indiana was in line with the rest of the nation in holding such a sentence was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition to transfer from a split decision entered by the Indiana Court of Appeals, which reversed a superior court decision convicting defendant of operating a motor vehicle as a habitual traffic violator in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-10-16(a). In granting a transfer, the court vacated the court of appeals' opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on defendant's suspended driving privileges, he was only permitted to commute on a device with a maximum design speed of 25 miles per hour. While utilizing a motorized two-wheeled vehicle, defendant was pulled over after being clocked by radar at a speed of 43 miles per hour. At his trial, defendant stipulated to the police officer's radar reading. The court of appeals reversed defendant's conviction on the basis that the State's evidence of the vehicle's speed was too speculative. The court affirmed the conviction. Section 9-30-10-16(a) was not unconstitutionally vague because Ind. Code &sect; 9-13-2-105(d) defined a motorized bicycle, which was not a motor vehicle under Chapter 9-30-10, as two-wheeled vehicle that did not have a maximum design speed of more than 25 miles per hour. While maximum design speed itself was not defined, a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that it referred to the speed based on the original manufacturer's design as well as any subsequent modifications or redesigns. Because defendant stipulated to the officer's radar reading, he could not argue that evidence of the vehicle's maximum design speed was speculative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued, inter alia, that counsel performed deficiently in their mitigation investigation. The supreme court disagreed. Although counsel failed to discover some arguably mitigating evidence, they nevertheless conducted a reasonable investigation, thereby passing constitutional muster under U.S. Const. amend. VI. Counsel interviewed petitioner, his family members, and others who knew him to gain insight into his background and to develop his history; they also gathered records related to his education, his time in prison, and his mental health. Although counsel might have wanted to uncover certain mitigating evidence or might have intended to interview one potential mitigation witness in particular, they were not constitutionally deficient. Counsel sent one of her mental health experts all the police reports that had to do with the public indecency charges as well as all the probation records, education records, and prior mental health treatment evaluation records. Notwithstanding the absence of a completed social history, counsel prepared a three-page summary about petitioner based on his first trial, personal conversations with him, and his records.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, several classes and an individual applicant, challenged a decision from the Marion Superior Court, Indiana, which both granted and denied summary judgment in an action filed against appellee Secretary of the Family and Social Services Administration alleging violations of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12101-12300, and 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 794.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied summary judgment as to 2 classes after finding that the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration's (FSSA) process for eligibility determination satisfied due process. It granted summary judgment to a third class after finding that federal food stamp law only permitted a denial of benefits where there was a refusal to cooperate, and it enjoined the FSSA from denying, terminating, or discontinuing benefits based on an alleged failure to cooperate. It granted summary judgment on a reasonable accommodation claim concerning the individual applicant. This appeal followed. In partially affirming, the supreme court held that the notices used by the FSSA to inform individuals that their applications for Medicaid, Food Stamp, or Temporary Assistance to Needy Families benefits had been denied did not satisfy the requirements of due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Next, federal law permitted the FSSA to deny benefits to applicants who failed to cooperate in the eligibility determination process. The individual applicant was entitled to reasonable accommodation, but the provision of a caseworker or case management services was not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was partially affirmed as to reasonable accommodation to the individual applicant, but summary judgment was reversed as to third class on the food stamp claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Indiana, sought interlocutory review of an order from the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) compelling the Governor's deposition in a contract dispute brought by the State against appellee contractor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor undertook to provide services to a state agency. The Governor, along with several other officials, signed the contract and made public statements concerning it. Thereafter, the State gave notice that it was terminating the contract. The parties filed claims against one another. The contractor served notice on the Governor to take his testimonial deposition pursuant to Ind. R. Trial P. 30(A). The trial court issued a protective order but later granted a motion to compel the Governor's deposition. The court held that Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 34-29-2-1(6) provided an absolute privilege that, upon being invoked, precluded a deposition of a sitting governor. Although the statute referred to a &quot;subpoena,&quot; the court noted that the policy behind the privilege encompassed protection from all manner of interference with official duties and that notice of a deposition provided all that was necessary for a subpoena to issue under Ind. R. Trial P. 45(D). Thus, a notice of a deposition accomplished essentially the same goals as a subpoena and was privileged in essentially the same manner. Legislative intent to provide a gubernatorial privilege against compelled testimony was clear.</SPAN></P>

The Commission and candidate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court had to determine whether the political party's petition was a basis for barring the candidate's taking office after winning the election.

Code &sect; 3-8-8-1. When the challenge was filed post-election the candidate was correctly registered at his place of residence in the election district he sought to represent, i.e., the State of Indiana. The allegations of the candidate's registration impropriety arose before the election and were made public. The political party did not point to anything in their briefs to demonstrate the impossibility of their discovering the candidate's registration issues at an earlier date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State challenged a decision from the Brown Circuit Court, Indiana, which granted a preliminary injunction in favor of appellee, a company making political calls, in dispute over the constitutionality of the Indiana Autodialer Law, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 24-5-14-1 to -13 (2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that the company had violated Ind. Code &sect; 24-5-14-5(b). The company argued that the law violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9 and U.S. Const. amend. I. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the company, and this appeal followed. In reversing, the supreme court determined that an alternative federal free speech argument was not before it. A review of a grant or denial of a preliminary injunction was confined to the law applied by the trial court. The supreme court only evaluated the merits of arguments reached by the trial court. The holding in Mitchell v. Mitchell was not extended to orders granting or denying preliminary injunctions. At any rate, the claim under U.S. Const. amend. I would have likely failed. Next, the trial court improperly found that the company had a reasonable likelihood of success on its claim that the live-operator requirement violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9. The live-operator requirement did not impose a substantial obstacle on the company's right to engage in political speech. A purely economic burden was not the type of substantial obstacle that was contemplated by Price v. State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indiana General Assembly had authority under its general police power to disenfranchise persons incarcerated upon conviction of a crime, so long as the disenfranchisement lasts only for the duration of incarceration.

The Indiana Constitution was not violated when, upon being convicted of Class A misdemeanor battery and sentenced to an executed term of incarceration, former inmate was disenfranchised but only for the duration of his incarceration. The General Assembly had separate constitutional authority to cancel the registration of any person incarcerated following conviction, for the duration of incarceration. The General Assembly could exercise its police power to deprive all convicted prisoners of the right to vote for the duration of their incarceration. The loss of political and civil rights upon conviction and imprisonment was simply a collateral consequence thereof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Porter Superior Court (Indiana) that convicted him of rape, attempted rape, and two counts of burglary, arguing that the use of DNA evidence violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11, because the DNA was procured through a cheek swab taken without his consent or probable cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was questioned by police because he matched the description of a man who had sexually assaulted several women. After the interview, a detective asked if he could swab the inside of defendant's cheek for DNA, and defendant consented. Defendant's DNA matched the DNA from a victim's rape kit and DNA from a victim's apartment. On review, the court held that the taking of the DNA swab of defendant's cheek did not violate defendant's rights against unreasonable searches and seizures because defendant's consented to the DNA swab and his consent was voluntarily given. While defendant argued that his consent was not voluntarily given because the police did not advise him of his Miranda rights, the Fourth Amendment did not require Miranda warning before officers ask for consent to search. The court rejected defendant's additional argument that his consent could not be deemed voluntary because he was only 18 years of age; defendant's mental state or condition (other than a mental state caused by police coercion) was not a factor in determining voluntariness. Further, defendant failed to show any coercive police conduct sufficient to vitiate the voluntary nature of his consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a placement hearing, it was recommended that the juvenile be placed at a facility in Arizona. The cost of this placement was less than the cost at facilities in Indiana. The trial court determined that Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 31-37-17-1.4, 31-37-18-9(a) and (b), and 31-40-1-2(f), as amended by Pub. L. No. 182-2009ss, &sect; 387 (Ind.), were all unconstitutional, and this appeal followed.

No. 182-2009ss, &sect; 387 (Ind.), was constitutional under Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 19. The disapproval of payment for an out-of-state placement was subject to appellate review, but only upon an arbitrary and capricious showing. The focus was what was in the best interest of the juvenile in light of all of the circumstances of a particular case. Because the disapproval decision was arbitrary and capricious, then the Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS) was responsible for payment as if it has approved the recommendation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Commissioner of the Indiana Department of Correction (DOC), challenged a judgment of the Indiana Court of Appeals that affirmed a circuit court's declaratory judgment and injunctive relief for plaintiff sex offender and removed his status as a sexually violent predator (SVP).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sex offender was convicted of a sex offense before the Indiana Legislature created the SVP status. After the status was created, the DOC branded the sex offender an SVP. The sex offender filed suit, seeking a declaratory judgment finding that the DOC lacked the authority to make an SVP determination. On review of the lower court judgments in favor of the sex offender, the court held that Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-7.5 applied retroactively to the sex offender. Specifically, because the sex offender was convicted of child molesting as a Class B felony (one of the qualifying offenses) and because he was released from incarceration after June 30, 1994, the statute provided that his status was that of an SVP by operation of law. Further, that change in status did not violate Indiana's prohibition on ex post facto laws or doctrine of separation of powers. The SVP provision of the 2007 Amendment advanced the Indiana Sex Offender Registration Act's legitimate regulatory purpose of public safety, and only those people who presented a future threat were required to register for their lifetimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's wife called 911 when an altercation arose as he was moving out of their apartment. Officers approached defendant outside the apartment, and he began yelling. When defendant returned to the apartment, he refused to let the officers inside. As one officer attempted to enter and investigate, defendant shoved him against the wall. Defendant was convicted of various charges, but the court of appeals ordered a new trial. A transfer then occurred. In affirming, the supreme court determined that the trial court did not err by failing to tender a jury instruction on the right of a citizen to reasonably resist unlawful entry into a citizen's home. The right to resist an unlawful police entry into a home was against public policy and was incompatible with modern U.S. Const. amend. IV jurisprudence. The right to reasonably resist an unlawful police entry into a home was no longer recognized under Indiana law. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions for disorderly conduct, battery on a law enforcement officer, and resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contended that the superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Attorney General's attempt to recover an erroneously issued tax refund. A motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction was granted. The court of appeals affirmed, and the case was then transferred. In reversing, the supreme court determined that the superior court had subject matter jurisdiction over all civil and criminal cases, except where exclusive jurisdiction had been conferred by law upon a different court with the same territorial jurisdiction, pursuant to Ind.

Here, the case could have proceeded in the superior court because it did not arise under the tax laws under Ind. Code &sect; 33-26-3-1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought a transfer after the Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed a decision from the Marion Superior Court, Indiana, relating to the forgiveness of an assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city decided to forgive outstanding assessments due to a transition from Barrett Law, Ind. Code &sect; 36-9-39-1 to 36-9-39-30 (2007), to the Septic Tank Elimination Program (STEP). No refunds were granted to those who had paid the assessment already, and this action was filed. The trial court entered judgment for the city, and the court of appeals affirmed. This transfer followed. In reversing, the supreme court determined that Indianapolis, Ind., Board of Public Works Resolution 101 was rationally related to its legitimate interests in reducing its administrative costs, providing relief for property owners experiencing financial hardship, establishing a clear transition from Barrett Law to STEP, and preserving its limited resources. Moreover, this was not a class of one case since the Resolution made a broad classification on the basis of a common characteristic. Finally, there was no evidence that the city's action was motivated by animus or ill-will toward property owners who did not have outstanding assessments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a wrongful termination action, plaintiff firefighter appealed summary judgment granted by the Hancock Circuit Court (Indiana) in favor of defendants, a township and its fire department, arguing that his employment was improperly terminated where the conduct that led to his termination was protected speech under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a primary election campaign, the firefighter received an email from an acquaintance regarding one candidate's position on issues that would affect the fire department. The firefighter sent a response to a citizens group supporting one politician's candidacy and discussed several issues. Eventually, a copy of the email was received by the fire department chief, who thereafter terminated the firefigher's employment. The firefighter filed suit, but the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the township and fire department by concluding that the employee's speech was not protected under the First Amendment. On review, the court held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the firefighter was engaged in protected speech under the Pickering test. The email supported a political candidate for public office and was sent in response to an email that was critical of the firefighter's preferred candidate. The email was sent in the midst of a debate on public issues and was sent from the firefighter's home computer, and defendants failed to show any harm or disruption to the operation of the fire department caused by the email.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court noted that the language of the statute was clear; it applied only to a facility that did not accept waste before the applicable deadline. The statute did not apply to the corporation. The corporation's facility included both its landfill (disposal operation) and collection container system (storage operation). The corporation's facility accepted waste by receiving it willingly in exchange for money. The household trash accepted at the corporation's facility was waste for purposes of Ind. Code &sect; 13-11-2-205 (2004). Because the corporation's facility accepted waste before April 1, 2008, Ind. Code &sect; 13-20-2-11 did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant casino sued appellee patron for unpaid counter checks. The patron countersued. The Harrison Circuit Court, Indiana, denied the casino's motion to dismiss, but certified its ruling for interlocutory appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The counter checks were returned to the casino for insufficient funds, and the casino filed suit. The patron counterclaimed, alleging that the casino knew of the patron's pathological addiction and took advantage of the addiction for gain. The casino moved to dismiss the counterclaim under Ind. R. Trial P. 12(B)(6). The reviewing court held that the trial court erred in denying the casino's motion to dismiss the patron's counterclaim under Ind. R. Trial P. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. It appeared that by unmistakable implication the Indiana Legislature had abrogated any common law claim that casino patrons might otherwise have against casinos for damages resulting from enticing patrons to gamble and lose money at casino establishments. The Legislature did not require casinos to identify and refuse service to pathological gamblers who did not self-identify. The existence of the voluntary exclusion program suggested the Legislature intended pathological gamblers to take personal responsibility to prevent and protect themselves against compulsive gambling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, who were a class of driver's licensees, sought review of a decision of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which denied their motion for a preliminary injunction against appellee, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (Bureau). The licensees had set forth the action by asserting that the Bureau had overstepped its authority by defining &quot;legal name&quot; to exclude anything but the name on file with the Social Security Administration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Bureau notified almost 200,000 people that their driver's licenses and identification cards did not match their Social Security records. Within six months, more than three-quarters of those people had somehow corrected the discrepancies. The licensees at issue represented the subset of those remaining whose names did not match, which was about 15,000 people. The court upheld the denial of the preliminary injunction because the licensees had not established a likelihood of success on the merits. Specifically, Ind. Code &sect; 9-24-9-2(a)-(b) required the Bureau to maintain the information on the applications and authorized it to suspend or revoke the current driving license of any person for any reasonable ground appearing on the records of the Bureau. As the Social Security Administration had become the custodian of Americans' basic identifying information and almost all state governments relied on that information to verify identities, the Bureau had logically decided to verify the identities of those with licenses and identification cards with the Social Security Administration. The Bureau was within its authority to depend on Social Security to maintain the verifiable names.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The League of Women Voters filed suit seeking a declaration that it was beyond the power of the legislature to require voters to identify themselves at the polls using a photo ID. On review of the order of dismissal, the court held that voters have long been required to identify themselves at the polls by announcing and signing their names, and neither of the constitutional provisions invoked by the League of Women Voters prevented the legislature from promulgating a new way for voters to identify themselves. It was within the power of the legislature to require voters to identify themselves at the polls using a photo ID. As such, the claim for relief could not be granted, and dismissal was appropriate. No individual voter had alleged that the Voter ID Law prevented him or her from voting or inhibited his or her ability to vote in any way, and the court's decision would not prevent any voter adversely affected by the Voter ID Law from challenging the law in the face of such adverse effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of cocaine as a Class A felony since the offense occurred within 1,000 feet of a youth program center. The jury found that the enhancement was supported by the evidence, and defendant was sentenced to a term of 35 years in prison. The court of appeals reversed on the grounds that the building at issue did not qualify as a youth program center. In vacating the decision from the court of appeals, the supreme court rejected defendant's argument that Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-1-29 was vague. The statute did not have to be free of ambiguities, but had to put a person of ordinary intelligence on notice or provide objective criteria for determining whether one was within a protected area. It did not matter that the building did not have a sign indicating that it was a youth program center or that defendant did not realize that the building regularly provided services and programs to young people. The conviction for the Class A felony was supported by sufficient evidence because the building regularly offered recreational, social, and other programs for persons less than 18 years of age. Finally, the 35-year sentence was appropriate under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 9-19-10-3.1. He was subsequently arrested for having a firearm with a prior felony conviction, and was charged with firearm and cocaine related crimes and resisting arrest. The Marion County Superior Court, Indiana, granted the driver's motion to suppress; the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed and the driver sought transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer who stopped the driver knew him from a previous traffic stop and testified that he was cooperative and admitted he was not wearing a seat belt. In calling in the driver's information, the officer was told that he had a prior felony. During his arrest, the driver tried to escape. The court held that a vehicle, the contents of a vehicle, the driver of a vehicle, or a passenger in a vehicle could not have been inspected, searched, or detained solely because of a violation of Ind. Code &sect; 9-19-10-3.1, the Indiana Seatbelt Enforcement Act. A traffic stop based solely upon the failure of the driver or the passenger to wear a seat belt did not provide reasonable suspicion for the officer to unilaterally expand an investigation. Although an officer could conduct a limited search or inquiry concerning weapons without obtaining a search warrant if the officer reasonably believed that he or others might have been in danger that was not the circumstance herein. The court did remand for further findings concerning whether the driver's conduct created separate probable cause to arrest him for forcibly resisting arrest and battery upon a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR), appealed the judgment of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) that entered a permanent injunction in favor of appellees, land owners and lessees, declaring that a lake and channel were private property and barring the DNR from informing that the lake and channel were open to the public. The court denied DNR's motion to dismiss. DNR appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DNR argued that instead of filing the present court action, the lessee should have undertaken remedies for an interpretation of the dedication to public use requirement of Ind. Code &sect; 14-29-4-5(2) and the application of that statue to the property at issue. The supreme court agreed. The lessee had an administrative remedy. Indeed, each permit contained information about how to appeal. Moreover, the terms imposed by DNR were explicitly set forth in the &quot;special conditions&quot; section of the approval documents. As for whether that language was adequate to alert the lessee to the fact that it was giving up exclusive use by virtue of obtaining the permits, there might have been some basis for debating whether the statute and the permit conditions applied to the channel and the lake or just to the channel. But the lessee forcefully insisted that it gave up nothing at all (&quot;even a single boater getting 'in the way' is an unacceptable interference&quot;) when the statute was plain that at least the channel (&quot;all additional waters&quot;) was being dedicated to public use. DNR gave plain enough notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. The court of appeals disagreed. On the night her husband was murdered, the witness spoke with two different officers. One testified that she was the first officer on the scene and spoke with the witness who told her &quot;the subject was a white male with gray hair, a salt and pepper beard and a plaid jacket.&quot; The witness's stepson testified that the witness told him that her attacker &quot;was defendant who had done yard work for them in the past.&quot; At trial the witness testified that the person who attacked her and her husband was defendant. Also, the witness identified the artist's sketch of defendant that had been previously introduced as an exhibit, and pointed defendant out for the jury. In sum, the State presented an eyewitness who identified defendant in court, made a sketch of defendant shortly after the murder, and described defendant to at least three people shortly after the attack.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was on probation following a burglary conviction, a warrantless search of his vehicle revealed marijuana and drug paraphernalia.

A divided panel of the Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed. Transfer was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a condition of probation, defendant agreed to submit to reasonable warrantless searches of his person and/or property by his probation officer in conjunction with other law enforcement officers. He was also required to behave well and not commit any criminal offense. After receiving reports that defendant was trying to lure a young girl into his car, defendant's probation officer and other officers searched his car without a warrant. The probation officer was not sure if defendant had committed a criminal offense, but he believed that defendant was not behaving well. The court held that a warrantless search of a probationer's property that was conducted reasonably, supported by a probation search term and reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, complied with the dictates of the Fourth Amendment. Here, defendant's conduct implicated the criminal offenses of stalking and attempted confinement. Viewed objectively, the officers had reasonable suspicion to believe criminal activity had occurred. The warrantless search was supported both by reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant engaged in criminal activity and a search condition contained in his probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Indiana appealed from judgments of the Lake Superior Court (Indiana), which found that Ind. Code &sect; 11-13-3-2(b)(3) (Supp. 1979) was unconstitutional as applied to petitioner inmate. The matter arose in the inmate's post-conviction relief (PCR) petition. The inmate also appealed from the trial court's determination that there was no sentencing issue. The inmate had been convicted and sentenced for two murders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate and others robbed and killed two victims. He was convicted and sentenced, which decision was affirmed on appeal. The inmate filed a successive PCR petition, asserting that he was only sentenced to one life term, and that the Parole Board had improperly applied Ind. Code &sect; 11-13-3-2(b)(3) (Supp. 1979) to his 1975 convictions, such that he was denied consideration for parole. He claimed that such application violated the ex post facto clauses of both the United States and Indiana Constitutions. The trial court held that &sect; 11-13-3-2(b)(3) was unconstitutional as applied to the inmate. On appeal, the court found that the sentencing issue was waived where it was not raised on direct appeal, and the fundamental error exception did not apply. There were no ex post facto implications by application of &sect; 11-13-3-2(b)(3) to the inmate, as he was not otherwise eligible for parole. Based on Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 11-1-1-9 and 11-1-1-9.1 (1971, 1974), an individual serving a life sentence in 1975 was not eligible for parole because such sentence was neither determinate nor indeterminate. The court overruled Johnston v. Dobeski, 739 N.E.2d 121 (Ind. 2000) to the extent that it conflicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial in part of the inmate's PCR petition, and it reversed that part of the trial court decision that granted the PCR petition. The court remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to enter judgment for the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to suppress. The supreme court disagreed, finding that the search warrant for defendant's home was valid under the good faith exception to the warrant requirement. Assuming without deciding that probable cause did not exit to support issuing a warrant to search defendant's home, the supreme court nonetheless concluded that the trial court correctly overruled defendant's motion to exclude evidence. Nothing in the record suggested that the detective misled the trial court when testifying at the hearing to obtain the warrant; thus, the issue was whether the detective's testimony was so bare bones and lacking in indicia of probable cause as to make a reliance upon the warrant objectively unreasonable. The supreme court concluded that the detective's testimony was sufficient, as it demonstrated the nature of his relationship with the informant through evidence of the informant's involvement in other controlled buys. The detective also bolstered the informant's tip by testifying to complaints from the public about traffic consistent with drug dealing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of resisting law enforcement; he appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed; it suggested that counsel faced with preparing an appeal in which they had identified no issue of merit should file an &quot;Anders brief.&quot; The high court granted transfer to address the latter issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that discussion of the Anders issue would constitute only an advisory opinion. The high court noted that Ind. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 did not preclude it from issuing advisory opinions. As the issue had significant implications for appellate practice, constitutional rights, legal ethics, and management of judicial resources, and was likely to recur, the high court proceeded to the merits. It found that Anders was cumbersome and inefficient. Requiring counsel to submit an ordinary appellate brief the first time--no matter how frivolous counsel regarded the claims--was quicker, simpler, and placed fewer demands on the appellate courts. Relying on its supervisory authority over matters of appellate procedure and professional responsibility, the high court held that in any criminal appeal as a matter of right, counsel could neither withdraw on grounds that the appeal was frivolous nor submit an Anders brief; counsel had to submit an advocative brief in accordance with Ind. R. App. P. 46. The high court disapproved Packer v. State, 777 N.E.2d 733 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002), and Seals v. State, 846 N.E.2d 1070 (Ind. Ct. App. 2006), to the extent they held otherwise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff students, by their relatives and next friends, appealed a judgment by the Court of Appeals (Indiana) that reversed the dismissal of their complaint for a declaratory judgment to establish that the Indiana Constitution imposed an enforceable duty on defendant state government to provide a standard of quality education to public school students and that such duty was not being satisfied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students sought a judicial declaration that Indiana's system of school financing violated three provisions of the Indiana Constitution: the Education Clause (Article 8, &sect; 1), the Due Course of Law Clause (Article 1, &sect; 12), and the Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause (Article 1, &sect; 23). Critical to their claims was their contention that the Indiana Constitution created an enforceable duty on state government to provide an adequate quality education. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that while there was strong evidence of the students' general concerns, they pointed to no historical evidence that the framers intended more than their historic accomplishment of requiring the legislature to establish a system of free common schools in the Education Clause. In addition, neither the Equal Privileges nor Due Course of Law Clauses of the Indiana Constitution created a constitutional right to be educated to a certain quality or other output standard. Accordingly, the students were not entitled to the declaratory relief sought.</SPAN></P>

The Honorable Frances C. Gull, Judge. On Petition To Transfer from the Indiana Court of Appeals, No. 02A04-0706-CR-351.<BR>Jensen v. State, 878 N.E.2d 400, 2007 Ind. App. LEXIS 2935 (Ind. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals (Indiana) affirmed a finding that defendant, who had been found guilty of vicarious sexual gratification and was released from prison in 2001, had to report and register as a sexually violent predator for life under Ind. Code &sect; 11-8-8-19 (2006), instead of for the 10-year period previously required. On appeal, he claimed that &sect; 11-8-8-19's lifetime registration requirement, as applied to him, was an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant did not carry his burden of proving that the effect of the Indiana Sex Offender Registration Act was punitive and violated the ex post facto prohibitions of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 and Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 24.  Of the seven Mendoza-Martinez factors that were relevant to the inquiry of whether a statute had a punitive effect despite legislative intent that the statute be regulatory and non-punitive, only three leaned in favor of treating the effects of the Act as punitive. The seventh factor (excessiveness in relation to the State's articulated purpose), to which the court gave the most weight, favored treating the Act's effects as non-punitive. The &quot;broad and sweeping&quot; disclosure requirements were in place and applied to defendant when he pled guilty in 2000. Ind. Code &sect; 11-8-8-19's lifetime registration requirement did not impose a greater burden or have a greater adverse affect on him. Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-7.5(g) allowed defendant to petition a court to determine whether he had to remain classified as a sexually violent predator. His direct appeal of his sentence was foreclosed because the trial court exercised no discretion in sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the sentence of death imposed against him by the Spencer Circuit Court (Indiana), following his conviction for the 2001 rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl. Defendant had pled guilty to the rape and murder charges. A penalty phase jury determined that a death sentence should be imposed, and the trial court sentenced  defendant accordingly, as required by Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(e)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Indiana's death penalty statute; the jury selection process; the admission of evidence from a warrantless search; the admission of photographic evidence; and the appropriateness of the death sentence. The Court held that it had previously upheld Indiana's death penalty statute, and refused to revisit the issue. As to the lack of a formal written and filed plan for selecting the petit jury pool, the Court found that defendant did not claim any irregularities nor established substantial non-compliance with the requirements for the selection. The admission of evidence the police collected from his person following his arrest but before a search warrant was issued was upheld as an authorized search incident to a lawful arrest as well as proper under the exigent circumstances exception. The court agreed that the victim's autopsy photos were gruesome but that each was accompanied by the testimony of a forensic pathologist explaining the nature of the medical procedures performed. The court found the death sentence appropriate in light of the horrendous crime committed and the proof of torture and mutilation that was established.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment ordering the death sentence for defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the denial of his petition for post-conviction relief in the Dearborn Circuit Court (Indiana). He was sentenced to death for the murder of a police officer. His conviction and sentence were upheld on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court considered appellant's numerous claims that his conviction and death sentence had to be vacated because his lawyers' performance at trial was so deficient that it denied him the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution. Trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance before a pre-trial mental retardation hearing with respect to developing and presenting evidence of appellant's adaptive functioning, as counsel presented the testimony of appellant's neighbor when appellant was growing up, and appellant's aunt, on the areas of work and self-direction. Counsel obtained qualified mental health experts who competently advanced a diagnosis of mental retardation, as a defense expert found that appellant had substantial deficits in the six adaptive behaviors of communication. A court-appointed expert on mental retardation corroborated this conclusion. Evidence that appellant's IQ score was elevated by an anti-psychotic was not previously undiscovered evidence pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(k) because it was cumulative of a defense expert's testimony on this same issue during appellant's capital murder trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The post-conviction court's denial of appellant's petition for post-conviction relief was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence in a criminal case charging him with possession of marijuana. The State dismissed the charges and appealed pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-4-2(5). The Court of Appeals (Indiana) affirmed the trial court in a published opinion. The court granted transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether, under both U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11, an officer, without reasonable suspicion, could ask about possible drug possession when defendant was stopped for a traffic infraction. From the court's review of U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence, the court concluded that the officer's conduct did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The officer saw defendant driving a moped across the center line and conducted a traffic stop also to investigate defendant's possible failure to wear safety equipment required by Ind. Code &sect; 9-21-11-13. The brief questioning as to whether defendant had any weapons, drugs, or anything else that could harm the officer was not a search or seizure and was not prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. Defendant did not have to answer the questions; his choice to do so and to disclose inculpatory information provided the basis for the officer's further request for permission to search defendant's pants pockets. The contraband question, notwithstanding the absence of reasonable suspicion, was not unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances and did not violate Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court granting the motion to suppress and remanded the cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of child molesting. The trial court ordered two consecutive sentences of 50 years. The Court of Appeals of Indiana affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant committed his crimes before the sentencing statute was amended, and thus the presumptive sentencing scheme applied. The trial court identified three aggravating circumstances, and no mitigating factors. However, the trial court did not explain why the aggravating circumstances warranted consecutive sentences. Thus, the appellate court held that the trial court fell short of the requirement that it explain its reasons for selecting the sentence imposed. Defendant was in a position of trust with the child victim, who believed defendant was her biological father. The trial court also found that defendant molested the victim on multiple occasions other than the crimes charged. The ongoing nature of defendant's crimes coupled with his position of trust was sufficiently aggravating to justify enhanced sentences. Although defendant's criminal history was not inconsequential, his convictions were not significant aggravators. The aggravating circumstances were sufficient to warrant imposing enhanced sentences for child molesting, but were not sufficient to justify imposing consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate appellate court was summarily affirmed with respect to defendant's convictions. Defendant's sentence was revised to 50 years for each count of child molesting and the sentences were ordered to have been served concurrently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Lake Circuit Court (Indiana) granted summary judgment in favor of appellee doctor because the two-year occurrrence-based statute of limitations, Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1(b) (2004), barred appellant patient's Indiana Medical Malpractice Act claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the court had not specifically addressed the procedure to be followed in a malpractice case when a limitations issue could not have been resolved on summary judgment, the court agreed with the prevailing view in other jurisdictions that factual issues surrounding the statute of limitations in medical malpractice cases were for a trier of fact. The court found that summary judgment was appropriate. Claims based on negligence in a May 6, 2002 surgery were barred because the patient failed as a matter of law to pursue his claim with reasonable diligence within the period required by the statute. It was understandable that the patient's focus was on medical outcomes, not legal remedies, in the more than two years following the surgery; but, the legislature prescribed an occurrence-based limitations period, and the patient was charged with knowledge of the law, however unrealistic that assumption may be in a given case. Because the patient's evidence provided the date of his discharge from a hospital as May 31, 2002, more than two years before the complaint was filed, the claim for negligent follow-up or monitoring was also barred by the occurrence-based limitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four years after his guilty plea, conviction, and sentence for child molesting, defendant inmate sought post-conviction relief on grounds of newly discovered evidence. The State's motion for summary disposition was granted, and the inmate appealed. The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing before the post-conviction court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that the inmate sought to vacate his conviction based on his sister's recantation of facts that were presented to police and led to his arrest and criminal charges. However, the inmate's conviction was based only on his guilty plea. It was not based on his sister's testimony. The new position taken by the inmate could not be harmonized with the fact that he originally admitted to committing the crime by his guilty plea. When the trial court accepted the inmate's guilty plea, he waived the right to present evidence as to guilt or innocence. This was a waiver under Ind. R.P. Post-Conviction Remedies 1, &sect;&sect; 1(a)(1), 8. The inmate's claim that because of his limited verbal and non-verbal skills, low intellectual functioning, and mild mental retardation, his sister could convince him to say what she wanted him to say did not challenge the knowing and voluntary nature of his plea. He did not seek to withdraw his plea. The inmate had already served his sentence; he sought only to set aside and vacate his conviction. A guilty plea could not be challenged in post-conviction proceedings by a claim of newly discovered evidence claim on the events of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a circuit court granted the State's Ind. Code &sect; 35-33-5-5(j) motion to transfer property seized from defendant's trash pursuant to a search warrant, the Court of Appeals (Indiana) found that the search was unlawful under the standard announced in Litchfield. That court did not reach defendant's claim that the warrant was overbroad. The court accepted transfer of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Litchfield was decided two weeks after the search and expressly adopted the requirement of articulable individualized suspicion as an elaboration of Moran, which held that warrantless trash searches were valid under Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11, under the totality of the circumstances, if officers conducted themselves in the same manner as trash collectors. Litchfield reshaped the understanding of what constituted a reasonable warrantless trash search. No court had determined whether principles of retroactivity applied to the exclusion of evidence produced from an unconstitutional search or seizure. The court agreed with the Skidmore court that where a new rule was designed to deter illegal police conduct, the new rule was not to be applied retroactively. The Litchfield rule was designed to deter random intrusions into the privacy of all citizens. Retroactive application would not advance its purpose because deterrence operated prospectively. The court found that the seizure of trash did not violate the Fourth Amendment because defendant had no expectation of privacy in the trash outside his house and under the totality of the circumstances, the search was reasonable under Moran.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to suppress and affirmed the decision granting the State's motion for a turnover order.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court granted transfer of defendant's case to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle drove through a red light at a traffic intersection. His vehicle struck another vehicle. Two of the passengers in the other vehicle died, while one person was seriously injured. A blood alcohol test revealed defendant's blood alcohol content to be 0.26. He later admitted consuming about 15 beers that day. A jury found defendant guilty on numerous counts. During sentencing, the trial court noted certain aggravating circumstances and mitigating factors. The trial court then sentenced him. It enhanced his sentences on count two, operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated causing death, and on count 11, operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI) causing serious bodily injury, because he had an OWI conviction within the past five years. The trial court then entered consecutive sentences. The appellate court affirmed. The trial court affirmed defendant's convictions, but found that consecutive sentences could not be ordered on counts two and 11, as those sentences had already been enhanced and a consecutive sentence would constitute an impermissible double enhancement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court affirmed the convictions. However, it found that the trial court had to resentence defendant regarding two counts because consecutive sentences were impermissibly imposed on them after each sentence had been separately enhanced due to a prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indiana appellate court, in a case where defendant was charged with dealing in cocaine, affirmed the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress cocaine found during a search of a vehicle in which he was a passenger. It also affirmed the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress statements he made while sitting in a police cruiser with the driver after the traffic stop of their vehicle. The state supreme court granted transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vehicle in which defendant was a passenger was stopped for speeding. The police officer asked the driver to sit in the officer's police car. Defendant remained in the vehicle. After the officer wrote a ticket, he indicated that they could leave. However, the officer asked the driver if anything illegal was in the vehicle. When the driver said no, the officer asked for consent to search and informed the driver it would be necessary to search. The officer also informed defendant about the driver's consent. The officer put defendant in the police car with the driver; their incriminating statements were recorded on a videotape. The officer found cocaine in the vehicle. The trial court denied defendant's motions to suppress the cocaine and videotaped statements. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that the officer violated defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 because the officer's search lacked probable cause, but found that defendant's rights concerning the videotaped statements were not violated because the lack of interrogation meant Miranda warnings did not have to be given and the statements were made voluntarily.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reversed the appellate trial court's affirmance of the denial of defendant's motion to suppress the evidence gathered during the automobile search. However, it affirmed the appellate court's affirmance of the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress the statements made in the police cruiser. Also, it ordered that the case be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indiana Court of Appeals entered a judgment that upheld the Three Strikes Law, Ind. Code &sect; 34-58-2-1, against plaintiff inmate's challenge that it violated the Open Courts Clause, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, and, thus, affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the inmate's civil complaint. The state supreme court granted transfer of the case to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a civil complaint to challenge his treatment at a correctional facility after he had to be subdued. The trial court dismissed the complaint pursuant to the Three Strikes Law, Ind. Code &sect; 34-58-2-1 (Three Strikes Law), because three prior lawsuits the inmate filed were dismissed as frivolous under the Frivolous Claim Law, Ind. Code &sect; 34-58-1-2. Although the inmate challenged the Three Strikes Law as a violation of the Open Courts Clause, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 (Open Courts Clause), the appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that the Three Strikes Law violated the Open Courts Clause. It determined that the Indiana Constitution did not balance the inconvenience of entertaining a claim against the right to seek redress subject to reasonable conditions. It noted that the right to petition the courts was absolute, which meant that an individualized assessment of each claim was required, and a claim could not be dismissed because of who presented it rather than whether it had merit. Otherwise, the state supreme court reasoned, a meritorious claim could be barred simply because an individual previously had filed too many frivolous claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing the complaint under the Three Strikes Law. It then ordered that the case be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and father divorced. The mother was granted physical custody of the minor son. The mother accepted a job in another state. She filed a notice of intent to relocate with the child. The father petitioned to modify custody. The trial court held a hearing and interviewed the minor son, then 11-years-old, in camera. It then denied the mother's request to relocate and provided that the father would have physical custody as long as the mother resided in the other state. The appellate court reversed the modification ruling. The state supreme court found that the trial court did not clearly err because in ruling it balanced the relevant considerations in the new statute regarding relocation, Ind. Code &sect; 31-17-2.2-2(b), which contained all of the initial custody award factors of Ind. Code &sect; 31-17-2-8 (2004). It found modification warranted to keep the minor son in his present location because relocation would be difficult for an 11-year-old already adjusted to his current community. It also found that the mother's significant involvement in his life meant the trial court's modification judgment in the father's favor did not violate her federal constitutional right to travel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a husband and a wife, brought a medical malpractice suit against defendants, physicians and a professional corporation. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants except on the issue of negligent counseling. The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment and affirmed the denial of summary judgment as to negligent counseling. The present court granted transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1995, the wife was treated for eclampsia. That same year, she was told that a future pregnancy would be high risk. In 2000, the wife, after becoming pregnant, consulted another physician, who told them that the wife had not received proper care in 1995 and that the advice she had been given about future pregnancies was incorrect. The court held that plaintiffs' claims were time-barred under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 34-18-7-1(b) (2007), which was an &quot;occurrence&quot; statute as opposed to a &quot;discovery&quot; statute. Although it had been held that the statute violated the Indiana Constitution's Privileges and Immunities and Open Courts clauses when applied to patients who suffered from diseases or medical conditions with long latency periods, this was not the case here. The wife was diagnosed and treated for eclampsia in 1995, and nothing prevented plaintiffs from bringing a claim for faulty diagnosis and treatment within the two-year statutory period. As for the negligent counseling claim, the alleged negligence occurred in 1995. Nothing prevented plaintiffs from seeking further medical or legal advice. Thus, this claim was also time-barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendants. It directed entry of judgment for defendants on the counseling claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to defendant's probation violation, a trial court had executed a portion of his previously suspended sentence and modified the conditions of probation. The Court of Appeals of Indiana reversed the judgment, directing that defendant be resentenced. A petition to transfer from the lower court was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the provisions of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-38-2-3(g) (2007) governing probation violations permitted a trial judge to order execution of one portion of a previously suspended sentence and continuation of another portion as probation under modified terms. Because the subsections in &sect; 35-38-2-3(g) were connected by the word &quot;or,&quot; defendant argued that the trial court could order only one of the three alternatives. Although the disjunctive &quot;or&quot; normally expressed a legislative intent that only one of the enumerated options was permitted, giving the term its ordinary meaning flew in the face of a clearly contrary legislative intent. Specifically, recent legislative activity evinced an intent to encourage judicial flexibility in response to probation violations. Thus, &sect; 35-38-2-3(g) permitted judges to sentence offenders using any one of or any combination of the enumerated options. Defendant's sentence for the probation violation was not an abuse of discretion where he had repeatedly violated his probation and repeatedly failed to complete a halfway house program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Marion Superior Court, Criminal Division (Indiana), which denied his petition for postconviction relief following the affirmance of his convictions for murder, possession of a handgun, auto theft, and resisting law enforcement in connection with the shooting death of a police officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether appellant was denied the effective assistance of trial or appellate counsel. Affirming the judgment, the court held that appellant did not receive ineffective assistance at trial as (1) a decision to rely upon testimony from the State's witness was reasonable and a failure to procure another expert after problems arose with the original defense expert did not overcome a presumption of competence; (2) because the admission of videotaped statements did not violate appellant's Miranda rights as the statements were made to the media, a failure to object to the introduction of such statements did not constitute ineffective assistance; and (3) during the guilt phase, trial counsel sufficiently investigated appellant's medical, educational, family, and social history. Appellate counsel was not ineffective as (1) counsel was entitled to make a judgment call concerning which issues to raise on appeal; and (2) even assuming that a failure to raise an Ind. R. App. P. 7(B) challenge to the death sentence fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, appellant did not show a reasonable probability that such issue would have resulted in the revision of his sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Indiana filed a petition for rehearing after the supreme court reversed a ruling of the Allen Superior Court (Indiana) that prohibited the State from seeking a death penalty sentence for appellee inmate for a third time. The State sought a clarification of which iteration of Indiana's death penalty statute applied to the new sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted in 1982 of the 1981 murder of a police officer. His original death sentence was in 1982. He was resentenced to death in 1996. Amendments to the Indiana death penalty statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9, were made in 1993 and 2002. Prior supreme court decisions had held that the 2002 amendment, which required judges to sentence defendants in accordance with the sentencing recommendation of a jury, was procedural, not substantive in nature. Considering those decisions, the supreme court clarified its prior order by indicating that the inmate's new sentencing proceeding was to be conducted pursuant to the post-2002, death penalty statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9 (Supp. 2006). However, in accordance with Pub. L. No. 250-1993, &sect; 3 (Ind.), and prior case law, a sentence of life without parole (LWOP) was not available to the inmate as a sentence, even though it was available under the post-2002 version of the death penalty statute. Pub. L. No. 250-1993, &sect; 3 (Ind.) specifically stated that LWOP was to be available only in sentencing phases for defendants who committed their crimes after June 30, 1993.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court granted the State's petition for rehearing and clarified its prior ruling. The supreme court denied a petition for rehearing filed by the inmate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was found guilty of murdering his wife and children and sentenced to death, he filed a petition for postconviction relief. The Vanderburgh Circuit Court (Indiana) largely rejected his claims, except for his contention that he was mentally retarded. Persuaded by his retardation claim, the postconviction court vacated the sentence of death and entered a sentence of life without parole. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's mental retardation claim was preserved even though he failed to follow the existing statutory procedure as the claim had not ripened until after the court had modified Indiana's statutory scheme to comply with the Atkins rule. Defendant did not meet the Ind. Code &sect; 35-36-9-2 standard where two IQ tests and the expert testimony showed that he was not below the level of intellectual functioning defining mental retardation. Defendant also had not proved substantial impairment of adaptive behavior where he successfully held down three jobs, his test scores did not reflect impairment in the conceptual, social, and practical domains, and he had no difficulty caring for his invalid daughter. The lower court's admission of expert testimony was not a ground for reversal as the testimony was not particularly harmful to the State. Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims failed as his trial counsel had sought a competency hearing and had conducted a substantial investigation of mitigating evidence. Finally, defendant had not shown that trial counsel had an conflict of interest as there was no evidence that counsel's loyalty belonged to anyone other than defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the holding on mental retardation, but was otherwise confirmed. The appellate court entered judgment for the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, pursuant to a written plea agreement, pleaded guilty in the Kosciusko Superior Court (Indiana) to robbery as a Class B felony and battery as a Class C felony. The trial court imposed a ten-year sentence for the robbery conviction and a six-year sentence for the battery conviction, with the sentences to run consecutively. Defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and then beat and kicked a pizza delivery driver in a robbery. The plea agreement into which defendant entered provided that the sentence would not exceed 16 years executed. Defendant contended that the maximum possible sentence imposed under the plea agreement was inappropriate in light of his character and the nature of the offenses. The state supreme court observed that Indiana's new sentencing statutes created a regime in which there was no longer a maximum sentence a judge could impose without any additional findings because the maximum sentence under Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-7.1 (Supp. 2005) was then the upper statutory limit. As a result, even with judicial findings of aggravating circumstances, it was impossible to increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum. Further, the trial court's sentencing statement under Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-3 (Supp. 2005) sufficiently identified for appellate review aggravating and mitigating factors and explained why they were deemed as such. Finally, defendant did not show an abuse of discretion as to the sentence in a review under Ind. R. App. P. 7(B). Thus, the sentence imposed was not improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was given disciplinary segregation and ordered to pay $ 8,363 in restitution after he stabbed a corrections officer.

The inmate filed a small claims action alleging that the withdrawal violated the terms of his written agreement with a prison counselor that purported to limit the amount the DOC could withdraw from his account. The trial court decided the case against him. The inmate appealed. The court granted the inmate's petition for transfer and held that the trial court should have dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court held that the restitution was a prison disciplinary sanction, was an agency action related to an offender within the jurisdiction of the DOC, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 4-21.5-2-5(6), and, thus, was not subject to judicial review. The court held that any arrangement the DOC may have made with the inmate to specify how the sanction would be met was also an agency action not subject to judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the surviving spouse of a decedent and representative of the decedent's estate (estate), which sued defendant county for negligently failing to provide requested medical services, appealed the grant of summary judgment by the Bartholomew Circuit Court (Indiana) in favor of the county on the grounds of immunity. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the matter. The county sought, and was granted, transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent called 911 to request an ambulance when he experienced chest pains and shortness of breath at his home. The enhanced emergency communication system (E-911) forwarded his request to a hospital's ambulance service. No ambulance reserved for the county's use was available, so the hospital instead contacted another hospital and asked it to dispatch an ambulance. Decedent eventually died. The Indiana Supreme Court noted that the estate did not allege that a constitutionally protected right is at stake, nor did it allege that the spouse was a member of a suspect class. Therefore, the rational basis test applied. Because, in both the case of a conventional E-911 service and a wireless one, statutory immunity from liability was a reasonable and rational way for the Legislature to have furthered its legitimate interest in better emergency communication systems, the estate's claim that Ind. Code &sect; 34-13-3-3(19) violated equal protection principles was rejected. The estate fared no better under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions by the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) for three counts of criminal confinement and three counts of identity deception. The Court of Appeals reversed the criminal confinement convictions based on Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-3-3(a) (2004) being unconstitutionally vague. It affirmed the convictions for identity deception and remanded for sentencing. Both defendant and the State sought transfer, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant telephoned at least three adult men and falsely informed them of a radio contest in which they could each win a prize if they would drive from their job to defendant's residence, remove all of their clothes and exchange them for a T-shirt. Each of the three counts of criminal confinement charged that defendant knowingly used &quot;fraud&quot; or &quot;enticement&quot; to remove the victims from one place to another. The Indiana Supreme Court held that Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-3-3(a) would occur whenever a person knowingly or intentionally arouses hope or desire in another person to lure or attract the other to change location. Because &sect; 35-42-3-3(a) failed to indicate where the line was to be drawn between trivial and substantial things so that erratic arrests and convictions for trivial acts and omissions would not occur, the statute was unconstitutionally vague. While there was evidence that defendant used information identifying the corporate radio station without its consent, there was no evidence that he used the name, address, date of birth, or other identifiers of any existing human being in perpetrating his hoax. Thus, he could not be convicted under Ind. Code &sect; 35-43-5-3.5(a) (2004).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner shot a police officer to death after the officer arrested petitioner. The appellate court found that petitioner had already availed himself of the rule that permitted a person convicted of a crime in an Indiana state court one collateral review of the conviction and sentence in a post-conviction proceeding. Because he had completed the review to which he was entitled as a matter of right, he needed the appellate court's authorization to litigate another or &quot;successive&quot; post-conviction claim. Petitioner claimed that the death sentence was unconstitutional because, in the course of the litigation, a majority of the current sitting members of the appellate court had dissented as to the propriety of the death sentence. However, in each of the appellate court's decisions addressing the death sentence, a majority of the members of the appellate court voted to deny him the sentencing relief he requested. At every stage of the litigation before the appellate court, petitioner had received the individualized treatment to which he was entitled. A case cited by petitioner was not available to him and even if it were, he would not have been entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a murder conviction and death sentence, appellee inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The case was remanded for a new penalty phase. A second death sentence was imposed. The inmate filed a second petition for post-conviction relief and the case was again remanded for a new penalty phase. The Allen Superior Court (Indiana) granted the inmate's motion to prohibit the State from seeking the death penalty. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that allowing the State to seek a death sentence in a new penalty phase trial would violate his speedy trial and due process rights because evidence that supported his case was no longer available and the jury would likely focus on future dangerousness. The supreme court held that the inmate had the burden of demonstrating that some action on the part of the State delayed his appeal. The supreme court further found that, when balanced against the inmate's own actions, the State's improper failure to comply with discovery orders did not delay the new penalty phase trial for purposes of a speedy trial analysis; the inmate's own requests to disqualify local judges and to conduct additional discovery delayed the new penalty phase trial for an even longer period of time independent of the State's improprieties. As for the inmate's due process claim, the supreme court held that the prejudice he would suffer because of the unavailability of mitigating witnesses identified by the inmate was not substantial enough to violate his due process rights; among other things, every one of the witnesses identified by the inmate as being unavailable were the State's witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the case was remanded for a new penalty phase trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employees brought an action against defendant school corporation in which plaintiffs alleged that defendant had violated the Wage Payment Statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 22-2-5-1 to 22-2-5-3. The trial court granted partial summary judgment to defendant. The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed. Plaintiffs appealed, and the court granted transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that the Wage Payment Statute applied to school corporations. Under Ind. Code &sect; 22-2-5-1(a), the Statute applied to persons and corporations, and Ind. Code &sect; 1-1-4-5(17) extended the definition of &quot;person&quot; to include &quot;bodies politic and corporate.&quot; Nothing in the statute supported exempting school employees from its protection. Next, the court rejected defendant's argument that there was a good faith exception to the Statute. The Statute contained no such exception, and permitting one would contravene the public policy of the Statute, which was to ensure timely payment of wages in the correct amount. Because employers and employees were free to contract for various pay periods under &sect; 22-2-5-1(a), the lack of a demand or request provision in the Ten-Day Rule of &sect; 22-2-5-1(b) did not significantly impair the constitutional right to contract. Finally, if the term &quot;days&quot; in the Ten-Day Rule referred to calendar and not business days, the due dates for many wage payments would fall on Saturdays or Sundays, when most employees did not work. Based on these practical considerations, the court concluded that the term &quot;days&quot; in the Ten-Day Rule meant business days.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief after being convicted of burglary, theft, and three murders, and sentenced to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's freestanding claims of error based on wearing a stun belt at trial were available on direct appeal and therefore, foreclosed in post-conviction proceedings. Because appearing in readily visible restraints was inherently prejudicial, if the issue had been raised on appeal, reversal would have been required unless the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the result as to either guilt or the penalty. Even if trial counsel's failure to object to the belt or lack of finding of need for any form of restraint fell below prevailing professional norms, the inmate failed to establish a reasonable probability that any such objection would have prevailed; he therefore failed to establish a reasonable probability that the result of either the guilt or the penalty phases would have changed. Because the inmate's claims of newly discovered evidence largely turned on the credibility of various witnesses and were rejected by the post-conviction court, they did not undermine confidence in the inmate's convictions or death sentence. The inmate was not deprived of a fair trial or due process because of the jury's exposure to various extraneous influences.</SPAN></P>

Hon. Judges Robert R. Altice, Jeffrey V. Boles, and Grant W. Hawkins.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder. The State made a motion under Ind. R. Crim. P. 12(B) that the judge disqualify himself because of his alleged bias against the death penalty. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) appointed another judge to decide the recusal motion, and the case was reassigned. Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal, which the present court accepted and assumed expedited appellate jurisdiction to address.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the motion did not support a change of judge. The fact that the judge had ruled that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional did not show bias. Although his decisions as to the death penalty had been reversed, they were supported by reasonable legal argument, and the applicable law was subject at the time to a good-faith difference of opinion. Next, the judge's public comments in a legal newspaper about the death penalty reflected his concern regarding the necessity for extreme care in judicial administration of death penalty cases, but they did not indicate that he would hesitate to impose a sentence of death where appropriate. The judge's representation of defendants in capital crimes before he joined the bench did not provide a rational inference that he would be biased in death penalty cases. Next, it was error to appoint another judge to rule on the motion. The determination in a Rule 12(B) motion, whether the asserted facts supported a rational inference of bias or prejudice, was the type of evaluation that judges did frequently. Finally, the court did not decide whether the judge should disqualify himself under Ind. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order implicitly granting the State's motion for change of judge and ordering reassignment of the case to a different judge, and the order transferring the case to another judge to rule on the motion. The court remanded the case to the original judge so that he could personally consider whether to disqualify himself under Ind. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 3(E) and for any other proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Indiana Court of Appeals, which affirmed his convictions for two counts of child molesting in violation of Ind.

Code &sect; 5-2-12-5(a)(1) (2004). The court granted a transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim and touched her breasts while his friends remained in the room and watched. The sentencing court enhanced the sentences from their respective 30-year and four-year presumptive ranges on the following aggravating bases: (1) defendant's probation status; (2) defendant's criminal record; (3) defendant's need of correctional and rehabilitative treatment that was best provided by commitment to a penal facility; and (4) defendant's use of force. On appeal, the court found that the victim's and eyewitnesses' testimony provided sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty. However, the sentencing court erred as it failed to explain sufficiently how a sentence enhancement of ten years would better further the correctional and rehabilitative treatment of defendant than the presumptive term of Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-4. While the factors of defendant's criminal history, use of force, and probation status were valid factors to enhance a sentence, none of them were sufficiently weighty to justify a ten-year sentence enhancement. The restitution and sex offender registry did not require a jury trial as Blakely was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of felony murder, reckless homicide, felony dealing in a schedule II controlled substance, and neglect of a dependent. Defendant was sentenced on the felony murder count to 62 years in prison with 10 years suspended--two years of community corrections, three years of supervised probation, and five years of unsupervised probation. The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant gave a two-year-old child one-fourth of a methadone tablet, and the child died the next day from methadone poisoning. The instant court concluded that sufficient evidence in the record supported defendant's felony murder conviction. The child's ingestion of a controlled substance led directly, if not immediately, to the child's death. Defendant's dealing of the controlled substance was the first step in a chain of events that led to the child's death. The killing occurred during the felony dealing even though the child was not immediately harmed by the pill. The child's death was a foreseeable consequence of defendant's act. However, defendant's prior convictions and charges were neither sufficiently weighty nor similar to the current offense to justify enhancing the sentence. Defendant's conduct was not more serious than the typical murder. Indeed, it was only through a series of stretches that defendant's conduct fell under the murder statute. The appropriate sentence for defendant was the minimum murder sentence of 45 years, which was 15 years more than the presumptive sentence for dealing and 41 more years than the presumptive sentence for reckless homicide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was revised to 45 years. The instant court summarily affirmed the intermediate appellate court as to issues not addressed in the instant court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The Honorable James W. Payne, Judge. On Petition To Transfer from the Indiana Court of Appeals, No. 49A04-0410-JV-528.  <BR>J. D. v. State, 826 N.E.2d 146, 2005 Ind. App. LEXIS 678 (Ind. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, was found to be delinquent. The trial court ordered him to serve a one-year sentence, but refused appellant's request for credit for time served for the 35 days appellant was detained prior to sentencing. The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision. The present court granted transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-6-3, governing credit time, was a procedural statute that should apply to juvenile cases. The court agreed with the court of appeals that Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-6-3 provided substantive rights and was not, therefore, incorporated into the Juvenile Code by Ind. Code &sect; 31-32-1-1. This, however, did not dispose of appellant's claim, as appellant was seeking credit for time served instead of &quot;good time credit&quot; under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-60-3. The inherent differences between the juvenile delinquency and adult criminal justice systems dictated that a juvenile offender was not entitled to credit for time served in detention prior to sentencing. A key feature of the Juvenile Code was the broad range of alternatives a juvenile court had available once a child was adjudicated as delinquent. Requiring credit for time served would impinge upon this broad authority to fashion dispositional alternatives. Although appellant had been given a &quot;determinate&quot; sentence with a fixed term of one year under Ind. Code &sect; 31-37-19-10, this did not mean credit for time served should be available. Using this provision was one of the trial court's dispositional alternatives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a county auditor and county commissioners, filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant taxpayers, three fraternities. Plaintiffs argued that 2003 Ind. Acts 256, &sect; 44, which extended filing deadlines for the taxpayers, was unconstitutional. The Monroe Circuit Court (Indiana) declared &sect; 44 unconstitutional under Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 22 and 23. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers each failed to file timely applications for their 2000 and 2001 property tax exemptions. The statute allowed them to apply for their 2000 and 2001 tax exemptions in 2004. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional under Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 23; it thus did not reach the question of its constitutionality under Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22. It first held that the statute was a special one. Rather than giving the same retroactive application to all property-owning fraternities or sororities across the state, the statute specified a narrow group within the larger class, fraternities connected with a specific university that had been previously granted property tax exemptions but which had paid property tax for two specified years because of their failure to file an exemption. Next, in determining whether a special law was unconstitutional, a court was to look at whether a class was unique and whether that uniqueness justified differential treatment. The class here was not unique. The taxpayers' problems were not different from those faced by land-owning fraternities and sororities throughout the state. The taxpayers' oversight did not justify special treatment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed defendant's convictions and sentence after the trial court entered judgments on a jury's verdict finding him guilty of Class A felony dealing cocaine, unlawful possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon as a Class B felony, obstruction of justice as a Class D felony, and felony possession of cocaine as Class A felony based on certain factors. He was then sentenced to 68 years in prison. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two police officers responded to an anonymous tip that persons with guns were &quot;cooking drugs&quot; at a certain location. The officers knocked on the front door. The officers then saw two men fleeing to the rear of the residence. The officers went to the back of the residence; one officer peered through a rear window. That officer saw defendant pouring a white powder substance down a drain. Three people who had been inside gained access to the roof, and one started tossing away plastic bags of white powder. The officers entered the house and arrested everyone inside. Laboratory tests confirmed that the bags tossed contained cocaine. A loaded handgun and shotgun were recovered, as well as drug distribution items. Defendant was convicted on multiple counts related to the events and sentenced to 68 years in prison; the appellate court reversed. On further review, the state supreme court found that evidence was properly admitted since defendant's search and seizure rights had not been violated, that two convictions had to be reversed since they were not proven by sufficient evidence, that the remaining convictions were affirmed, and that the proper sentence was 53 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit that plaintiff public defender brought against defendant judge for wrongful discharge, the United States District Court, Northern District of Indiana, certified a question for clarification as to whether Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, restricted government officials in dealing with political activity or affiliations of their public employees and whether damages were available if such an employee's free speech rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge fired the defender for supporting the candidacy of her opponent. In answering the certified question, the court did not answer it as framed but responded by ruling that to the extent that tort doctrines gave a civil damage remedy to a public employee terminated for political activity or affiliation in violation of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, a wrongful discharge claim was governed by the Indiana Tort Claims Act (ITCA). Moreover, the court ruled that the Indiana Constitution did not give rise to any such claim and did not prevent application of the ITCA. In so ruling, the court examined federal and state law applicable to such a situation, concluding that there were significant differences between state and federal laws on the subject and that because there was an available remedy under the ITCA, there was no need to consider whether a private right of action or a general civil right to damages under the Indiana Constitution existed. Thus, the court ruled that a terminated employee had no private right to damages under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court also examined the application of qualified immunity, including immunity for a discretionary act in Ind. Code &sect; 34-13-3-3(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that there was no private right of action under the state constitution and that the cause of action arose under the Indiana Tort Claims Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the mother of an injured decedent, sued appellees, two doctors and a hospital, for medical negligence. The trial court dismissed the case as time-barred. The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed, finding that Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1(b), the Indiana Medical Malpractice Act's statute of limitations regarding claims of minors, violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. Appellees sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's birth complications caused her serious and permanent physical and mental injuries. For religious reasons, her mother did not assert a malpractice claim against appellees. Less than two years after her 18th birthday, the decedent sued defendants. She died during the pendency of the appeal, and her mother was substituted as appellant. Under Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1(b), a person under the age of six had until his or her eight birthday to file a malpractice suit. The mother argued that &sect; 34-18-7-1(b) violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, because victims of torts other than malpractice had until two years after the age of majority to file suit. The high court disagreed. The classification of those entitled to legal disability by age and type of claim bore a fair and substantial relationship to the purpose of the Indiana Medical Malpractice Act: to protect the health of Indiana citizens by preventing a reduction of health care services. The mother's attempt to demonstrate that there was a lack of substantial evidence supporting this legislative rationale did not affirmatively establish that the rationale was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court affirmed the trial court's order dismissing the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and found guilty of armed robbery and criminal confinement, as class B felonies. His two 20-year sentences were to be served consecutively. The trial court enhanced his sentence based on a finding that defendant &quot;lay in wait&quot; and on defendant's prior criminal convictions. The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised two issues: (1) whether the sentences were properly enhanced; and (2) whether the consecutive sentences were properly imposed. He argued that his sentences were unconstitutional because the enhancements exceeded the presumptive sentence established by the legislature and were based upon aggravating factors not found by a jury. The first aggravator could not support the sentencing enhancement because it increased the sentence beyond the statutory maximum and was not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. That aggravator was precisely the sort of &quot;fact&quot; with which Blakely concerned itself. Although the second aggravator, defendant's criminal history, did not need to be submitted to a jury, the extent and complete nature of defendant's criminal history was not clearly laid out in either the trial record or the record on appeal. In the absence of a presentencing report, or a more complete explanation of defendant's criminal history and its relationship to the instant offense, the Supreme Court of Indiana could not sustain the sentencing enhancements. However, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentencing enhancement was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for new sentencing, either through a clearer explanation of defendant's criminal history or, should the State elect, through the intervention of a jury. The imposition of the consecutive sentences, and the judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a general election, the municipal election included a contest for a city council seat.

The Recount Commission investigated and determined that the winning candidate had prevailed. Part of its conclusion was based on its finding that two absentee ballots containing votes for the losing candidate were correctly rejected pursuant to Ind.

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords admitted that the code called for payment of registration fees but contended that the entire code was unconstitutional because its provision for inspection of rental units violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution as authorizing or requiring unreasonable searches. The trial court agreed and dismissed the city's complaint and the lower court affirmed, holding that the landlords had standing to raise the constitutionality of the inspection provision of the code, that the inspection provision violated the Fourth Amendment, and that since the inspection provision was not severable, the entire code was unconstitutional. The court agreed with the lower courts that the landlords had standing to challenge the code provision but did not concur that a Fourth Amendment violation occurred. To the contrary, the court held that because the landlords did not live in the rental units at issue, they had no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding the inspection of the units. As such, the landlords had no substantial protectable interest at stake.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a husband and wife, appealed the decision of the Allen Superior Court (Indiana), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, two doctors, and their professional corporation doing business as a cataract and laser eye institute. Plaintiffs had brought suit against defendants asserting medical malpractice. The court granted transfer of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband, already suffering from preexisting cataracts and glaucoma, consulted one of the two doctors, who referred the husband to the other doctor for &quot;Lasik&quot; surgery. Lasik surgery was performed on both eyes as was cataract surgery on the right eye. After various surgeries, the husband was left nearly blind in his right eye. During a consultation with a third doctor over two years later, that doctor told plaintiffs that Lasik surgery should not have been performed because of the preexisting cataracts and glaucoma. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants upon concluding that plaintiffs' action was barred by the two-year medical malpractice statute of limitations set forth in Ind. Code &sect;&nbsp;34-18-7-1(b). In their appeal, plaintiffs contended that, because the evidence showed that they did not discover the alleged malpractice until more than two years after it occurred, and they initiated their action within eight months thereafter, the trial court erred in finding their action time-barred, which was reasonable under caselaw. The court agreed and held that plaintiffs did not reasonably suspect medical malpractice until the consultation with the third doctor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment granting defendants' motions for summary judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted transfer, thereby vacating a judgment of the Indiana Court of Appeals that affirmed a trial court's dismissal of plaintiff abortion providers' challenges to Ind. Code &sect; 16-34-2-1.1 based on several Indiana constitutional provisions, but remanded for a determination as to whether enforcement by defendant state official would violate a woman's natural rights in violation of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After dismissal of their federal lawsuit arguing that Ind. Code &sect; 16-34-2-1.1 materially burdened a woman's right to make reproductive decisions, on grounds that the mere fact of two visits to the doctor 18 hours apart did not violate the federal right to privacy, the providers filed a second lawsuit, arguing most prominently that the statute unduly burdened a core constitutional value protected by Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court noted that it was not bound by the federal material burden analysis in Casey when examining Indiana constitutional claims. Nonetheless, and assuming that a woman's right to choose was a core constitutional value in Indiana, it held that the undue burden standard it used was nearly identical to the federal standard. It went on to find that the providers had not met their very heavy burden of showing, as was always necessary in a prospective challenge to the facial validity of a statute, that there were no circumstances in which it could be applied without an undue burden. There was a medical necessity exception, and women in a great hurry, who might have to seek an abortion elsewhere, faced only what was essentially a fairly minimal economic burden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Having previously vacated the intermediate judgment, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment of dismissal for failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee LLC sued appellant city, seeking a declaration that an amendment to the city's zoning ordinance was inapplicable to 10 permits to erect billboards, and that the city's stop work order was unenforceable. The trial court denied the city's summary judgment motion and granted summary judgment for the LLC. The Court of Appeals (Indiana) affirmed the determination that the amendment was inapplicable to the 10 permits. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the LLC set out to erect the 10 billboards, there was no location permit required by the city. The LLC then engaged in negotiations with the state agency to obtained the permits needed to erect the billboards. In the interim, however, the city reconsidered its policy and enacted the amendment which assigned zoning classifications to the areas in which the LLC planned on erecting the billboards. Nearly a year later, the LLC received the state permits, and began construction. The appellate court held that this was a nonconforming use case, and the amendment was subject to any vested rights in the property of the LLC acquired before enactment of the amendment. The issue was whether, at the time of the change in the zoning ordinance, construction had proceeded on the project to the point that the LLC had a vested interest. No construction of any kind had proceeded on the 10 billboards as the date the ordinance change was officially proposed, or even the date it was enacted. There was no basis in law or logic for the LLC's proposition that its filing of applications for permits with the State immunized it from the city's zoning change.</SPAN></P>

His primary argument was that he should have been found mentally retarded within the meaning of Ind. Code &sect; 35-36-9-2 (2004) and ineligible for the death penalty, but he raised many other constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death under a jury recommendation pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9 (2004), after the jury weighed aggravators and mitigators. The court had previously found that statutory scheme did not violate the Sixth Amendment, and it adhered to its earlier decisions. Defendant offered evidence of mental retardation, arguing that it should preclude his execution. The court agreed with defendant that Ind. Code &sect; 35-36-9-4 (2004) improperly required him to establish mental retardation by clear and convincing instead of a preponderance of the evidence, but since the trial court remarked that defendant had not met even the later standard, reversal was not required. Ind. Code &sect; 35-36-9-2 (2004) required defendant to show retardation both in terms of intelligence and in terms of adaptive abilities. Although the trial court had applied too high a standard in determining the latter, there was no infirmity in its finding, based on clinical standards recognized in a national consensus, that defendant had not established low intelligence. Defendant's other arguments, primarily focused on admissibility of evidence and sentencing procedures, were all meritless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and upheld, with one exception, Indiana's statutory scheme involving determination of mental retardation in a death penalty context.</SPAN></P>

The citizens had filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the authority had no legal control over an airfield and that the statute creating the authority, Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit arose over the citizens' concerns that an airfield was going to be closed. The citizens sought a declaration that the city, not the authority, held legal title to the airfield. The citizens also had sought injunctive relief to prevent the authority from closing, altering, or destroying the airfield. The trial court granted the summary judgment to defendants based on the claims being barred by the statute of limitations and by the equitable doctrine of laches. The court upheld the judgment in favor of defendants, finding that 17 years had passed since the authority had been created. The court found that the citizens did not challenge the constitutionality of the substance of the authority statute but rather the procedure by which the authority statute was passed, namely allegedly establishing special legislation. The court noted that the public expenditure in creating the authority exceeded $ 44 million and that various leases, contracts, bonds, and other obligations were created, some of which extended for 68 years into the future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee fireworks company sued appellants marshal and State to prevent collection of fees on fireworks sellers, asserting that Ind. Code &sect; 22-11-14-5 only required it to obtain one Certificate of Compliance for all its wholesale locations and seeking a refund of fees paid in previous years. The trial court entered judgment for the fireworks company and the Court of Appeals (Indiana) affirmed. The marshal and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fireworks company had 96 locations, and for four years, obtained a Certificate of Compliance for each separate location. The next year, however, the fireworks company tendered only one application and fee for its central warehouse, and then, and without seeking administrative review, filed the complaint. The marshal and the State argued that the fireworks company failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The intermediate appellate court held that exhaustion of remedies was not required in this case because compliance would have been futile, and there was doubt as to the availability of an administrative remedy. The appellate court ruled that there was no question of the marshal's legal authority to license fireworks wholesalers; the question was whether each of the individual outlets selling fireworks was itself a wholesaler. This was not a question of law, but a question of fact properly resolved through the administrative process. The mere fact than an administrative agency might refuse to provide the relief requested did not amount to futility. The failure to exhaust administrative remedies deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured sued defendant insurer for breach of contract and sought punitive damages for the insurer's alleged lack of good faith and fair dealing. The trial court granted the insured summary judgment on its breach of contract claim, and a jury awarded it punitive damages. The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed the summary judgment and remanded for a new trial, in which punitive damages could not be awarded. The insured appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a period of heavy rain and snow, sections of the roof of the insured's building fell. The primary issue in dispute at trial was whether the insured's loss was due to a &quot;collapse&quot; of the roof, in which case it was covered. The court of appeals adopted the modern definition of &quot;collapse&quot;; under that definition, there was a genuine fact issue as to whether there was a collapse. The supreme court agreed with both holdings. Factual disputes as to whether there was a &quot;substantial impairment of the structural integrity&quot; of the building or any part of it precluded summary judgment. However, the court of appeals erred in ruling that the parties' good faith dispute concerning coverage barred the insured's punitive damages claim for bad faith. The insured suggested that the insurer initially acknowledged that the roof collapsed and that its asserted denial of coverage based on its understanding of the meaning of the term collapse was a manufactured excuse appearing for the first time its answer to the insured's complaint. If true, this allegation would allow a jury to find the insurer acted in bad faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated that portion of the court of appeals opinion holding that the insurer could not be liable to pay punitive damages, but affirmed its opinion in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1983, the patient consulted the surgeon about problems in her temporomandibular joints, which connect the jaw to the skull. In 1984, he performed a surgical replacement of her joints using Vitek dental implants. In 1991, the Food and Drug Administration announced a recall of Vitek implants. Although he instructed his staff to search his patient charts and identify patients who had received implants and warn them of the dangers, the patient was not identified until 1996. Plaintiffs then sued the surgeon, alleging that he breached his duty to warn the patient. The trial court denied their motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability. On review, the court ruled in favor of plaintiffs, finding that an analysis similar to res ipsa loquitur should apply and that a showing that no communication was received was sufficient to shift the burden to the doctor to explain what steps he took to notify the patient or why no steps were taken. As there was no evidence of any attempt to notify the patient and no claim of an office fire or other intervening event, the court found that there was no room for any explanation other than negligence attributable to the surgeon or his staff.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that since defendant admitted participating in the crimes, any information about whether the other suspect was involved would have been known to defendant before trial. Also, despite defendant's already knowing whether the other suspect or anyone else had been an accomplice, defendant waited until his convictions and sentence had been affirmed on direct appeal to make those assertions publicly. He had already litigated this claim in state courts and had enjoyed thorough consideration by the Supreme Court of Indiana on both direct appeal and collateral attack.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to 14 counts of child molesting and sexual misconduct with a minor and one count of intimidation. The trial court sentenced him to 267 years in jail, which sentence was affirmed by the Indiana Court of Appeals. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose out of a series of molestations of two victims over a period of years. There was no plea agreement as to the sentence or the amount of jail time. The trial court identified six aggravating circumstances. As to mitigating circumstances, the trial court considered defendant's expression of remorse, his minimal criminal history, and his guilty plea. The trial court rejected as mitigating circumstances defendant's own childhood abuse and his depression. The appellate court found that it did not need to address defendant's arguments on whether the trial court should have submitted sentencing facts finding to a jury since the trial court might have imposed essentially the same 267 years of jail time by ordering other sentences served consecutively. A trial court's authority to order consecutive sentences was not affected by Blakely. However, the 267-year sentence was well outside the typical range of sentences imposed for child molesting. There were mitigating circumstances. Defendant had no substantial criminal history, and he expressed remorse. His prompt admissions and guilty plea saved judicial resources and spared the victims from trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(f) was unconstitutional because it did not require a penalty phase jury to find that mitigating circumstances outweighed aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.

Const. art. 1, &sect; 19. The court held that Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19 did not apply to sentencing proceedings and thus was inapplicable in capital cases at the penalty phase. Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(f) was not unconstitutional as written. The court declined to extend the right of jury trial provided in Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted rape, criminal confinement, intimidation, and battery. Pursuant to the Indiana Repeat Sexual Offender Statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-14 (2004), the trial court found him to be a &quot;repeat sexual offender&quot; and increased his sentence by 10 years. The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence, finding that &sect; 35-50-2-14 violated the Indiana Constitution. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant locked the victim in his car, grabbed her by the neck, choked her, and demanded that she perform a sex act. She managed to escape. Defendant argued that the trial court's failure to allow the jury to find his status as a non-habitual offender directly contradicted Seay and violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The high court disagreed. The statute at issue in Seay specifically assigned to the jury the duty to determine the status of a habitual offender, whereas, in enacting Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-14, the legislature structured an &quot;automatic&quot; sentencing enhancement scheme without a jury trial on the status determination. Therefore, there was no violation of defendant's right under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 to have a jury determine the law and the facts. As to the U.S. Constitution, the fact of a prior conviction was an exception to the Apprendi rule that any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum had to be submitted to a jury. The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments did not require a jury determination of the fact of a prior conviction in order to impose a recidivist sentencing enhancement.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-42-1-1 and burglary causing death in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-43-2-1(2). Due to the aggravating circumstances found, defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole (LWOP) pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(b)(1)(B) (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from the murder of an elderly woman during the course of burglarizing her home. He challenged his convictions on grounds of trial court error in the admission of certain evidence, the constitutionality of the statute under which he was sentenced, and the severity of the sentence itself. The court found that the admission of testimony from defendant's girlfriend that he listened frequently to a heavy metal song regarding night prowling was harmless error because any probable impact on the jury affected no substantial right of defendant in light of the other evidence of guilt in the case. The court had previously addressed and rejected the constitutional claims raised by defendant with regard to his LWOP sentence, and the court held that the sentence imposed pursuant to &sect; 35-50-2-9(b)(1)(B) was appropriate given the relative weight of the charged aggravating circumstance and the mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Johnson Superior Court (Indiana), which sentenced him to consecutive two-year terms following his guilty plea to two counts of child solicitation and which suspended six months of the sentences for a total sentence of three and one-half years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to child solicitation, which was a class D felony that carried a fixed term of one and a half years. The trial court increased defendant's sentence beyond the fixed term under the authority of Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-7 (2004) after it found factors in aggravation and in mitigation. Defendant appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the sentence under the Blakely doctrine. The court found, first, that Indiana's sentencing scheme was unconstitutional because it allowed aggravating factors to be determined by a judge, not a jury, and it allowed such factors to be used to enhance a sentence beyond the statutory maximum. U.S. Const. amend. VI required a jury finding on such enhancing factors. However, consecutive sentencing under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-1-2(c) (2004) that was premised on the trial court's discretionary findings on certain factors was constitutional. The court rejected the State's argument that the Blakely doctrine claim was unpreserved since the doctrine was a new rule of constitutional procedure that applied retroactively to defendant's case. Also, the failure to object on Blakely grounds before the lower court did not waive or forfeit the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of defendant's sentencing judgment that enhanced the standard penalty for the crime of child solicitation and remanded for a new sentencing hearing where the State could elect either to prove aggravating circumstances before a jury or to accept the statutory fixed term. The court affirmed that part of the sentencing judgment that ordered consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a Grant Superior Court (Indiana) judgment on jury verdict sentencing him to life without parole pursuant to the death penalty statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9, and after he was found guilty of murder, felony murder, and burglary in the killing of his former wife.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a person with no criminal history, in a rage at his ex-wife, left his children sleeping at his house, crept into her house, and murdered her. After briefly noting that the Indiana process of weighing aggravators and mitigators to determine available sentencing ranges did not violate the right to trial by jury, the court held that while the trial court could have imposed a no-contact order, for example, as a condition of a suspended sentence, it was not an authorized sentence under the murder or the burglary statute. The sentence did not violate double jeopardy guarantees either, since defendant's felony murder conviction merged into the murder conviction before sentencing and since the separate weighing of sentencing factors under the death penalty statute did not amount to a separate prosecution. Finally, the court refused to grant relief from the sentence on grounds of manifest unreasonableness. Despite defendant's lack of criminal history, his fine work ethic, his education, and his remorse, the trial court appropriately exercised its discretion in finding that the single aggravator of breaking into the wife's house and brutally killing her outweighed any mitigators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee taxpayers brought suit in the Lake County Superior Court (Indiana), for a declaratory judgment that two property tax reassessment statutes were unconstitutional and for an injunction. The trial court found the statutes violated the Indiana Constitution and granted a preliminary injunction. The Indiana Attorney General filed a petition for writ of mandamus and prohibition. The preliminary injunction was also appealed, but stayed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indiana General Assembly passed Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-4-32 (2004) and Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-8.5-1 et seq., which applied only in Lake County of Indiana and provided for countywide reassessment of property for tax purposes to be conducted by the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF) and by private contractors the DLGF selected. The Attorney General contended that exclusive jurisdiction over the case lied in the Indiana Tax Court. The Supreme Court of Indiana found that the lower court had no jurisdiction to hear the claims. The court further found that, although the laws violated Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22 as special legislation providing for the assessment of taxes, Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-4-35 (2004), curative legislation the General Assembly later passed, validated the acts taken under the unconstitutional special legislation. Moreover, the taxpayers waited until reassessment was completed to seek injunctive relief. In the meantime, other taxpayers and local government units relied on the ongoing reassessment process to supply funding for essential government functions. Therefore, the taxpayers' claim for injunction was also barred by the delay in seeking equitable relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The preliminary injunction entered by the trial court was vacated. The case was remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The PD also claimed that the court was constitutionally and statutorily required to review the conviction and sentence and that executing a mentally ill person was unconstitutional. Defendant subsequently recanted his waiver. The State challenged the PD's standing to raise any issues other than a challenge to the competency finding. The court found that defendant did not file a PCR petition, the time to do so under Ind. R. Crim. P. 24(G)(2) had passed, and the issues on appeal were best decided promptly, so dismissal was denied. The evidence supported a conclusion that defendant could understand his legal position and was rational when he waived review, so the proper competency standard was applied. Moreover, the PD lacked standing to raise the other issues without defendant's consent. Finally, the court refused to extend automatic PCR to all death sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, ab owner and a trustee, sought review of the judgment of the Lake Superior Court (Indiana) finding that defendant town did not err in denying the request by the owner and trustee to rezone half of their parcel so that the entire parcel was zoned as commercial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner petitioned the town's plan commission to rezone the entire parcel for commercial use, as the owner intended to build a gas station. Opponents to the rezoning testified about existing traffic congestion in the area and expressed concerns that rezoning would aggravate the situation and would compromise safety. They favored road construction to fix the traffic problem before any new commercial development. The local comprehensive plan envisioned commercial zoning of the entire parcel at some point in the future. The commission denied the rezoning. Under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 36-7-4-603, the commission was to pay reasonable regard to a number of factors, only one of which was the comprehensive plan. Contrary to the argument of the owner and trustee, the town did not ignore the comprehensive plan. The commission and the town council determined that traffic congestion in the area had to be addressed before rezoning occurred. This issue, combined with concerns for nearby property values, provided a rational basis for the town's decision. Although these concerns did not address the comprehensive plan, it did not follow that the town ignored this factor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of murder. During trial, defendant became ill and made various motions for mistrial, all of which were denied. The jury found defendant guilty as charged and recommended a death sentence. The Vanderburgh Circuit Court (Indiana) sentenced defendant to death and denied his motion to correct errors. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Indiana's death penalty statute in effect at the time of his sentencing violated the Sixth and Eighth Amendments. In upholding the statute's constitutionality, the supreme court concluded that the statute's requirement that the jury find at least one aggravating circumstance in order to recommend the death penalty met the requirements of Ring and Apprendi and that instructing the jury that its sentence recommendation was not binding did not unconstitutionally lead the jury to feel less responsible than it should for the sentencing decision. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in denying his motions for a mistrial because he was incompetent to stand trial. The supreme court found no clear error in the trial court's decision, noting that there was testimony that the medications defendant was on assisted him in participating in his trial and were not used to medicate a diagnosed psychosis. Finally, the supreme court found defendant's death sentence to be appropriate. The supreme court noted that the aggravating factors, the commission of multiple murders and the age of the children, outweighed the mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The HMOs were members of the ICHIA and were required to help contribute to the ICHIA's losses. The HMOs argued the ICHIA's assessment methods allocated a disproportionate share of ICHIA's losses to the HMOs and the HMOs sought a declaratory judgment that the methods were improper. The trial court dismissed the action, but the lower appellate court reversed that dismissal. The court found that whether the ICHIA was viewed as a private association or a state agency, exhaustion of its internal remedies, including appeals to the ICHIA and the Commissioner, was required before a member HMO could resort to litigation to challenge an assessment. While the HMOs argued that even if the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies applied, exceptions to that doctrine excused exhaustion. The court found the HMOs did not suggest that either ICHIA or the Commissioner was powerless to effect a remedy, so futility was not available. The court also rejected the HMOs other exception arguments because they raised issues best left to an initial determination by the ICHIA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of murdering a police officer, appealed his conviction and sentence of the death penalty by the Marion Superior Court (Indiana). Because the victim was a law enforcement officer, the prosecutor sought the death penalty. Defendant argued, inter alia, that Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9 (2003) was unconstitutional. Defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence that he had the requisite mens rea to commit murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot the police officer while he was trying to escape on foot after stealing a van. The appellate court held there was no merit to the contention that lethal injection was a per se violation of the Eighth Amendment. Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9 was not unconstitutional. The changes in &sect; 35-50-2-9 which occurred after defendant was charged were procedural in nature for purposes of the ex post facto doctrine. The jurors' weighing of mitigating and aggravating factors was not required to be done under a reasonable doubt standard. Once a statutory aggravator was found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the Sixth Amendment was satisfied. There was no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct in regard to charging a witness with a crime. It was within the trial court's discretion to determine that a reference to a tattoo in violation of a court order was not so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial. Shooting a handgun, even if merely shooting backwards without stopping and aiming, in an effort to &quot;slow down&quot; a pursuing officer met the test of &quot;knowing&quot; for purpose of a murder conviction. The mere fact that a juror was upset with defendant's attorney did not warrant a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed an interlocutory appeal from an order of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) dismissing the State's request for the death penalty and ordering a sentencing proceeding where a term of years was the only question. Defendant's death sentence was imposed after a jury found him guilty of two counts of murder and one count each of kidnapping, confinement, burglary, and carrying a handgun without a license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that the trial court erred in concluding that, because it did not require a penalty phase jury to find that mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, the Indiana death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The State's appeal argued that weighing was not a fact that required proof beyond reasonable doubt. It also urged that the requirement for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt any fact that made a murder defendant eligible for the death penalty applied only to aggravating circumstances under the Indiana scheme. The supreme court concluded that the trial court erred and that there was no constitutional requirement that the weighing factor be found beyond a reasonable doubt. As for defendant's contention that the trial court's finding that Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(f) was unconstitutional should have been affirmed because the statute unconstitutionally permitted a death sentence to be imposed by a judge alone in cases where the jury could not reach a sentencing decision, the supreme court concluded that the statute was not unconstitutional as written and thus, did not impede the State's request for the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the death penalty request. It concluded that Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9 was unconstitutional because it permitted a sentence of death without requiring the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance or circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances, which the trial court believed violated Apprendi. The State contended that the trial court erred in concluding that, because it did not require a penalty-phase jury to find that mitigating circumstances outweighed aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, the Indiana death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that &sect; 35-50-2-9 did not violate the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by Apprendi and Ring. Because the weighing factor did not need to be found beyond a reasonable doubt, the omission of such a requirement in &sect; 35-50-2-9(l) did not render the statute unconstitutional.

The search warrant was supported by adequate probable cause. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting 10 photographs into evidence of the murder scene and the victims. The court found that the 2002 amendment to the penalty statute did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, and therefore the trial court was required to sentence defendant in accordance with the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment without parole.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, robbery, and confinement, and was sentenced to death. The convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Defendant then sought post-conviction relief. The Madison Superior Court (Indiana) denied post-conviction relief, and that denial was affirmed. Defendant then sought rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death despite a unanimous jury recommendation otherwise. At the time of the trial and direct appeal, the judge was authorized to override a jury recommendation if the statutory aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Since then, the United States Supreme Court decided Apprendi, and the Indiana general assembly amended Indiana's death penalty statute to remove the authority to impose death if the jury recommended against it. It was unnecessary for the appellate court to rule on the retroactivity of these changes. Under Ind. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4 and Ind. R. App. P. 7(B), the appellate court had the power to review and revise sentences. Even if the Sixth Amendment did not bar defendant's execution, defendant, if tried currently, could not be sentenced to death without a jury recommendation that death be imposed. The death sentence was thus inappropriate and was revised. At the time of defendant's crime, the punishment of life without parole was unavailable, and a term of years was required. Two death penalty aggravating circumstances were found, and the mitigating circumstances were entitled to little weight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was revised. The case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to enter a sentence of 60 years for murder, 20 years for robbery, and 20 years for confinement, all to be served consecutively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant applied for reconsideration of the denial of his petition under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(k) (2003) in which defendant sought to challenge a judgment from the Lake Superior Court (Indiana), which convicted him for murder and sentenced him to death. Defendant also made other motions, including several requests to supplement the record with additional materials and for funds to conduct additional investigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death for multiple murders committed during a robbery. Since that conviction, defendant had the convictions and the sentence reviewed on the merits by a state trial court in his first post-conviction proceeding, twice on appeal by the court, and by all three levels of the federal judiciary. The United States Supreme Court declined to hear his case three times. Defendant made a final petition under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(k) (2003), which allowed people sentenced to the death penalty who completed their post-conviction proceedings to petition to present new evidence challenging guilt. That petition was denied and defendant sought rehearing. The court found to the extent any issue not related to new evidence was presented, it was either waived or procedurally defaulted. The court also found there was no new evidence rendering the convictions or the sentence unreliable. The death sentence was not unconstitutional, the co-defendant could avoid the death penalty by reason of mental deficiency without invalidating defendant's death sentence, and sufficient evidence outside of blood evidence existed on the death sentence factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion for rehearing and affirmed defendant's conviction for murder and sentence of death. The court granted the motion to supplement the record, but denied the motion for funds to conduct additional investigation.</SPAN></P>

The Boone Superior Court (Indiana) granted the agency's summary judgment motion. The company appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company's facility processed trees, brush, leaves, grass, and dirt, and sold the resultant mulch. The company also processed concrete and bricks and sold the resultant stone. The management district was created by Ind. Code art. 13-21 to regulate solid waste management in the area. The management district claimed that the company's operation was an illegal and unpermitted site. The parties initially agreed to engage in a permit application process before the company brought the instant action. The company argued that because the conduct regulated in the permit was regulated by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, the agency's power to regulate the company's facility was preempted by Ind. Code &sect; 36-1-3-8(a)(7) (1998). The court held that the Indiana Home Rule Act did not prohibit solid waste management districts from regulating solid waste. The specific grant of authority in the Solid Waste Management District Act governed over the general terms of the Home Rule Act. The court further held that the prohibitions against ex parte communications that applied to administrative agencies and to courts did not apply to the management district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county sued appellant state natural resources department, contending that a sale of land to the department was void as in violation of the Newton County, Indiana, Farm Preservation Ordinance, and the Newton County, Indiana, Land Acquisition Notice Act. The Jasper Superior Court (Indiana) set aside the land sale and found that Ind. Code &sect; 14-22-8-7(c) (1998) was unconstitutional. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Farm Preservation Ordinance and the Land Acquisition Notice Act imposed requirements on purchases of land in the county by governmental agencies, and the acquisition at issue did not follow the dictated procedures. The trial court found that the sale violated the ordinances, and that Ind. Code &sect; 14-22-8-7(c) (1998) of the Game Bird Habitat Act was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court held that the Home Rule Act, Ind. Code &sect; 36-1-3-1 (1998) et seq., expressly prohibited the imposition of duties on other units of local government. The Game Bird Habitat Act expressly granted the department the authority to acquire land to achieve its purposes, and the ordinances sought to regulate the state in that activity. This was not within the county's power. The legislature did not need to supply more specific definitions for the terms &quot;willing seller&quot; and &quot;game bird habitat&quot; in Ind. Code &sect; 14-22-8-7(c) (1998) to guide the department. There was no doubt that the property owner was a willing seller. There was no evidence that the department interpreted the terms &quot;game bird&quot; or &quot;habitat&quot; improperly with respect to the acquisition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded with instructions to dismiss the county's complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was transferred from the Court of Appeals of Indiana reversing the trial court's convictions of defendant for operating a motor vehicle with a specific amount of alcohol in the body, operating while intoxicated, and operating while intoxicated within five years of a previous conviction for the same offense. In the process, the appellate court determined that Ind. Code &sect; 35-21-2-1(i) (2000) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The road on which defendant was driving drunk formed the boundary between two counties, the county in which the trial court sat and another county. The boundary was the middle of the road. Although the side of the road on which defendant was travelling when he drove drunk was in the other county, charges were brought in the trial court's county. Defendant asserted on appeal that Ind. Code &sect; 35-32-2-1(i) (2000), which provided for venue in either county when the crime occurred on a highway bordering two counties, was unconstitutional. Defendant asserted that he had a right under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 and Ind. Code &sect; 35-32-2-1(a) (2000) to be tried in the county where the offense was committed. The reviewing court found that Ind. Code &sect; 35-32-2-1(i) was constitutional. The legislature was permitted to establish concurrent venue for violations on or near county borders. Defendant's drunk driving had a sufficient nexus with the trial court's jurisdiction for defendant to be tried there. Defendant's dangerous operation of the vehicle on one side of the road endangered those on the other side of the road as well.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-32-2-1(i) (2000) was unconstitutional as applied to ham, and that as the evidence was clear that defendant never crossed the border into another county, the Indiana Constitution limited venue to the county where the driving occurred. The trial court held that the venue statute conferred venue on Hamilton County. The appellate court found that the statute could not confer venue over crimes where the evidence pointed to only one county as the location of the offense. The supreme court found that concurrent venue was constitutional for offenses committed by operating a vehicle on a highway forming the boundary between two counties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs nursing homes sought a declaratory judgment that certain legislation became law despite the governor's veto. The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendant governor, but the Court of Appeals (Indiana) reversed. The governor sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nursing homes said the veto was ineffective because the governor's veto message was delivered to the legislature six months before Ind. Const. art. V, &sect; 14(a)(2)(D) called for it to be returned. The supreme court held its interest in previously vetoed judicial pay raise legislation, which its decision would affect, normally precluded participation in the case, but there was no one else to decide the case. The governor's veto was sustained. Under the de minimis doctrine, there were no practical consequences of the governor's delivery of the vetoed bill to the legislature before the legislature reconvened, rather than on that date. The veto message met the objective of art. V, &sect; 14(a)(2)(D) of assuring the legislature would have the earliest possible opportunity to consider the veto. The veto substantially conformed to the constitutionally prescribed process, so it was properly returned to the legislature. Section 14 put a deadline on the governor's physical return of vetoed legislation to the legislature, when it was not in session, but allowed it to be done at any time, as long as the result was a return on the first day of the next legislative session.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted plaintiff taxpayers' petition for transfer of their appeal from an affirmance, by the Indiana Court of Appeals, of a trial court's summary judgment denying relief in a constitutional challenge to defendant state officials' promulgation of an interpretation of Ind. Code &sect; 21-3-1.6-1.1 as allowing a dual enrollment process in determining public school entitlement to state aid, arguing that it violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 21-3-1.6-1.1 allowed school districts, in determining their average daily membership of students for state funding purposes, to count (proportionately, under a subsequent amendment) students in private, including parochial, schools in their figures. The taxpayers argued that this practice allowed religious schools to save money by not spending money on staff and positions in such areas as computer science and foreign languages. The high court first held that the taxpayers had standing under Indiana's public standing doctrine. Nonetheless, their appeal failed. Looking to the history of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, to Indiana case law interpreting it, and to case law in other states interpreting nearly identical provisions, the high court held that the fact that a law conferred a purely incidental benefit on a religiously oriented institution was not grounds for invalidating it. The public schools benefited financially, and an incidental result was that parochial schools saved on certain expenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the aggravating circumstance of torture. Although defendant's actions were despicable, the supreme court found that they did not exceed the scope of murder or molestation. Defendant did not attempt to coerce the victim through torturous acts, nor did he appear to indulge in sadistic acts. Defendant also contended that the trial court abused its discretion in weighing various mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Defendant alleged that the trial court gave inadequate weight to several of the circumstances it found as mitigating. The supreme court found no error noting, inter alia, that although statutory mitigators did exist, no credible evidence was sufficient to excuse of explain defendant's behavior. Finally, defendant argued that he was sentenced to life without parole under a facially and structurally unconstitutional statutory sentencing scheme. The supreme court noted that with his plea of guilty, defendant forfeited claimed entitlement to certain rights including that of a jury trial. Thus, contrary to defendant's argument, his sentence did not conflict with Apprendi or Ring.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 12-15-5-1 and 16-34-1-2 and a related regulation violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Code tit. 405, r. 5-28-7, which defined abortions as medically necessary and covered by Medicaid only if performed to preserve the patient's life or in situations involving rape or incest. The high court applied Indiana's Collins standard in determining whether the disparate treatment accorded different pregnant women was reasonably related to inherent characteristics that distinguished the classes, and found no manifest unreasonableness in the distinctions. It also found that the standards were uniformly applicable to the various women who fell into the class. Nonetheless, the court found a violation of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 in the scheme as applied, because, while Indiana health care law generally protected women whose bodily functions would be severely threatened by continued pregnancy (as by diabetes or hypertension) just as it protected those whose lives were threatened, they were not protected in the area of Medicaid coverage.</SPAN></P>

Appellants claimed that the ordinance was void as an ultra vires act and violative of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23. A trial court denied the motion and after an appeal and remand, upheld the ordinance. The court of appeals reversed, finding the ordinance unconstitutional under &sect; 23. The court held that the ordinance did not violate &sect; 23, nor was it void as an ultra vires act exceeding the city's authority. The court held that there was no &sect; 23 violation because the ordinance was uniformly applicable and equally available to all persons similarly situated. Limiting multiple-adult households in single family residential zones to families, and excluding non-families, was reasonably related to the difference between families and non-families. The court further held that, considering the enabling legislation,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-4-201 et seq., and the Home Rule Act, the adoption of the ordinance was not ultra vires.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) sought review of the grant of summary judgment by the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) in favor of appellee developer. The trial court held, among other things, that Indiana state environmental laws gave the IDEM no National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulatory authority over private ponds or isolated wetlands that were not waters of the United States.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer sought to undertake a project that would put dredged and fill material in certain wetlands and waters on a particular site where the developer planned to construct a residential development on approximately 460 acres of property it owned. Approximately 21.52 acres of the property consisted of ponds and wetlands. Of those 21.52 acres, 14.75 of them were wetlands and private ponds that were not subject to the Clean Water Act (CWA). The material was a &quot;pollutant&quot; as the term was used in the CWA and Indiana environmental regulations. The appellate court held the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action. The IDEM was within its statutory authority to require NPDES permits for the discharge of fill material into waters of the state. The IDEM could regulate private ponds when the discharges from the ponds caused or threatened to cause water pollution. Some isolated wetlands were waters of the state.</SPAN></P>

The matter was remanded to the trial court with directions to enter a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

The legislature had determined that the registry information of all sex offenders, currently dangerous or not, had to be publicly disclosed. Any harsh consequences arising out of the registration laws were a matter for the legislature. The same reasoning was applied to the offender's privacy argument under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 1.

The court granted transfer after the Court of Appeals (Indiana) affirmed the punitive damages award, finding that it did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was 17 years old. As a result of the accident, he pleaded guilty to criminal charges and was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. The trial court awarded plaintiffs $ 500,000 in punitive damages in addition to $ 1.4 million in compensatory damages. The driver argued that the punitive damages award was excessive, and the court agreed. The standard of review to be applied in Indiana on a state law challenge to punitive damages was de novo review, just as it would be if a federal due process challenge was made. The factors involved in evaluating a federal constitutional challenge to a punitive award were the same as were relevant to a state law review, so that for consistency, the same standard of review was proper. Applying de novo review to the punitive damages award against the driver, it was clearly excessive. The driver's financial position was a factor to be considered in awarding punitive damages. The driver could never hope to pay the punitive damages award, which was &quot;staggering.&quot; While such damages were meant to deter and punish, the award against the driver passed the point of deterrence and punishment long before it reached the $ 500,000 mark.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment against the driver insofar as it awarded compensatory damages. The court vacated the award of punitive damages and remanded the case to the trial court for entry of a punitive damages award in an amount reflecting proper consideration of the driver's financial status.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court granted transfer to address the availability of the public standing doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandamus to require respondent state transportation agency to enforce a statute against respondent railroad and any other railroad violating a statute that required railroads to maintain public crossings under their control in such a manner as to allow motorists to have an unobstructed view for a certain distance. The trial court denied his petition for writ of mandamus. After petitioner appealed, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling. It found that petitioner lacked standing to bring the action because he did not have a personal stake in the outcome and could not show that he had suffered, or was in immediate danger of suffering, a direct injury as a result of the conduct violating the statute. The state supreme court granted transfer to acknowledge the availability of the public standing doctrine. It then found that petitioner's claim involved the enforcement of a public right, and thus the claim was cognizable under the public standing doctrine. However, the state supreme court affirmed the trial court's denial of the request for the writ of mandamus because amendment of the statute had made the controversy moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant husband distributed at least 60 copies of explicit photos of plaintiff, his ex-wife. The wife sued, alleging invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. A jury awarded her both compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court entered judgment. Both parties appealed. The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed. The State intervened, and its petition for rehearing was denied. Its petition to transfer was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband's arguments were not preserved for appeal, leaving only the wife's challenges to the constitutionality of the punitive damages allocation statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 34-51-3-6 (1998). Under that statute, a punitive damage award was paid to the clerk of court, who then distributed 25 percent to the party to whom the damages were awarded and 75 percent to the state treasurer. The highest appellate court found that civil plaintiffs had no absolute right to receive punitive damages, as they were a creature of the common law. The Indiana Legislature was free to create, modify, or abolish common law causes of action. Although the State paid no part of the attorney's fee, there was no State demand for the attorney's services. The attorney was not required to represent his client in the instant action if the attorney did not want to. No attorney could be compelled to pursue a punitive damage claim. There was no unconstitutional taking of 75 percent of the wife's punitive damages award because a lawyer and a client took the hand that the legislature dealt them, no more and no less. The statute did not require the attorney to provide services to the State without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to suppress his confession. The motion was denied. A jury found him guilty of all counts. The Johnson Circuit Court (Indiana) sentenced defendant to life without parole for the murders, and two consecutive 18-year sentences for the counts of burglary and arson. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court should have suppressed his confession because it was the product of a warrantless arrest without probable cause. The appellate court found no error, since the arresting officers had probable cause to believe that defendant committed the crimes. Defendant also asserted that the delay between his arrest and the probable cause hearing violated his constitutional rights. The State acknowledged that the detention for 63 hours prior to a probable cause hearing was unreasonable. The appellate court found, however, that defendant's confession did not occur until after he saw the magistrate. Thus, defendant's confession was not the product of the delay and was properly suppressed. Finally, defendant contended that his confession should have been suppressed because the court did not appoint counsel for him during the probable cause hearing or when he confessed, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendant did not contend he suffered any damage; thus, denial of the request to suppress was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee widow sued appellant asbestos sellers, claiming that her husband's death was caused by his exposure to asbestos. The Allen Superior Court (Indiana) ruled that Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-2 did not apply to the asbestos sellers, but because it did not, Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1 was unconstitutional. The asbestos sellers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's asbestos exposure occurred over an extended period of time. The asbestos sellers argued that they were not in the limited class to which Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-2 applied, and that the widow was required to proceed under the more restrictive Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1. The widow argued that if Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-2 did not allow her to proceed, then Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1 violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 and Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-2 violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The appellate court ruled that Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-2 only applied if the defendant mined and sold commercial asbestos. Other defendants were entitled to the 10 year statute of repose in Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-32-1. Application of the statute of repose would be constitutional if the first exposure occurred more than 10 years after delivery of the product. The statute might be unconstitutional if the illness could have been diagnosed within the 10 year repose period, but the decedent had no reason to know of the illness until the 10 year period expired. This was to be examined on remand. If there was an Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 defect in Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1, asbestos plaintiffs did not suffer any harm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city-county council vice president filed an action seeking a declaration that a redistricting plan he submitted was valid.

The superior court consolidated the actions and adopted the vice president's plan. Appellants challenged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City-County Council of the City of Indianapolis and Marion County (Indiana) adopted a redistricting plan proposed by the Council's vice president, after a vote along party lines. However, the mayor vetoed that plan. Instead of attempting to override the mayor's veto, the vice president filed an action in superior court, seeking a declaration that his plan was valid. The superior court consolidated that action with an action filed my members of the Council who represented the minority party, and held that the vice president's plan was valid. Sixteen judges of the superior court who voted in favor of the vice president's plan belonged to the same political party as the vice president and other members of the Council who formed the majority party in the Council, and 13 judges of the court who voted against the vice president's plan belonged to the same political party as the mayor and members of the Council who formed the minority party in Council. The state supreme court held that the superior court's ruling had the appearance that it lacked judicial neutrality and, under the circumstances, the supreme court would develop its own redistricting plan for the next election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reversed the superior court's judgment adopting the vice president's redistricting plan, and ordered the use of a redistricting plan the supreme court developed, but also held that its ruling did not preclude the Council and the mayor from agreeing on a different plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer protested because the assessor outsourced a personal property audit to a third party contractor.

The Tax Court rejected a challenge to its subject matter jurisdiction and enjoined the county from proceeding with the audits. On appeal by the county, the assessor, and the Board, the court held that the Tax Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enjoin an audit being pursued by the assessor's contractor. The court held that the taxpayer had established that there was a dispute arising under the tax laws of Indiana, thus meeting the first jurisdictional requirement of Ind. Code &sect; 33-3-5-2(a) (1996). However, there was no final determination by the Board but rather only an advisory opinion. Nor did any of the exceptions to the exhaustion requirement exist. As such, the Tax Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under Ind. Code &sect; 33-3-5-11(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant worker sued appellee insurer, alleging that the insurer was grossly negligent, intentionally inflicted emotional distress, and intentionally deprived the worker of certain statutory rights by refusing to provide worker's compensation benefits and by denying him access to timely medical care and physical therapy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker claimed that the insurer had improperly denied him worker's compensation benefits. The trial court found that, under Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-4-12.1, the Indiana Worker's Compensation Board had exclusive jurisdiction over the claims alleged. The intermediate appellate court held that Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-4-12.1 violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The appellate court ruled that there was no fundamental right to access to the courts. Rather, the legislature had the authority to modify the common law if such change did not interfere with constitutional rights. The legislature could not have unreasonably denied citizens access to the courts, but 4-12.1 Ind. Code &sect; 22-3- 4-12.1(a) merely restricted the remedy for a breach of duty imposed on a worker's compensation carrier.  Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-4-12.1 was part of a special statutory proceeding, and not a &quot;civil case&quot; as contemplated by Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The prohibition against jury trial was reasonable.  Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-4-12.1 violated neither Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 nor Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. Since its classification was reasonable, Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-4-12.1 did not violate Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, either.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners filed a remonstrance and presented a petition in opposition to annexation by defendant city. After dismissal was denied, the city filed a counterclaim, seeking a declaratory judgment that Ind. Code &sect; 36-4-3-13(g) (2002) was unconstitutional special legislation, in violation of Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' petition purportedly contained the signatures of a majority of the property owners in the proposed annexation area. This was all that was required for that particular county, under Ind. Code &sect; 36-4-3-13(g) (2002). Since the statute applied only to counties within a specified population range, the net effect was that the opposition of 65 percent of the affected landowners, to defeat a municipal annexation, was required in 91 of Indiana's 92 counties. A simple majority was sufficient in the other. The highest appellate court found that the circumstances surrounding the enactment of the legislation led to the conclusion that the statute was special legislation. The statute's population classification served no purpose other than to identify the one county. While preserving rural land near urban areas or preventing competing annexations might be legitimate concerns, there was no basis to conclude that they were unique to the one county. Therefore, the legislation was unconstitutional special legislation. The offending part of the statute was the specified population range, set forth in Ind. Code &sect; 36-4-3-13(g) (2002). Since it was not severable, the statute was void.</SPAN></P>

The offenders sought a preliminary injunction with respect to enforcement of the statutes, which the trial court denied. The court of appeals denied the motion to grant an injunction as a stay, pending appeal of the trial court's denial, and the court's consideration of the issues was sought on an expedited basis. The court accepted jurisdiction and entered a stay. The court held that the complex constitutional issues raised by the case involved numerous considerations and the balancing of various interests. Of particular note was the fact that two federal appellate courts had already decided that such Internet publication might have violated the United States Constitution. The publication was set to occur within days and the court had not had sufficient time to consider the merits. Further, the issues raised under the Indiana Constitution had never been addressed. The balance of harm favored the offenders and a stay was entered to maintain the status quo as it existed prior to the enactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a matter of original jurisdiction, petitioner disciplinary commission sought the imposition of sanctions against respondent attorney for statements made in a petition to transfer a case from the court of appeals to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney said a court of appeals opinion left him wondering if the court was determined to find for the adverse party, and said whatever was necessary to reach that conclusion. He was charged with violating Ind. R. Prof. Conduct 8.2(a). The supreme court held while the attorney may not have authored the words, he signed the brief pursuant to Ind. R. Admis. Bar &amp; Disc. Atty's 3(2)(d) and was jointly responsible. The attorney's other statements paraphrased bases for transfer of a case from the court of appeals to the supreme court in Ind. R. App. P. 11(b) (now Ind. R. App. P. 57) and did not violate Ind. R. Prof. Conduct 8.2(a). The statements at issue recklessly disregarded their truth or falsity concerning the integrity of a three-judge panel of the court of appeals, contrary to Rule 8.2(a). The state's interest in preserving the public's confidence in the administration of justice outweighed the attorney's freedom to air these concerns. The statement exceeded the boundaries of acceptable appellate practice. The attorney's remorse was belied by his belief that only a poor choice of words was made, and by his choice to contest the matter through available procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the claim that Ind. R. Evid. 704(b) was violated was not presented at trial or in defendant's pre-trial motion to exclude that was referenced in her trial objection, and thus procedural default applied. Under Ind. R. Evid. 403, police interrogators' accusations and defendant's responses had little probative value in establishing her guilt. The repeated police accusations, in the context of the entire statement, did not create a substantial risk of unfair prejudice. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the redacted exhibits. Regardless of whether each statement was considered individually or whether all the statements were considered collectively, there was no fundamental error. The appellate court declined to infer the existence of a serious evidentiary dispute where the undisputed evidence showed that defendant's actions were done with an awareness of the high probability that they would result in the death of her children. Because of the absence of a jury determination that qualifying aggravating circumstances were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the life sentence was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court denied appellant minor's motion for support and educational orders against appellees, his mother and father, and granted the father's petition to find the minor emancipated under Ind. Code &sect; 31-16-6-6(b)(3). The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed the emancipation ruling and the denial of the support and educational orders and found that the minor waived review of a de facto custodian issue. The state supreme court granted transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor sought the support and educational orders in 1999, alleging that appellees abandoned him. The trial court found that the minor had lived with aunts since 1996, that appellees had provided him with little support since a post-divorce agreed entry in 1998 giving them joint custody of him, and that the minor was emancipated under &sect; 31-16-6-6(b)(3) because he had not been under appellees' care and control. The minor argued on appeal that the trial court erred in finding him emancipated and in failing to join one of his aunts as a de facto custodian under Ind. Code &sect; 31-17-2-8.5 (Supp. 1999), and that appellees should be responsible for his appellate attorney's fees. The state supreme court held that the minor was not emancipated because his financial dependence on his extended family indicated that he was not self-supporting. The minor waived his de facto custodian argument by failing to move, pursuant to Ind. R. Trial P. 19, to join the aunt or to dismiss for lack of an indispensable party. Finally, contrary to the minor's contentions, appellees were not responsible for his appellate attorney's fees under Ind. Code &sect; 34-10-1-2 (1998) or Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 31-15-10-1, 31-16-11-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court summarily affirmed a finding by the court of appeals that the father waived review of a cross-appeal he had filed, reversed the conclusion that the minor was emancipated, denied the minor's request for appellate attorney's fees, affirmed the court of appeals' finding that the minor waived his de facto custodian issue, and remanded the matter to the trial court to determine if support payments for the minor were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that Indiana's bail scheme was not unconstitutional. The unequal treatment accorded bail agents and defendants posting 10 percent cash bonds was rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in ensuring the appearance of defendants at judicial proceedings and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The scheme did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The scheme created different classes, because without the threat of late surrender fees, bail agents had no incentive to ensure a defendant's appearance, as they got to keep the entire premium, regardless of whether the defendant appeared. Any disparate treatment between bail agents and defendants who posted 10 percent cash bonds was reasonably related to the inherent characteristics between the two unequally treated classes.

The high court upheld the trial court's denial of his petition, on most issues for failure to show prejudice from alleged incidences of failure to disclose exculpatory evidence or counsel ineffectiveness at trial, during the penalty phase, or on appeal. The high court particularly found that counsel exercised reasonable judgment in determining to focus on one factor in mitigation at the penalty phase. The high court also found that Indiana's death penalty statute did not violate the rule of Apprendi in permitting the trial court to impose the death penalty despite a contrary recommendation, because the rule expressly excluded state death penalty statutes and because a death penalty was the permissible statutory maximum sentence for murder. Finally, the post-conviction judge's brief, casual conversation with an old friend was not grounds for disqualification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff students brought an action against defendant school claiming that the school's policy of administering random drug tests to certain students violated the Search and Seizure Clause, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;23. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the school. The Howard Circuit Court (Indiana) reversed. The school appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students argued that the random drug testing program violated their rights under the Indiana Constitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The supreme court concluded that the drug-testing program was constitutional. The supreme court noted that the policy did not require testing for students in compulsory regular classes, but rather for those involved in voluntary activities for which they receive academic credit. The court held that the refusal to agree to drug testing which might result in forfeiture of the opportunity was not so weighty as to constitute forced consent in violation of the students' rights. As to the privileges and immunities claim, the supreme court found that the students did not carry their burden to negative every reasonable basis for random drug testing imposed upon the students. Thus, there was no violation of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. Therefore, the supreme court held that testing those students who were at an increased risk of physical harm or were role models and leaders was reasonably related to achieving the school's purpose in providing for the health and safety of students.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that cocaine found in an unconstitutional search of the safe deposit box by criminal authorities could be used by revenue authorities to make a tax assessment. While the exclusionary rule barred the use of the cocaine as evidence in criminal proceedings, the exclusionary rule did not apply to tax assessment proceedings. There was no evidence in the record that suggested that revenue officers were involved in the search of the safe deposit box, which was the only search at issue. The costs of applying the exclusionary rule to Ind. Code &sect; 6-7-3-13 (1998) outweighed its limited benefits in this context, and the court declined to apply the rule to the evidence seized from the safe deposit box. As to the costs, the court believed that application of the exclusionary rule in Ind. Code &sect; 6-7-3-13 (1998) proceedings would undermine several important state interests. The police would not be significantly deterred by the prospect of the exclusion of evidence in Ind. Code &sect; 6-7-3-13 (1998) proceedings because their primary concern was criminal prosecutions, where the exclusionary rule already applied.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-48-4-1 (1998), and possession of cocaine, in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-6 (1998).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police previously found cocaine in a safety deposit box leased by defendant, resulting in criminal charges. The charges were dropped after a trial court suppressed the cocaine for the purposes of the pending criminal charges. A day before the charges were dropped, the revenue department issued an assessment on the drugs seized from the safety deposit box, pursuant to the Controlled Substance Excise Tax, Ind. Code &sect; 6-7-3-1 et seq. A jeopardy tax warrant was issued, and defendant's home was searched. All of the cocaine, upon which the charges in the instant case were based, was found before the police served a valid search warrant. In finding the search unreasonable, and in ordering the suppression of the cocaine, the highest appellate court found that a tax seizure could be effected without judicial intervention if the property to be seized was found in a public place. But, if it was necessary to enter private premises to effect the seizure, the government had to first obtain a court order authorizing such entry. There were no exigent circumstances, such as an attempt to abscond, hide assets, or destroy documents, which would have justified the warrantless search.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a decree and divided the marital property.

The appellate court held that as a matter of statutory construction, Ind. Code &sect; 34-10-1-2 required appointment of counsel and conferred no discretion on the trial court to deny counsel if its terms were met. The decision to appoint counsel in a civil case turned on the court's assessment of the nature of the case, the genuineness of the issues, and any other factors that bore on the wisdom of mandating public funds for that purpose. The procedure for the trial court follow was: (1) the litigant was to apply for leave to proceed as an indigent person, and (2) if the trial court found that the applicant was indigent and without sufficient means to prosecute or defend the action, the trial court was required to appoint counsel. Courts had the inherent power to appoint and require payment of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Wayne Superior Court (Indiana) found defendant guilty of murder, and the trial court sentenced him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court failed to provide a specific statement regarding the need for correctional or rehabilitative treatment and that the court improperly considered four apprehensions that did not result in convictions. The trial court set out defendant's long history of encounters with the law, and noted various types of care and rehabilitation provided to defendant, all of which were unsuccessful. The appellate court found that the trial judge did a commendable job of explaining why an enhanced sentence was necessary. Arrests not reduced to conviction could properly be considered in sentencing as evidence that defendant's antisocial behavior had not been deterred after having been subject to the police authority, and the trial court properly considered such arrests. The trial court's consideration of defendant's prior arrests, analyzed in the way it did, and placed alongside a substantial list of convictions, was not a denial of due process. The trial court's refusal to give significant weight to defendant's age as a mitigating factor did not produce a sentence that was manifestly unreasonable. The trial court applied the correct presumptive sentencing term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Personal representatives of a deceased worker's estate (the estate) sought to recover damages claiming that the decedent was exposed to asbestos during the course of 40 years. The original complaint listed 33 manufacturers or distributors of asbestos, some of which settled claims. An asbestos manufacturer filed an answer which included the affirmative defense that other parties were responsible, and moved for summary judgment for lack of product identification. The trial court denied the motion, and after a trial, a jury awarded damages to the estate. Due to inadequate discovery responses, the trial court granted the estate's motion for summary judgment on the issue of other parties' liability. The intermediate court reversed, and found that the trial court should have granted the manufacturer's motion for summary judgment. The appellate court found that the estate's evidence was sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the manufacturer's asbestos caused his injuries. However, the appellate court found that the trial court erred in refusing to allow the manufacturer to bring the issue of other parties' liability to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1993, a municipality and various taxpayers challenged Indiana's real property assessment procedure, asserting that it did not provide a uniform and equal rate of property assessment and taxation pursuant to Ind. Const. art. X, &sect; 1(a). Seven decisions later (two by the Supreme Court of Indiana and five by the Indiana Tax Court), the tax court ordered the Indiana State Board of Tax Commissioners to adopt new, constitutional regulations. In this action by taxpayers to recover the costs of attorneys' fees they incurred in pursuing that litigation, the tax court adopted the private attorney general exception to the American rule on payment of attorneys' fees and granted the taxpayers' request. However, the state supreme court reversed. In its opinion, the supreme court noted that the states are divided on this issue and, in Indiana, the legislature had enacted Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 36-52-2-2, -3 (2001) and other statutes that provide for fee-shifting in actions involving the state or particular areas of the law. Accordingly, the supreme court refused to adopt the private attorney general exception judicially.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress because the search and seizure did not violate his constitutional rights. The traffic stop was valid, defendant's 100-minute detention, during which a search warrant was procured, was reasonable, and the warrant was supported by probable cause, given the drugs and weapons found on the passenger and in the vehicle. Because defendant was listed as an additional driver on the vehicle's rental agreement and was the actual driver when it was stopped, the evidence was sufficient to show that he possessed the drugs.</SPAN></P>

An interlocutory order of the St. Joseph Circuit Court (Indiana) overruled appellant's objections to the proceedings. Appellant requested review. Appellant requested an evidentiary hearing whether the taking violated Ind. Const. art. I and U.S. Const. amend. I protections of free exercise of religious worship and assembly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court concluded that Indiana eminent domain laws, under which appellee sought to take appellant's property, were religious-neutral laws of general applicability so that the city was not required to demonstrate a compelling government interest. The supreme court rejected the contention that Ind. Const. art. I was to be equated with U.S. Const. amend. I. Ind. Const. art. I protected more than just the personal devotional aspect of religion; it also protected the private and communal practice of religion. Exercise of the police power of condemnation impinged upon that core value protected by Ind. Const. art. I. The appellant had the right to contest the proceedings under Ind. Code &sect; 32-11-1-5. The supreme court ordered a hearing to determine whether appellant could carry its substantial burden to prove the condemnation materially burdened the core values of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 3, 4. The supreme court, after analysis, in a split decision, denied a hearing with respect to U.S. Const. amend. I. The hybrid claim Smith exception to the exercise of a neutral state law did not apply as the right to assemble was a derivative right of the free exercise of religion right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was renovating her home, a county building inspector ordered defendant to stop the project because the renovations failed to meet code.

Defendant appealed the trial court's decision to the court of appeals, which reversed and dissolved the temporary restraining order. On remand, defendant asserted that she was entitled to damages under Ind. R. Trial P. 65(C). The trial court denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, but certified the order for interlocutory appeal. The court of appeals held that Ind. R. Trial P. 65 was procedural in nature and therefore trumped the conflicting provisions of the Indiana Tort Claims Act, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 34-13-3-1 to 34-13-3-25 (1998), under which plaintiffs claimed immunity. The instant court granted transfer. The instant court found that defendant's counterclaim sought damages solely on the basis of the dissolution of the restraining order after her initial appeal, and there was no showing bad faith in the record. As such, the trial court should have granted plaintiff county's motion for summary judgment as to defendant's damage claims.</SPAN></P>

The comments did not reflect personal bias or prejudice against the defendant such that the judge should have disqualified himself. Additionally, although the jury instruction on the presumption of innocence was misleading, the court found that the outcome of the trial was not likely to be different without this instruction, as the evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming.

Code &sect; 34-13-5-7(c), (e). Appellants did not post bond and appealed claiming the trial court erred in ordering them to post bond because they had raised two substantial questions for trial. The appellate court disagreed and found that because appellants offered no justification for their claim that the council overstepped its statutory authority, they raised no substantial question of improper delegation: nor was it improper for the council to defer the final resolution vote to a later date or for the mayor to call a special meeting for a vote. The appellate court also found that the evidence supported the challenged findings; therefore, the trial court's order to post bail was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; the challenged findings were supported by the evidence and appellants raised no substantial questions for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found appellant guilty of four counts of murder. The trial court ordered the death sentence, upon the jury's recommendation. On appeal, the court considered appellant's eight claims, including that the state death penalty statute was unconstitutional, ambiguous, and violated his right to a jury trial. Additionally, he argued that the prosecutor committed misconduct in his closing argument, that the judge improperly considered a non-statutory aggravator when sentencing, and the death penalty was manifestly unreasonable in his case. The appeals court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the death sentence, reasoning that there was a significant possibility that the trial court may have relied upon non-statutory aggravating factors in deciding whether to impose the death penalty, when the judge considered future dangerousness, which was not one of the enumerated aggravating circumstances permitted under the Indiana death penalty statute.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 35-33.5-1-1 through 35-33.5-5-6, was unconstitutionally vague because it did not clearly define the conduct prohibited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged for allegedly secretly tape recording his estranged wife's telephone conversations. The trial court dismissed the charge on the ground that the Indiana Wiretap Act (Act) was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that even though the Act was internally inconsistent regarding the degree of culpability required, a person of ordinary intelligence would know that the act of wiring a tape recorder to secretly record another's conversation was an intentional act clearly prohibited by the Act. The court held that the phrase &quot;under this article&quot; contained in Ind. Code &sect; 35-33.5-1-5 limited the definition of &quot;interception&quot; to an application under the Act, and did not mean that the Act only outlawed interceptions by a computer or fax machine. The court held that the Act did not incorporate conflicting federal case law on intercepting the telephone communications of one's spouse within the marital home, but that rather the provision, Ind. Code &sect; 35-33.5-5-5(a), provided an exemption for any wiretapping conducted by law enforcement under the Federal Wiretap Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed because the Indiana Wiretap Act (Act) was not unconstitutionally vague as it clearly prohibited the act of wiring a tape recorder to secretly record another's conversation, the Act did not outlaw only those interceptions accomplished by a computer or fax machine, and did not incorporate conflicting federal case law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant shot his wife, her stepfather, and another man in her company after appellant discovered his wife kissing this man. Appellant's wife died from her six gunshot wounds. The two men survived. The trial court imposed consecutive sentences of 65 years for murder and 50 years for each attempted murder. It also ordered a concurrent 20 sentence for burglary. Appellant asserted the trial court erred when it refused his tendered instructions on criminal recklessness and reckless homicide. The court disagreed. Appellant's mere assertion of an involuntary intoxication defense did not create a serious evidentiary dispute such that a jury could have concluded appellant did not commit murder, but instead committed the lesser included offense of reckless homicide. Trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on criminal recklessness because it was neither inherently nor factually included in the crime charged. Trial court erred when it ordered appellant's sentences for the two counts of attempted murder to be served consecutively for a total term of 100 years. This portion of the sentence exceeded the statutory limitation. Thus, the case was remanded for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions were affirmed, as trial court did not err by refusing to instruct the jury on reckless homicide and criminal recklessness as lesser included offenses of murder and attempted murder, respectively.

It was part of the farm credit system, a network of cooperative, borrower-owned banks established to provide affordable credit to farmers and ranchers. As an ACA, appellee claimed it was exempt from Indiana's Financial Institutions Tax under constitutional principles of intergovernmental tax immunity. The court reversed. As a merged association, appellee was a combination of the two previous entities. The resulting ACA continued to provide the same services. Appellee performed two autonomous functions: long-term mortgage lending through an FLBA and short-term lending through a PCA. Congress found long-term lending institutions, like FLBA's, were entitled to immunity while short-term lending institutions, like PCA's which were privately owned and controlled, were not entitled to immunity. Thus, appellant was entitled to tax only income derived from appellee's short-term PCA operations.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the conviction, arguing the trial court improperly instructed the jury on plaintiff State's burden of proof and statutory intoxication defense, that the trial court improperly admitted several photographs of victim into evidence, and other errors. The court held the reasonable doubt jury instruction given was proper. The instructions informed jurors that if they concluded beyond reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty, they should have returned verdict of guilty. The court held it was not improper to instruct the jury with regards to the word &quot;should&quot;. The court held the evidence did not demonstrate that defendant was so intoxicated at the time of the crime as to prevent him from forming the requisite intent to murder. Several days after the murder, defendant gave police a comprehensive account of his activities. Defendant was alert enough to walk home, climb through a window, and wash blood from his hands and face. The court held the trial court properly admitted photographs of the victim. The photographs at issue established the cause of death and the manner in which the crime was committed.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court reversed, and held that the statute of limitations within the Act was unconstitutional as it applied to appellee. Appellant sought further review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a petition to transfer, appealing the judgment of the Indiana Court of Appeals, which affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment for defendant manufacturer, in a suit to determine whether the 10-year statute of repose, Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1(b), violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 12, 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendants for injuries allegedly caused by a defect in a product manufactured by defendant manufacturer, which plaintiffs had purchased 13 years earlier. The state trial court granted defendant manufacturer's summary judgment motion based on the 10-year statute of repose, Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1(b). The state appellate court affirmed the decision. Plaintiffs filed a petition to transfer, arguing that the statute violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 12, 23. The state supreme court granted plaintiffs' transfer petition, and held that the statute was constitutional. First, the legislature had made the permissible legislative choice to limit product liability actions to the first 10 years of a product's use; thus, plaintiffs' injuries were not legally cognizable injuries for which a remedy existed. Second, the statute's disparate treatment was reasonably related to the class' inherent characteristics and did not distinguish among class members. Therefore, the grant of defendant manufacturer's motion was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of defendant manufacturer's summary judgment motion was affirmed, on grounds that the statute of repose was constitutional. The legislature's choice to limit product liability actions to the first 10 years of a product's use was permissible, and the statute's disparate treatment was reasonably related to the class' inherent characteristics.</SPAN></P>

As to the placing of the chain across the street, the court held that plaintiff failed to present evidence that such action deprived her of access to her property or inconvenienced her more greatly than the general public, such that the action was not a taking of property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences for two choking and stabbing murders. He presented two claims of error: (1) that the accomplice liability statute, as applied, violated the privileges and immunities clause of the Indiana Constitution; and (2) that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences without finding an aggravating circumstance. As to the first claim, the court found that current state law superceded the common law of criminal liability and thus the legal distinction between a principal and an accessory had ceased to exist. The court held that the first claim failed under the Collins test, so the statute, as applied, did not violate the privileges and immunities clause of the Indiana Constitution. Regarding the second claim, the court found that the trial court did not properly articulate the requirement to evaluate any aggravating circumstances used to impose consecutive sentences, but that the consecutive sentences were appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because accomplice liability statute did not violate the privileges and immunities clause of the Indiana Constitution, and, even though trial court's articulation fell short of the requirement that it evaluate any aggravating circumstances used to impose consecutive sentences, the court found consecutive sentences warranted.</SPAN></P>

When the complaint was filed, plaintiff was in remission. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants, holding plaintiff wife suffered no present compensable injury, and the appellate court affirmed. The court held plaintiff could maintain a cause of action for increased risk of harm, described as decreased life expectancy or diminished probability of long-term survival. Plaintiff's medical experts testified the cancer would be incurable if plaintiff relapsed. The experts testified plaintiff's chances of complete recovery dropped significantly from the time of initial discovery to the date of diagnosis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of dealing in cocaine, possession of cocaine, dealing in marijuana, and possession of marijuana. The trial court enhanced defendant's sentence by 30 years based upon a habitual offender finding.

The court held the trial court improperly considered two aggravating factors in enhancing the sentence. However, the court held the sentence was not based solely on those to factors. The trial court found six aggravating factors. The court held a single aggravating factor was sufficient to support the sentence enhancement. The court held the exclusion of jurors by plaintiff was proper. The court found age was a legitimate reason for the exercise of peremptory challenges in narcotics cases. The court held age was not a suspect classification with respect to the exercise of peremptory challenges.</SPAN></P>

A Kastigar hearing was not necessary. Defendant gave two statements to the police. Neither of these statements was subject to his grant of immunity.

Victim pursued appellant, and reached into the open window of appellant's getaway car to turn off the ignition. Appellant rapped his knuckles with a screwdriver and drove down the alley, but victim hung onto the car. Victim eventually fell off and appellant ran over his leg as he sped away. The snatching of money, exertion of force, and escape were so closely connected in time, place, and continuity that appellant's taking of property included the force used in his escape; thus, it was a robbery. Victim, a 69-year-old man, suffered a fractured ankle and badly lacerated arms and legs.
