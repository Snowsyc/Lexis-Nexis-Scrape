</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sued respondent, alleging that a sanitation permit fee imposed on their townhouse development project was an taking in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V. The District Court of Summit County (Colorado) denied the claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Petitioners sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, developers of a townhouse project, sued respondent sanitation district, contending that respondent's &quot;plant investment fee&quot; (PIF) assessment for their project was an unconstitutional taking. The trial court held that the constitutional takings analysis was inapplicable, and that even if it were, respondent satisfied the test because the PIF was roughly proportional to the impact of the project on the district facilities. The court of appeals affirmed, and the supreme court granted certiorari review. The supreme court also affirmed, holding that the PIF was a valid, legislatively established fee that was reasonably related to respondent district's interest in expanding its infrastructure to account for new development, and that respondent's specific PIF assessment on petitioners' project was fairly calculated and rationally based. As such, the PIF did not fall into the narrow category of charges that were subject to a Nollan/Dolan takings analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgments of the court of appeals and trial court affirmed. The plant investment fee was not imposed adjudicatively in the Nollan/Dolan sense, and was not an assessment unique to petitioners. The fee was neither a land use regulation nor an exaction of property as a condition of development. Consequently, it was not subject to a constitutional takings analysis.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 10.5-1 to 10.5-41, which required appellees to obtain a private use permit before occupying or using its public rights-of-way. Appellees sued for declaratory, injunctive, and other relief, claiming the ordinance was inconsistent with and preempted by S. 96-10, 1996 Colo. Sess. Laws 298, codified at Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 38-5.5-101 to -108, which granted appellees a right to occupy public rights-of-way without additional authorization or franchise from local municipalities. Appellant counterclaimed for inverse condemnation. The district court found the ordinance invalid, granted appellees judgment on the pleadings, and dismissed the counterclaim. Appellant sought review from the state supreme court, which affirmed. Because key provisions of the ordinance conflicted with S. 96-10 on a matter of mixed state and local concern and S. 96-10 was not unconstitutional or invalid, it was not error to find the ordinance invalid. Because S. 96-10 did not authorize the taking of private property from appellant, it was not error to dismiss the counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two actions, respondents, a county assessment appeal board and the State Board of Equalization, ordered possessory interests in government-owned land removed from the tax rolls under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-3-136. Petitioners, county officials, appealed. The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the orders, holding the legislation was a constitutionally permissible exercise of legislative authority. On certiorari, the cases were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-3-136 created a property tax exemption for ski areas and other parties with long-term leases, permits, or contracts to use federal property. However, the state supreme court held the statute violated the state constitution, which prohibited statutory exemptions to property taxation unless the exemptions were authorized in Colo. Const. art. X. Only non-producing unpatented mining claims were exempt under art. X &sect; 3(1)(b). Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-3-136(1) defined a class of property known as &quot;possessory interests&quot;; (2) prohibited taxation of a subclass of that property while continuing taxation of other possessory interests; and (3) carved out certain interests within the subclass for continued taxation. Since uniform taxation of similar interests was required, the disparate tax treatment was only permissible if the property was also exempted in the constitution, which it was not. Respondent resort company's possessory interests in federal property and improvements thereon for its ski area constituted real property, that qualified as &quot;taxable property&quot; under &sect; 39-1-102.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the unconstitutional portions of the statute severed. The judgments in both cases were reversed, and the cases were remanded to the state and county boards for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of second degree assault, possession of more than eight ounces of marijuana, and misdemeanor menacing. The Colorado Court of Appeals, finding prejudicial error in the assault conviction, reversed that conviction and remanded for a new trial. The State sought a writ of certiorari, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot his wife through a bedroom wall, while intoxicated. In the emergency room, a female physician assistant attended the victim. The investigating officer asked her to photograph the wounds, because they were in the groin area. Defendant moved to suppress the photographs from evidence on the basis of physician-patient privilege. The trial court ruled that because the photographs were not necessary for treatment, they did not fall within the privilege, and allowed the physician assistant to provide foundation testimony for them. It also concluded the evidence was relevant to whether the assault caused serious bodily injury, one of the elements of second degree assault under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-203(1)(d) (2000). Defendant was convicted of second degree assault and other charges. The court of appeals reversed the assault conviction, based on prejudicial error. The supreme court reversed, holding that a photograph of a victim's injury taken by a physician assistant at the request of an investigating police officer did fall under the physician-patient privilege, but was admissible by operation of the reporting statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-36-135 (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellate judgment was reversed, as physician-patient privilege was abrogated by reporting statute, because incident involved gunshot wounds and privileged photographs were obtained through physician assistant's observation of those wounds. So the trial court did not err in admitting the photographs, even though information in them fell within the physician-patient privilege.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile appealed the decision of the trial court not to order a jury trial. The lower court upheld the decision. Defendant alleged this denial violated Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2-107 and both the United States Constitution and Colorado Constitution. He also argued that &sect; 19-2-107 was unconstitutional. The judgment of the lower court was affirmed. The juvenile justice system and the adult criminal system were different with different goals. Section 19-2-107 listed the crimes which required that a juvenile be given a jury trial. If the crime was not listed, the trial court had discretion whether to have a jury trial. This was not an abuse of discretion and did not violate a juvenile's constitutional rights since caselaw had determined that a jury trial in a juvenile proceeding was not a constitutional requirement. There was no equal protection violation, because each juvenile received similar treatment under the law. Therefore, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2-107 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The trial court had discretion in juvenile proceedings to decide whether to order a jury trial if the defendant had not been charged with crimes listed in the statute. The exercise of this discretion was not an equal protection or a due process violation. The juvenile justice system was different that the adult criminal system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted as a complicator to a number of offenses arising out of the assault, rape, kidnapping, and murder of a 14-year-old girl. Following defendant's conviction by a jury, because the case was tried as a death penalty case, a three-judge panel conducted the sentencing phase of the case pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-103. Two of the judges found the death penalty appropriate. The third judge dissented. Under the statute, because the panel was not unanimous, the death penalty could not be imposed. The State appealed the dissenting opinion to the Colorado Supreme Court. The appellate court found that the dissenting judge listed two reasons for his dissent: one legal and one factual. Because one of the judge's reasons was factual, even under a different application of the law, he would have reached the same conclusion as to the death penalty. Therefore, the appellate court found that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-12-102(1), and declined to exercise original jurisdiction under Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Colorado Secretary of State determined that an insufficient number of valid signatures supported a proposed citizen-initiated measure in order to place the measure on the Colorado election ballot. Despite having previously affirmed the decision of appellant secretary, the district court granted a motion to vacate the court's earlier judgment, and ordered appellant secretary to reexamine the petitions gathered by non-registered circulators. Appellants, the secretary and a citizen advocate, challenged the order on direct appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court arguing that the district court erred in applying a later decision by the United States Supreme Court in Buckley. The instant court found that a later change in decisional law after a judgment became final was not, in itself, justification for reopening that judgment. Further, the instant court found that the trial court erred in considering itself obligated to apply the Buckley decision to the case at hand. As such, the judgment of the district court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with driving under restraint in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 42-2-138.

Plaintiff State appealed, and the appellate court affirmed. Plaintiff appealed again, claiming that the statute was not unconstitutional because driving under restraint was a public welfare offense, rather than a traditional crime, negating the traditional knowledge requirement. The court reversed and remanded, holding that Colo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 42-2-138 was not unconstitutional because it punished those who had actual knowledge of facts that would have led a reasonable person to believe that his license was under restraint, it contained additional notice safeguards to provide the driver with actual notice, there was a strong public safety interest in regulating drivers and driving, and its violation was a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner planning commission denied the requested change, as did petitioner city commission. Respondent then appealed pursuant to Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4). The district court denied the requested relief, but the appellate court reversed stating that a service center was explicitly permitted in a PBC. By a writ of certiorari, the state supreme court agreed to hear petitioners' appeal and reversed the appellate court stating that although the service center was a permitted use, Colorado Springs, Colo., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 4-6-602(C) listed the applicable criteria and gave petitioners discretion to authorize or deny specific uses within a PBC.</SPAN></P>

The trial court conducted an erroneous legal analysis to evaluate defense counsel's motion under &sect;&sect; 16-8-103(2), 16-8-103.5(2). Specifically, the trial court adopted the common law approach that examined whether the defendant voluntarily and intelligently waived her right to assert the mental status defenses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners assessed respondent certain sales and use taxes. Respondent subsequently sued in the trial court, seeking a refund of the taxes. Petitioners moved to dismiss, arguing that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the case because respondent failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.

However, on further review, the court reversed and remanded for dismissal of the action, finding that respondent had failed to exhaust its available administrative remedies. Accordingly, it was found that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the case. The court held that when an agency directed a party to follow certain administrative procedures consistent with the agency's governing statutes or ordinances, the party had to exhaust those procedures or demonstrate that an exception from the exhaustion requirement excused their failure to do so before the party could have sought judicial review of the agency's decision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On transfer from court of appeals, appellant city appealed order of Arapahoe County District Court, (Colorado), which ruled that appellant's annexation proceedings be held in abeyance pending proposed city incorporation election, and that the 1999 amendment to state Municipal Annexation Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-12-118, unconstitutionally impaired pre-annexation agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant home rule city filed petitions with its clerk to annex unincorporated areas. Subsequently, appellees petitioned the district court for incorporation of a new city pursuant to the Municipal Annexation Act of 1965 (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-12-101 et seq. Both annexation and incorporation proposals required voter approval, however, if voters first approved annexations, the new city could not be established. Following hearings on cross-motions for dismissal, the district court ruled that the incorporation election was to precede the annexation elections, but that the Act's 1999 amendment was unconstitutional. Upon the appellate court's request under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4-110(1)(a), the court affirmed in part, holding that although appellant's interest under Colo. Const. art. XX conferred standing upon appellant, annexation proceedings were held in abeyance under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-12-118; reversed in part, holding that the 1999 Act was constitutional because it neither was special nor retrospective legislation, nor did it impair pre-annexation agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Faced with a shortage of available housing for its working citizens, petitioner Town of Telluride (town), a home rule municipality under Colo. Const. art. XX, passed a comprehensive ordinance that required developers of projects such as malls and hotels to generate affordable housing for 40 percent of the new employees created by development. Respondent developer challenged the ordinance as violating Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-12-301 (1999) which banned local rent control legislation. The Colorado Court of Appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of town. On certiorari, the Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed the appellate court's judgment invalidating the ordinance because it not only fell clearly within the plain meaning, but it also conflicted with the statute. The Supreme Court further held that the statute superceded the authority of a home rule municipality because rent control was an issue implicating mixed state and local concerns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of fourth degree arson under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-105 (1999). The court granted certiorari and determined that the mens rea requirement did not apply to the phrase &quot;and by so doing places another in danger of death or serious bodily injury.&quot; Appellant's argument that the legislature intended to apply the mens rea requirement to the statute's endangerment provisions was rejected. The amendment enunciated the culpability requirement for the conduct portion of the statute, while continuing to hold defendant criminally responsible for the endangerment of persons and property. Appellant knowingly set a car on fire and responding firefighters were subsequently endangered. This was sufficient to support the endangerment element. Jury was concerned with a legal question, the answer to which was not readily apparent in the original instructions. Judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A reorganization leading to creation of a lab school at a juvenile facility included transferring facility teachers to other positions in petitioner Department of Human Services (DHS) or to positions exempt from the state personnel system. Respondent teachers sued petitioner agencies, contending the transfers and authorizing agreement violated the Civil Service Amendment to the state constitution and state statutes. Although an administrative law judge upheld the agreement and the transfers, the court of appeals reversed. The court granted certiorari to address whether the transfers violated existing law and whether DHS had statutory authority to execute the contract with the college to run the school. It reversed, holding the agreement and exemption of lab school positions from the state personnel system were constitutional, because the instructors were college employees exempt from the personnel system. It concluded respondent teachers were not improperly transferred, as they retained full pay, status, and tenure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant credit union, on certiorari granted by the Supreme Court of Colorado, challenged the decision by the Colorado Court of Appeals, affirming the probate court's dismissal of appellants' claim against appellee estate of deceased.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court interpreted Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-12-803(1)(a)(III) as a nonclaim statute requiring all creditors to present claims against an estate within one year of the decedent's death. Finding appellant had failed to present its claim against the estate within one year, the court had dismissed appellant's claim as time-barred. After the court of appeals affirmed that decision, this appeal followed. Judgment was affirmed, the general assembly had determined that a one year period for presenting claims was necessary to promote the speedy and efficient settlement of estates, and a statute of limitations did not deprive a claimant of its rights to due process unless the time for bringing the claim was so limited as to amount to a denial of justice. It could not conclude that the one year period for bringing a claim against an estate was so limited as to amount to a denial of justice.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was not deprived of its right to due process by application of the statutory one year limitation to file its claim against appellee estate, rejecting appellant's argument that the estate's personal representative's conduct tolled the one year period for presenting claims against the estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Voters approved an amendment to respondent city's charter providing for collective bargaining between petitioner police union and respondent, and for a system of binding arbitration to resolve impasses in negotiations. Respondent sought declaratory judgment on the validity of the arbitration provisions. The district court ruled that the provisions violated Colo. Const. art. XXI, &sect; 4. Petitioner appealed. The court granted certiorari before judgment in the appeals court pursuant to Colo. App. R. 50 to review the district court's order declaring the arbitration provisions unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded the district court's judgment because the court concluded that the provisions provided the arbitrator with political accountability in compliance with the Colorado constitution. The court reasoned that the arbitrator was directly politically accountable to the elective officials comprising respondent city council because any arbitrator selected to hear a case first would have been appointed to the permanent panel by respondent city council. Respondent city council, therefore, had exclusive control over which arbitrators may hear a case.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-4-103(5)(f) (2014); [2]-The bond condition did not violate his constitutional right to parent his children because, in part, the order did not prevent him from having contact with his children or participating in decisions regarding their welfare.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-204(1), was not unconstitutionally vague on its face. Under the doctrine of ejusdem generis, the phrase was limited to containers with the same characteristics as the other items listed in the statute. Specifically, it covered only containers that are designed and used for the safekeeping of money or valuables, where that design and use was evidence; [2]-The gym lockers were secured with personal combination locks and thus, they bore readily ascertainable features to suggest that they were being employed for the safekeeping of money or valuables in the same manner as those items enumerated in the statute.</SPAN></P>

XIV were not violated because the identity theft statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-5-902, targeted acts having graver consequences than the acts proscribed by the unauthorized use of a financial transaction device statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(4)(a), violated the Eight Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment; [2]-As Miller did not prohibit imposing LWOP sentences on juveniles, but required that the trial court make an individualized determination as to whether it was an appropriate sentence, &sect; 18-1.3-401(4)(a) was unconstitutional as applied to juveniles only insofar as it mandated imposition of an LWOP sentence; [3]-On remand, the trial court had to make an individualized sentencing determination based on the factors elucidated in Miller.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-302(1)(b) and (c) (2013) barred different conduct, as the former required a defendant to knowingly threaten or intimidate the victim with a deadly weapon, while the latter did not require a defendant to use a deadly weapon to threaten or intimidate the victim, and a violation of Colo.

Stat. &sect; 16-8.5-102(2)(a), and thus, the period for the competency hearing was properly excluded from the speedy trial computation under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-405(6)(a); [2]-Defendant was subject to crime of violence sentencing because the offense of which he was convicted, i.e., sexual assault on a child by one in position of trust, was a per se crime of violence; [3]-Although the sentencing range should not have been aggravated as an extraordinary risk crime, the sentence length was affirmed as it would not have been different had defendant been sentenced pursuant to a sentencing range aggravated solely by the crime of violence statute.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 12-36.5-203(2) (2012), abrogating hospital immunity for credentialing decisions, was retroactive. HOLDINGS: [1]-The general assembly intended to apply it retroactively because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-36.5-203(2)(c) (2012) said it applied to actions filed on or after July 1, 2012, and, for an action to be &quot;filed&quot; on the effective date, it had to have accrued earlier; [2]-Retroactive application was not unconstitutional because it did not impair defendant hospital's vested contract or property right, since immunity from tort damages did not vest before suit was filed, the hospital previously had a duty of care in credentialing, the hospital operated in a highly regulated industry, and the statute was remedial, as the former statute only provided immunity from compensatory damages and the hospital's immunity was not a vested right.</SPAN></P>

The easement was not required to comply with the notice requirement in the 2003 amendment of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-30.5-104(5) due to a grandfather clause for existing easements, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-30.5-111(2). Landowners therefore could not convey the mutual ditch shares separately.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-107(3)(b)'s procedure for introducing evidence regarding a defendant's mental condition did not impermissibly conflict with Colo. R. Crim. P. 11's lack of any qualification for the introduction of evidence of mental condition; the very absence of specific procedure in Rule 11(e) refuted the existence of a substantial conflict. Therefore, &sect; 16-8-107 did not violate separation of powers principles. The lack of a definition for the term &quot;cooperate&quot; did not render these provisions unconstitutionally vague on their face. compulsory examinations under 16-8-106 and disclosure provisions of 16-8-103.6 and 16-8-107 comported with defendants' constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, the jury could reasonably infer that Bondurant did not have permission from the Hawkinses to enter their property on the date of the charged offenses.</SPAN></P>

Plea counsel did not provide ineffective assistance when they advised appellant that he could be convicted of felony first degree murder under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-102(1)(b) (2011) based on the predicate offense of petty escape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant pleaded guilty to criminal trespass, the trial court ordered him to pay postjudgment interest on the restitution amount. The interest began accruing on the sentencing date. Defendant argued that because he was imprisoned, he could not find a job; thus, requiring him to pay postjudgment interest constituted an excessive fine, which was unconstitutional. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals of Colorado rejected his claim. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-18.5-106(2) (2010) mandated that incarcerated inmates pay a minimum toward any restitution they owed. The restitution order was not a fine, and it was not punitive. Its purpose was to make the victim whole. Because the restitution order itself did not offend the Eighth Amendment and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 20, then the postjudgment interest statute used to encourage prompt payment of that order did not offend those constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university board of regents held a special meeting to consider an essay written by the professor in which he compared the victims of the 9/11 World Trade Center terrorist attack to Nazi war criminals. The board authorized an examination of the professor's works, which uncovered instances of plagiarism, falsification, and fabrication. Following a full hearing, the board voted to dismiss the professor. The professor filed suit alleging that the board violated his rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 by investigating his academic works and terminating him in retaliation for exercising his right to free speech. On review, the court held that the university and board of regents were entitled to quasi-judicial immunity because the process employed shared enough of the features of the traditional judicial process that, for purposes of immunity, it was functionally equivalent to the judicial process. The process by which the decision was reached shared characteristics with the judicial process because it established a multi-step review that provided independent investigation and evaluation by peers, independent faculty members, and elected officials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dependency and neglect proceeding, appellants, a mother and father, challenged the judgment of Montezuma County District Court (Colorado) that terminated their parental rights, arguing that the district court erred in allowing the child's foster parents to fully participate as parties in the termination proceedings. Appellant county agency separately challenged the judgment terminating the mother's parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the county agency and both parents argued that mother, and father maintain that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-3-507(5)(a) (2010) allowed foster parents to intervene as a matter of right but limited their role to providing information about the child, including during the termination hearing. In contrast, the foster parents contended that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-3-507(5)(a) allowed them to fully participate in the termination hearing. On review, the court held that, because the foster parents have no statutory right to intervene in termination proceedings and no liberty interest in the continuation of their relationship with the child, they thus had no legal interest in the determination whether the relationship between the child and his biological parents should be terminated. As such, the trial court erred in allowing the foster parents to participate fully as intervenors in the termination proceeding. As to the father, the error was harmless because the evidence supporting the termination of his parental rights was strong and the grounds for termination of his parental rights likely could have been established without the foster parents' participation in the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the judgment that terminated the father's parental rights was affirmed, but that portion terminating the mother's parental rights was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified that defendant kicked open the door of her home, attacked her, beat her, and touched her breasts and vagina. The information charging defendant with sexual assault was sufficient to advise him that he could be required to defend against the lesser included offense of unlawful sexual contact. Likewise, the information provided fair notice to defendant that he could be required to defend against a burglary charge predicated on the lesser sexual offense. Based on a risk assessment, defendant was declared a sexually violent predator (SVP), additional SVP findings were not required. The testimony of a police fingerprint technician supported the trial court's findings that defendant was a habitual criminal, despite a discrepancy in the date of a conviction. The habitual criminal counts did not have to be submitted to a jury. The trial court sentenced defendant to forty-eight years for burglary and twenty-four years to life for unlawful sexual contact. The sentences were not constitutionally disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The El Paso County District Court, Colorado, granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, law enforcement entities, on plaintiff metal recycler's declaratory judgment concerning Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-4-2202 and 42-5-105 (2010), as well as injunctive relief. The recycler appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on the definitions of &quot;motor vehicle&quot; in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-1-102(58) and 42-5-101(5) (2010), the recycler sought a declaratory judgment that the General Assembly intended Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-2202 (2010) to apply only to &quot;self-propelled&quot; vehicles or non-rail vehicles &quot;propelled by any power other than muscular,&quot; and that this excluded a &quot;scrap partial vehicle shell.&quot; The recycler contended that if &sect; 42-4-2202 was not so limited, it was unconstitutionally vague on its face. The appellate court found that &sect; 42-4-2202 was not void for vagueness on its face. It did not inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights. The recycler did not argue that the statute could not be applied to a vehicle that was readily identified as a motor vehicle and arrived at the recycler under its own power. The definition of &quot;motor vehicle&quot; meant a motor vehicle that was self-propelled. The statute was not unconstitutional as applied to the recycler. The recycler's claim for declaratory relief was ripe as to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-5-105 (2010) because the statute did not require recording identification numbers for every used motor vehicle the recycler accepted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the recycler's claim that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-5-105(1)(v)(V) applied only to &quot;motor vehicles&quot; and the case was remanded to the district court to enter a declaratory judgment accordingly; the judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The El Paso County District Court, Colorado, granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed appellant resident's suit against appellees, city, city public facilities authority (PFA), and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), challenging the constitutional legitimacy of the Economic Development Agreement (EDA) entered into between appellees. The resident appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident argued that the trial court erred in granting the city's motion for judgment on the pleadings concerning the first claim stated in his complaint: that the certificates may not be issued unless first authorized by an election. The appellate court noted that it made no difference that the financing scheme involved collateral other than the facility on which revenue from the sale of the bonds or securities was allocated because the city's discretion to appropriate monies remained the same. It was undisputed that the certificates did not pledge any specific source of revenue for repayment. Even if the PFA's obligation to the investors could become the city's, the investors remained entitled only to an interest in the annually appropriated lease purchase agreement, to the extent the city chose to fund it with appropriations from its general fund. An election was not required unless there was an affirmative obligation placed upon the city to renew, which did not occur. The resident did not abandon his other claims.</SPAN></P>

The part of the judgment dismissing the resident's remaining two claims was reversed, and remanded for the trial court to reinstate that portion of the complaint and for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant inmate sought review of an order from the Fremont County District Court (Colorado), which convicted him of four counts of second-degree assault and sentenced him to four consecutive 10-year prison terms to be served consecutively to the sentence he was already serving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On three separate occasions, the inmate assaulted correctional officers using feces and urine. He was convicted of four counts of second-degree assault under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-203(1)(f.5) (2009). He was sentenced to four consecutive 10-year prison terms to be served consecutively to the sentence he was already serving. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in refusing to give the inmate's tendered jury instruction, which stated that the jury could consider evidence of his mental illness to determine whether he had the requisite culpable mental state for assault at the time of the attacks. The instruction was cumulative to those that were given, and those instructions accurately informed the jury of the governing law. Defense counsel had argued to the jury that the prosecutor failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the inmate's actions were voluntary and that he had the requisite culpable mental state. The trial court did not err in applying Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(8)(a)(IV) to enhance his sentences. The statute under which he was charged did not contain specific sentencing requirements superseding the provisions of the enhancement statute.</SPAN></P>
