</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to authority granted under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.073.6 (2000), appellant state attorney general brought suit against respondents, a city, a county collector, and a county clerk, requesting a determination that a general revenue tax levied by the city was unlawful and seeking an injunction to prohibit collection of the tax. The Circuit Court of Holt County (Missouri) denied the petition for injunctive relief. The attorney general appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city contended that S.B. 894, the legislation that created Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.073, was unconstitutional because it violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 23. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.073 granted to the attorney general authority to bring the suit against the city. The court declined to grant relief to the attorney general. In a prior decision from the state supreme court, it was determined that the phrase &quot;relating to property ownership&quot; in the title to S.B. 894 could have referred to almost any legislation that the General Assembly passed; therefore, it was held that the title failed to give notice of the bill's actual content or subject matter, in violation of the clear title requirement of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 23. Because the title was overly broad, the supreme court did not just strike down portions of the bill; rather, it struck down the entire bill as unconstitutional. The court explained that it necessarily followed that any legislation established by S.B. 894 was void. Therefore, the court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.073, having been created by an unconstitutional measure, was void and that the attorney general had no authority to bring the suit against the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators, candidate and voter, sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, county legislature, county, county board of election commissioners, and city board of election commissioners, to file and process the candidate's declaration of candidacy for the office of county legislator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate sought to place her name on the appropriate ballot as a candidate, and the voter asserted that she was a registered voter, and that her right to vote for the candidate of her choice would be illegally restrained, if the candidate's name was precluded from appearing on the primary ballot. The appellate court found that the clerk of the county legislature was not a named party, although she denied the candidate's application for candidacy. The clerk was the official who was compelled to accept a declaration that otherwise met the legal requirements for filing. The clerk was the necessary and indispensable party when seeking a writ of mandamus from a court to compel the filing of a declaration of candidacy for the county legislature. Admitting that the candidate would not have been a qualified voter of the county for three years preceding the election, the relators' petition in mandamus would have the appellate court adjudicate the constitutionality of the Jackson County, Mo., Charter, art. II, &sect; 5 and the United States and Missouri Constitutions, which was inappropriate in mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of sexual abuse, one count of kidnapping, and two corresponding counts of armed criminal action. The Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, convicted and sentenced him as a predatory sexual offender. Defendant filed a motion for post-conviction relief, which the motion court denied without holding an evidentiary hearing. Defendant appealed the denial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant as a predatory sexual offender based on two forcible sodomies that occurred previously in Kansas. The appellate court found that defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.018.5(2) was merely colorable and he failed to properly raise a claim that any statute was unconstitutional. When defendant entered his plea of guilty, &sect; 558.018.5(2) was presumed constitutional, and defendant's plea counsel was held only to the state of the law at the time of the guilty plea. The only claim of ineffectiveness of plea counsel in defendant's post-conviction motion was based on plea counsel's failure to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 558.018.5(2). Because that claim was refuted, his counsel was not ineffective and the motion court did not clearly err in denying defendant's motion without holding an evidentiary hearing. The evidence which defendant claimed should not have been considered was evidence pertaining to the commission of the prior sexual offenses that enhanced his sentence under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.018. Thus, it was not improper for the court to consider the circumstances of the offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the motion court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion in his criminal case pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.07(d) (2001) to withdraw a guilty plea entered two years previously to a first-degree assault charge. The Circuit Court of Newton County, Missouri, denied the motion, and defendant, pro se, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that no factual basis was established at the plea hearing on which to accept a guilty plea, as the evidence did not establish an intent to attempt to kill or cause serious physical injury, the severity of the victim's injuries, or that the victim's injuries were attributable to defendant. Further, defendant contended Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.02 (2001) prohibited a court from entering a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it determined that a factual basis existed for the plea. The appellate court noted that defendant had previously filed a Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035 (2001) motion that alleged ineffective assistance of counsel but failed to allege noncompliance with Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.02 (2001) by acceptance of a plea without a factual basis. The court found that defendant had, therefore, waived any claim that he should have been allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty based on an allegedly insufficient factual basis to accept the plea under Rule 24.02. The court also found that defendant's contention, that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.050 (2000) was unconstitutionally vague, was waived due to defendant's failure to raise the issue prior to his plea of guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's denial of defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>

The prospective therapist's assistant appealed the board's decision to the Administrative Hearing Commission. The board sought judicial review of the commission's decision in the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri. The trial court denied a motion to stay. The board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prospective therapist's assistant graduated from an accredited associate program of physical therapy education. The prospective therapist's assistant took the physical therapy assistant licensing examination three times, and each time failed to achieve the minimum score necessary to pass it and obtain her license. The assistant applied to take the physical therapy assistant licensing exam for a fourth time. The board denied her application pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;334.655.3 (2000). The appeal involved the statutory interpretation of an amendment of this statute, which barred candidates from taking the physical therapist assistant licensing examination more than three times. Based on clearly expressed legislative intent, and the procedural nature of the statute, the appellate court concluded that retrospective application was proper. The amendment to &sect; 334.655.3 changed only the procedural rules for the prospective therapist assistant licensing exam; the prospective therapist's assistant could not avoid its application. The revised statute applied to all candidates who failed the exam three times, whether or not those failures occurred prior to enactment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The employee claimed that he was exposed to a high level of noise. After he told the employer that he was developing hearing problems, he was transferred. The commission found that two doctors had made two errors in their calculations in determining the amount of hearing loss. The commission further found that both doctors had erred in using a certain formula by calculating the hearing loss after correction for age. The appellate court determined that the commission's re-calculation of the percentage of disability was based on an erroneous interpretation and application of the law, based on the highest, rather than the lowest, decibel levels recorded in each frequency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Missouri Division of Family Services (DFS) decided that there was probable cause to suspect petitioner, a day care administrator, of child neglect after a two-year-old in the day care center drank a sports bottle with a bleach solution used for cleaning. She sought judicial review and the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) determined that there was substantial evidence to support the decision. The administrator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator contended the trial court erred in finding that her actions and omissions constituted &quot;neglect&quot; as defined by Mo. Rev. Stat. Ann.  &sect; 210.110 (2000). She argued that the term &quot;lack of supervision&quot; was not defined in the neglect statute. The appellate court held that the child neglect statute did not relate exclusively to family situations, but applied to her as anyone who had responsibility for the care of a child. The appellate court further concluded the administrator's actions demonstrated the failure to provide for the child's well-being and constituted neglect as defined by the statute. The administrator alleged that the phrase &quot;well-being&quot; was vague. The appellate court found the term was not void for vagueness because it adequately described the proscribed conduct. The administrator contended that the trial court erred in finding probable cause because the child did not suffer any actual injury. The appellate court disagreed. After ingesting the bleach solution, the child cried and vomited several times and was taken to the emergency room. The administrator was not the prevailing party and thus was not entitled to attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was killed as result of a collision with the driver's vehicle. The driver was intoxicated when the collision occurred. The children alleged that the employees of the bar knowingly provided alcohol to the driver after he was obviously intoxicated. The trial court granted the bar's motion on the ground that the children's action was barred because the bar was not convicted or did not plead guilty to the offense of selling liquor to an obviously intoxicated person under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 311.310 (2000) within one year after the accident occurred. The bar argued that it was immune from liability based on its lack of a criminal prosecution within one year after accident. The appellate court held that since the bar knew that under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.053.3 (2000), it could be subject to liability if its sale of alcohol to an obviously intoxicated person was the proximate cause of injury or death to a third party, the bar suffered no injustice as a result of its reliance that it was free from liability based on the lack of a criminal prosecution within one year after the accident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An amended information charged defendant with tampering, by knowingly, and without the consent of the owner, possessing a vehicle. Defendant was also charged with attempting to manufacture methamphetamine. Defendant moved to sever the charges. The motion was denied by the Circuit Court of Newton County, Missouri. Defendant was convicted by a jury. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found hiding in the back bedroom of an apartment that contained a working methamphetamine laboratory. Keys to a stolen van were found in a sweatshirt defendant had taken off. Behind the license plates of the van, methamphetamine was found. On appeal, the issue was raised as to whether the offenses were properly joined in the indictment. Under the facts of the case, the two offenses were connected within the ordinary meaning of that term. In determining whether the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to sever, the appellate court noted that the general allegation that the jury would likely consider evidence of guilt on one charge as evidence of guilt on another charge did not meet the requirement of a particularized showing of substantial prejudice. Nor did the motion present a cause for severance by reason of the general allegation that defendant might wish to testify on one charge, but not the other. Moreover, that situation was far from the facts in this case. Finally, the evidence necessary to convict defendant for possession of a stolen vehicle charge was distinct from that necessary to convict for the attempt to manufacture methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>

The schools appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The schools challenged the language in Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 4, &sect; 197-2.010, that required an applicant for a massage therapist license to submit a transcript showing he or she had completed a massage therapy program taught by instructors who have (1) practiced professionally for at least two years, (2) a bachelor's degree or minor in a healthcare related field to teach anatomy or physiology, (3) documentable experience/education in a related field, and (4) certification in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The appellate court determined that the applicants' claim that the board's regulation was invalid because it invaded the alleged exclusive statutory authority given by the legislature to the Missouri Coordinating Board of Higher Education had no merit. Moreover, the state had a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from incompetent massage therapists. Once a legitimate interest was articulated, all that remained was whether the means were rationally related to achieving that purpose. Finally, the applicants' constitutional arguments were not properly raised and presented to the trial court, and were not properly before the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

The homeowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner challenged the Weed Ordinance (ordinance), Platte County Zoning Reg., Mo., art. III, &sect; 21, as unconstitutionally vague because it failed to provide adequate notice to the public and sufficient standards for enforcement. The condition of the homeowner's property constituted a violation of the ordinance. The vegetative growth on the homeowner's property was more than 12 inches high, had not been purchased at a nursery, and had not been cultivated. There was nothing vague or ambiguous about the ordinance's weed definition that encouraged Platte County to arbitrarily or capriciously enforce it against the homeowner. The homeowner's constitutional challenge was not raised during the trial, therefore he failed to preserve it for review. The homeowner was entitled to a ruling from the Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA) regarding the asserted existence of his vested property rights. The BZA failed to apply the correct standard under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.090(3) (2000). The homeowner did not show that the ordinance proceedings against him were for the same offense that he was criminally prosecuted for under another ordinance, therefore there was no double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's land was located in both a town and the city. He attempted to transfer jurisdiction to the town under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 72.424 (Cum. Supp. 1999), dealing with jurisdiction over a &quot;tract&quot; located in more than one municipality. When the city refused to recognize the transfer, the owner filed suit. After &sect; 72.424 was amended, the owner notified the town that he intended to transfer his property to the town under that law. The town passed an ordinance to accept jurisdiction over the land, and the owner amended his petition to include claims under &sect; 72.424. The appellate court held that as the city had no administrative jurisdiction over the owner's election to belong to the town, he was not obliged to exhaust administrative remedies. The fact that the land consisted of four parcels did not mean it was not a &quot;tract;&quot; therefore, &sect; 72.424 was applicable. As the reference in &sect; 72.424 to a county of the first classification was a clear legislative error, that section applied to the owner's land. As the city failed to adequately plead its affirmative defenses of exhaustion of administrative remedies and unconstitutionality, summary judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed a motion pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 542.301 (1995) for the return of property seized by police in a criminal investigation of her son. The Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, denied the motion, and she appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son was arrested on controlled substances charges. He told police there was money in a safe at his mother's home, where he had a room. He consented to a search of his mother's home, described the safe and its location, and gave its combination. The mother told police that she didn't know anything about any safes, and said they could search and take any safe they found. Police retrieved two safes, and found about $ 55,800 in cash, but no contraband. The mother filed her Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 542.301 motion in the criminal court where her son was charged, and with the same caption. The appellate court held that this was procedurally improper, but as the State had not objected, its motion to dismiss the appeal on this basis was denied. The appellate court deferred to the trial court's finding that the testimony of the mother, and of her daughter, who also claimed to own the safes, was incredible. The son's hearsay statements as to his ownership of the safes were not objected to, and were substantial evidence in support of the trial court's finding. The mother's prior inconsistent statements were further substantive evidence that her title to the property was defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an amended information, the State charged defendant with possession of acetone, lithium batteries, salt, denatured alcohol and lab paraphernalia with the intent to manufacture a controlled substance. A jury in the Circuit Court of Scott County, Missouri, convicted defendant of possession of chemicals with the intent to create a controlled substance in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.420 (2000). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A detective went to the home in which defendant resided to investigate a possible case of child endangerment. During the detective's search of the home, the detective found a laundry basket containing clothes, which defendant admitted belonged to him. Later, the detective searched the laundry basket more thoroughly and found lithium batteries, and acetone. The State's only burden under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.420.3 (2000) was to prove by expert testimony that lithium was a component of or was used to produce methamphetamine. The State bore its burden and was not required to adduce evidence to support the definition of &quot;immediate precursor&quot; found in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.010 (2000). The failure of the evidence to establish that defendant knew of the illegal nature of acetone and lithium did not constitute insufficiency of the evidence. Although the verdict director deviated from model jury instructions, this deviation was not prejudicial. Defendant made no attempt to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the variance or how it resulted in manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice. Finally, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.420 (2000) was determined to not be unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court erred by failing to void the adoption judgment where the constitutional flaw of absolutely no effort to notify potentially adverse parties was essential and that it deprived the adoption court of jurisdiction. The father lacked standing to assert any deprivation of rights of the putative father. The adoptive father was not injured from the failure of the adoption court to notify the putative father of the adoption proceedings. The adoptive father requested to adopt the child, and his petition was granted. Even if the father had standing, by not raising the issue at the adoption proceedings, he failed to preserve the issue for appellate review. The court had jurisdiction because the putative father was not an interested party and was not entitled to notice of the adoption. All parties resided in the county and the parties voluntarily subjected themselves to the adoption court's jurisdiction. There was no indication in the record that any putative father, even if ascertainable to the court or the parents, had ever acknowledged the child or affirmatively asserted his paternity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state agency initiated an administrative child support modification proceeding to increase appellant father's child support obligation. The state agency ordered the father to pay more for child support. The father appealed to the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which affirmed the state agency's decision. The father appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the father's marriage was dissolved, the mother was given custody of their child and the father was ordered to pay child support. After an injury to the child, a medical malpractice settlement was reached and a trust was established to administer the proceeds of the settlement. The child received monthly distributions from the trust and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. The state agency found the corpus of the trust, SSI benefits, and employment income paid to the child should not be considered in calculating the amount of the father's child support obligation. On appeal, the court found that the child's income from the special needs trust did not make the presumptive correct child support amount unjust or inappropriate. Further, the child's SSI benefits did not make the presumptive correct child support amount unjust or inappropriate. However, without a finding of fact addressing the evidence of the child's employment income, the court was unable to determine whether the state agency erred by not finding that the child's employment income rebutted the presumed correct child support amount.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed. The cause was remanded to the trial court with directions to remand the cause to the state agency so that the state agency could enter proper findings of fact concerning the child's employment income and its effect, if any, on the presumed correct child support amount.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon remand, the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, made findings that both appellant father and the child's mother were unsuitable custodians, that the welfare of the child required third-party custody, and that it was in the best interests of the child that custody be placed with respondent grandmother. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child had lived with her grandmother during her first two years. During the time that the child lived with both parents, the grandmother participated in the child's care. Neither parent significantly supported the child during any of the time she was in the grandmother's care. The appellate court declined to review the father's constitutional arguments. The evidence demonstrated that the father had a poor history of financially supporting the child. The father allowed the mother's use of drugs to involve the child and failed to take action to protect the child. There was very little positive evidence of the father's qualification to have custody of the child. The evidence supported a finding of unfitness and unsuitability. The trial court made findings of fact to show that the non-parent, the grandmother, carried her burden to overcome a rebuttable presumption against awarding her custody, then found both parents to be unsuitable. Only then did the trial court make a finding that the welfare of the child required placement with the grandmother.</SPAN></P>

The parties amended their agreement to delete the first competitive bidding participant's requirement to abide by prevailing wage laws, including the Missouri Prevailing Wage Law (Law), Mo. Rev. State.  &sect; 290.210 (1994). The parties avoided such laws by stating that their contract was not a public works contract. The union representatives requested a declaration that the contract was subject to the Law and that the first competitive bidding participant had to pay prevailing wages. The union representatives did not do any work on the project and were strangers to the contract. After summary judgment was granted to the competitive bidding participants, the appellate court found the union representatives did not have standing to challenge the contract, especially because their grievance that the prevailing wage laws applied was the grievance of a competitor, not one shared by the taxpaying public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents urged that the judge's interlocutory order violated their right to due process of law in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment, that there was no statutory authority authorizing temporary relief in a grandparent visitation case, that the trial court improperly applied a presumption favoring grandparent visitation and placed the burden on them to rebut such presumption, and that the visitation ordered exceeds the &quot;minimal intrusion&quot; approved. It was not necessary to reach the parents's constitutional challenges in order to resolve the writ proceeding, because the trial court had not yet ruled on the parents's motion to dismiss on those grounds.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trapper sued defendant city requesting injunctive relief and a judgment declaring void an ordinance that required persons seeking to hunt or trap on government lands within that city to first obtain permission from the government owning the property. The Circuit Court of the County of St. Louis, Missouri, dismissed the trapper's petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The trapper appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trapper claimed that Town &amp; Country, Mo., Ordinance No. 2078, was invalid under Missouri law. The appellate court found that the conservation commission was not vested with exclusive authority to regulate hunting, trapping, and fishing and that the commission's constitutional and statutory authority did not prevent landowners from imposing conditions on the right to hunt or trap on their land. It also found that the specific statutory delegation of police powers to municipalities of the fourth class under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79.110 allowed the city to exercise general police powers and to pass ordinances for the health and safety of its citizens. The ordinance in question served a legitimate police function by requiring persons to obtain permission before hunting or trapping so that a governmental owner who granted permission then had an opportunity to warn others that hunting and trapping were occurring on the property. The appellate court held that this was a reasonable exercise of the police power because it focused on the safety of its citizens and allowed governmental property owners control over activities on their property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband contended that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the court order of protection. The husband denied the truth of the wife's accusations and attempted to show inconsistencies and improbabilities in her testimony. The trial court, however, could have believed the wife. The husband pointed out that there were no allegations of any physical or verbal confrontations, any threats, any acts of trespass or any type of unlawful activity or interference of custody. The appellate court was reluctant to say that the husband, as the non-custodial parent, could not legitimately drive by the house occupied by his child, or park nearby to observe the child playing, when that occurred on only two occasions. There was no indication that the husband sought to draw the wife's attention to his presence or that his activities were directed at the wife. There was no testimony of any threats or hateful gestures or evidence of any attempt to alarm the wife or cause her distress. The husband's activities did not constitute a lawful basis for the entering of a full order of protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insured requested judicial review in the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, alleging that respondent Missouri Director of Insurance's determination that her chiropractic treatments were not medically necessary was unlawful, and in excess of his statutory authority. The insured appealed the judgment the trial court, affirming the decision of the director, and denying her grievance against respondent insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured had a health insurance policy administered and reinsured by the insurer. The insured received treatment three times a week from a chiropractor for tightness in her neck and shoulders. The insurer performed a medical review, and denied coverage of the chiropractic treatments. At issue was whether the insured's chiropractic treatments were medically necessary. The director's decision that no objective evidence existed of neuromuscular or orthopedic disease, no recorded or experienced radicular symptoms existed, and no neurosurgical evidence existed, except for cervical spondylosis, was unsupported by the record. The ultimate conclusion, that the treatment was not medically necessary, was based upon erroneous findings, which were material to the decision. Further, the director's findings that multiple entries in the neurosurgical chart noted that the patient requested continuing chiropractic treatments was inadequate to lead to the conclusion that the treatments were merely for convenience. The director's conclusion was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the director was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court with directions to remand the matter to the director.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed their initial petition against a doctor and two hospitals alleging that the deaths of a mother and her twins were the result of a failure to monitor and treat liver damage caused by the administration of the anti-hypertension drug. The pharmaceutical company was the manufacturer of the drug. The pharmaceutical company was a foreign corporation and had never had a registered agent in Missouri. The appellate court found that Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 537.100 (1994) required that the cause of action to be tolled if personal service could not be had upon the pharmaceutical company in Missouri. Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 506.510 (1994) provided that service via the long-arm statute had the same force and effect as though the process had been served within Missouri. The pharmaceutical company could have been served via the long-arm statutes and thus, the running of the statute of limitations on appellants' claims was not tolled.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court disagreed. It first held that the court properly excluded evidence of the victim's prior sexual victimization, because the State did not present the same suggesting that his knowledge came from the encounter with the defendant. Further, because the court granted an alternative request from the defendant, it did not err in refusing to declare a mistrial. Finally, because the statutory change relied upon did not take place before his sentencing, and, in fact, did not happen until nearly three years later, defendant was not entitled to be treated as if he was not convicted of what the law then defined as sodomy and thus avoid the status of a persistent offender.</SPAN></P>

The guards told him they were following the commission's rules. The partner used profanity in telling the guards to forget the rules and get the people on board. The commission found the use of profanity in discussing the commission's rules was misconduct and that there was no authorization for the consumption of alcoholic beverages in the non-gaming areas of the casino. On appeal, the court found the partner did not commit misconduct by using profanity in referring to the commission since the partner's misconduct was not willful.

Upon arrival, the trooper found an unattended taxi cab upside down in the roadway. The trooper testified it took him only a few minutes to arrive at the scene after the report, and another trooper arrived only a few minutes after that. Because of the dangerous position of the upside-down cab on the roadway, and the proximity of the convenience store, it would have appeared unlikely to the officers that there was a significant delay in the reporting of the crash. The cab was checked out to the person believed to be the driver. The driver had fresh cuts and blood on both hands, which would seem consistent with an attempt to get out of an upside-down vehicle that had rolled over. His clothes were &quot;messy.&quot; The trial court held that the director had failed to show that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that person was driving, but that conclusion was not supported by substantial evidence and was against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought a refund of an overpayment of taxes under the Hancock Amendment because the rounding formula prescribed by the State Auditor and utilized by the tax district resulted in an unconstitutional application of Mo.

The trial court denied the claim since the imprecision resulting from the inevitable rounding process was not so significant as to be a violation of the Hancock Amendment. On appeal, the court found the claims asserted by the taxpayers as purported class representatives were neither properly nor timely filed. Because the taxpayers were the only named class representatives and their claims were time barred, the putative class lacked representation and should not have been certified. The taxpayers' individual claim for one year which was amounted to such an insubstantial sum that it did not violate the Hancock Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed. Shortly before the threat, the victim observed the defendant bending down by her car. She then found that two of her tires had been slashed, and she believed the defendant had done it. Sufficient evidence was presented from which a reasonable trier of fact could find that the defendant unreasonably or knowingly disturbed or alarmed the victim and that his apparent conduct and his threatening statement in the victim's presence were likely to cause a reasonable person to fear that he might carry out his threat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendant for driving at night with her lights off. The officer arrested defendant for driving under the influence when she failed field sobriety tests. At trial, defendant objected to the verdict director on the grounds the definition of intoxication did not adequately inform the jury as to what the offense of intoxication was. The trial court overruled the objection. On appeal, defendant argued the definition of intoxication in Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 577.001 (1994) was unconstitutionally vague, that the trial court erred in overruling her objection to the verdict director, and that the State failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that she was intoxicated while driving her car. On appeal, the court found that defendant failed to properly assert and preserve her challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 577.001; therefore the appellate court had jurisdiction over the case. Further, defendant did not preserve her constitutional challenge to the verdict director. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents sued appellant in the Franklin County Circuit Court (Missouri) alleging an agreement between appellant and a county for construction of a road was an illegal exercise of appellant's power. The trial court partly granted respondents' summary judgment motion, and certified its judgment as final for purposes of appeal, under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 74.01(b). Appellant sought review and respondents cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order partially granting respondents' summary judgment motion resolved a distinct judicial unit and was, therefore, properly appealable, once certified by the trial court as final and appealable. Appellant's agreement with a county did not obligate it to pursue any purpose outside its powers. Appellant did not have to be able to exercise the functions called for in the agreement independently before it could legitimately enter into the challenged agreement. The agreement did not unlawfully delegate to appellant the county's power to condemn land within its boundaries because it obligated the county to proceed with condemnation procedures. There was a genuine fact issue whether the road led to and from appellant, and its construction was thus within appellant's statutory appropriations authority under Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 71.340. The state highway commission did not have exclusive authority to reserve a corridor for road development under Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 226.950. The trial court's partial denial of respondents' summary judgment motion was not reviewable on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was a county collector in a second-class county.

The trial court found appellant was due compensation, but not prejudgment interest, for the county's breach of the agreement. The appellate court found that, under Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 50.332 (2000), appellant was entitled to compensation for collecting municipal taxes under the agreement for the years 1988 to 1996. Since appellant obtained the approval of the county's governing body to enter into the agreement, when the county became a first-class county &sect; 50.332 continued to govern and appellant was entitled to the agreed compensation.

Whether or not appellant could meet its burden of proof was a question of fact to be tested by summary judgment or trial, and not by a motion to dismiss. Appellant also pleaded sufficient facts to support causes of action for inverse condemnation and for a constitutional violation. At the time of the first judgment for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment, it was unknown when, or if, respondent would rezone the parcel.</SPAN></P>

The court had no jurisdiction to review the evidence appellant considered in making its decision, as there was no right to a hearing prior to removal from a treatment program. Appellant was not entitled to declaratory relief because he admitted that his participation in the program had been terminated, Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant argued that an administrative agency head could not delegate duties assigned to him or her by statute unless a statute expressly or impliedly permitted such delegation. The appellate court disagreed and found that the regulation at issue did expressly delegate the dress code formulation duty and that even had it not done so, the authority to delegate the creation of a dress code could reasonably be implied from the nature of the duties involved. The appellate court also noted that in future cases parties should recognize the distinction drawn between the principles governing statutory construction in regard to the authority to delegate and principles governing interpretation of policy directives that implement an authority that all recognize. A director had the authority to delegate dress code development should the director choose to do so.</SPAN></P>

The driver of the van was found to be acting in an official capacity when she was transporting appellant and the other inmates; therefore, the appellate court held that the statute applied to appellant's injury claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent filed a petition for readjustment of benefits. After publication of notice, service on persons recorded in the assessor's office, and a hearing, the petition was granted, and commissioners were appointed to reassess the benefits conferred upon the owners of property. Appellant filed exceptions to the assessment of respondent benefits against its property located within the levee district, alleging the assessment was excessive and requesting a trial. The appellate court affirmed, vending: notice was proper; the legislature must have intended for the &quot;other purposes and contingencies&quot; relating to the maintenance of state highways to include levee district assessments for benefits conferred; it was evident the special assessments at issue were not a tax in violation of the Hancock Amendment; the assessment against lands owned by appellant was authorized, and therefore did not violate the Missouri Constitution; the trial court was within its discretion in controlling discovery and denying appellant's request for a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed, finding substantial evidence supported the trial court's determination that the commissioners' report assessing benefits had a rational basis, was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious. The trial court did not err in affirming the assessment of benefits. The assessments were not a tax in violation of the Hancock Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a petition for declaratory judgment and injunction in the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) against respondent city and commissioner of revenue which challenged respondent city's imposition of an increase in the convention and tourism tax. The trial court granted summary judgment for respondents, and appellant challenged that ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 92.327 was amended in 1999 to allow cities to increase the convention and tourism sales tax. Prior to the effective date of the amendment, respondent city passed an ordinance that authorized submission of the tax increase question to the voters. The voters' approval of the proposition and respondent city's amendment of the existing tax ordinance also took place before the effective date of amended &sect; 92.327. Respondent city argued that the tax increase was valid because the ordinance that actually imposed the increase became effective after the effective date of the enabling statute. The appellate court held that the ordinance authorizing the election to approve the tax, and the election itself, were not authorized under the version of &sect; 92.327 that was in effect at the time. Because the election was invalid, respondent city lacked the required voter approval to impose the tax increase. Respondent's status as a constitutional charter city did not provide an alternative avenue of authorization for the increase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded to the trial court with directions to enter summary judgment for appellant. Respondent could not conduct a valid election on the tax increase question prior to the effective date of the enabling statute, and without a valid election the ordinance imposing the tax increase was also invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, in the Circuit Court of Platte County (Missouri) of driving while intoxicated, contrary to Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 577.010 (1994) and was sentenced as a prior and persistent intoxication-related offender, Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 577.023 (1994), and a prior and persistent offender, Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 558.016 (1994), to eight years in prison. He appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that it was error to admit the results of a pre-arrest breath test against him, in his prosecution for driving while intoxicated, because there was no evidence the testing device or procedure had been approved by the health department. While Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 577.026 (Supp. 1997) indicated that breath tests were to be performed according to methods approved by the health department, the subsequently adopted and more specific Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 577.021 (Supp. 1997), which applied specifically to the breath test administered to defendant, was exempt from that requirement and, under principles of statutory construction, controlled over the more general statute. Defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 577.023 (Supp. 1998) could not be considered because he did not raise it at the earliest opportunity and because it was not the statute applied to him when the trial court imposed sentence, so he had no standing..</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was affirmed because the pre-arrest breath test administered to the defendant, and admitted in evidence against him, was not subject to the statutory requirement applicable to blood alcohol tests that they be done pursuant to procedures approved by the health department. Defendant did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a sentencing statute not applied to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his jury convictions for assault on a law enforcement officer and armed criminal action, asserting the State failed to present sufficient evidence to sustain the assault conviction. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction, holding the State was required to show that appellant knew or was aware that the victim was a law enforcement officer, but did not have to show that the officer, at the time of the alleged assault, was engaged in the performance of the duties imposed upon him by law. Further, the State was not required to show that the victim was acting constitutionally in carrying out his official duties during the incident in question. As such, the State's evidence showing that the victim of the assault was a law enforcement officer, as defined in Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 556.061(17) (Supp. 1999), of which the appellant was well aware, and that he was acting in his official capacity as a police officer at the pertinent times in question.

Respondent father waived his constitutional points by failing to raise them earlier. The finding of jurisdiction over respondents' baby was not a final appealable order. Many of respondent mother's arguments on appeal were not reviewable because they failed to address the proceedings below or to present proper argument.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators city election board and candidate for president of the United States separately filed petitions seeking to prohibit respondent judge, of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), from enforcing her order directing relator city election board to extend the hours of voting at all city polling places until 10:00 p.m. on November 7, 2000 and to keep its headquarters open until 11:59 p.m. on the same date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent's order was issued in a lawsuit filed against relator board on November 7, 2000, by plaintiffs private citizen, a candidate for president of the United States, and others. Plaintiffs' petition alleged plaintiff citizen, a registered voter residing in the city at issue, had not been able to vote and feared he would not be able to vote because of long lines at the polling places and voting machine breakdowns in the city that had lasted for several hours. The petition further alleged that, due to the large voter turnout and an inadequate number of polling places, many otherwise eligible voters would de facto be denied their right to vote contrary to the United States and Missouri Constitutions. At the conclusion of the hearing, respondent entered her order extending the voting hours at all polling places in the city. Upon review, the court issued peremptory writs of prohibition because respondent lacked jurisdiction to extend the hours of voting established by state statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 115.407 (1994). Respondent had no authority to authorize voters who did not come to the polls during the hours established by the legislature to participate in the election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Peremptory writ was issued; respondent judge improperly extended the hours of voting at polling places within city. Respondent made no finding that the applicable state election law was unconstitutional either as written or as applied. Nor did plaintiffs make such an allegation. Extending the hours of voting would have improperly permitted voting by persons not entitled to vote due to their failure to come to the polls on time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Exceptor Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission appealed the Circuit Court of Marion County's (Missouri) judgment for appellee drainage district on appellee's readjustment of benefits, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 242, for property owned by exceptor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court formed appellee drainage district in 1914 pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 242. Exceptor Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission acquired lands within appellee and constructed two highways there. Appellee raised and strengthened levees in 1950 to protect more land from flooding. Land values rose and appellee petitioned for reassessment of benefits, to include exceptor. Appellee's boundary was ordered extended, and commissioners were appointed to perform reassessment. Benefits over $ 4 million were assessed exceptor and it was required to pay $ 24,888 per year. A &quot;summary&quot; proceeding affirmed the commissioners' report. The court affirmed. Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 226.220 authorized state road funds to go to contingencies related to maintaining state roads. Appellee's assessments were not a tax, but payments for specific benefits. Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 242.260 authorized assessing a government agency; thus there was no unconstitutional tax on the state. Section 242 also allowed for summary proceedings. The fact that the commissioners considered the costs of shuttle boats used in a flood did not make the assessment inconsistent with assessments for other counties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Assessments were not a &quot;tax,&quot; and statutes authorized state road funds from government agency, such as exceptor, to go to highway &quot;contingencies.&quot; Statute also authorized &quot;summary&quot; (non-jury) proceeding and assessors' consideration of boat use during flood did not make assessment inconsistent with those for other counties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought a judgment declaring that the decisions of respondent agency increasing the licensure fees charged to private security officers seeking limited police powers in Kansas City, Missouri, were the result of illegal rulemaking, praying for injunctive relief, actual damages, and additional relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Petitioners appealed a decision of a federal district court granting summary judgment for respondent on petitioners' &sect; 1983 claims. Respondent cross-appealed from the state trial court's decision finding that respondent's fee increases were illegal. The court affirmed. The court concluded that it was without jurisdiction to review a judgment of a federal district court. Regarding the cross-appeal, because the parties had inappropriately stipulated to matters of law, the trial court was free to disregard the stipulations and make a conclusion of its own. Respondent had failed to comply with the notice and comment procedures laid out in Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 536.021 when it increased the fees, such that respondent's rule was properly found to have been void. Also, the state trial court did not err in awarding petitioners retroactive damages.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, appellants filed a petition for writ of mandamus, seeking to compel respondent clerk to certify and place on the ballot at a municipal election their initiative and referendum proposals. The trial court granted a preliminary writ of mandamus. Respondent clerk and respondent intervenors filed separate motions to dismiss appellants' mandamus petition. After a hearing, the trial court quashed the preliminary writ of mandamus and dismissed appellants' mandamus petition. Appellants filed an appeal. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment, for the following reasons: (1) appellants' proposals to repeal a TIARA-related ordinance did not contain the required number of qualified signers at the time of filing; and (2) appellants' proposals to amend the city charter to require approval of two-thirds of the voters to adopt any TIARA project were facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Respondent had to wind down her business and needed to devote extra time and attention to her children after the divorce. Expenses from children's activities, including ice skating lessons, gymnastics, and French lessons were properly included as extraordinary expenses. The items were not duplicative of those in the child support/maintenance amounts. The trial court did not err in ordering parties to pursue mediation regarding disputes over child custody and visitation. However, enforcement of the mediation provision concerning property division was overbroad because Mo. R. Civ. P. 88.04 did not provide for enforced mediation of property division.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In proceedings in the lower court, respondent circuit court judge issued a ruling denying relator state the right to a jury trial on relator's petition seeking a determination that the detainee was a sexually violent predator under Missouri's Sexually Violent Predator Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 632.480-.513 (Cum. Supp. 1999). Relator requested a writ of prohibition to prohibit respondent from enforcing his ruling, in response to which the court issued a preliminary order in prohibition. In the instant proceeding, the court made its preliminary order absolute, and ordered respondent to honor relator's demand for a jury trial, for the following reasons. First, there was no constitutional right to a bench trial in civil commitment cases. Second, sexually violent predators did not compose a suspect class for due process purposes, and relator had articulated a rational basis for allowing it the right to a nonconsensual jury trial by arguing that both relator and the detainee had a great deal at stake, and that either party should be entitled to a trial before a jury--the body traditionally regarded as most likely to provide a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Gentry County (Missouri) which affirmed the decision of respondent Director of Revenue suspending appellant's license, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.505.1, for driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of .10 percent or more by weight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was stopped for squealing his tires. During the stop, appellant failed a field sobriety test. A breathalyzer test showed appellant's blood alcohol level (BAC) to be .135 percent. Appellant was under 21 years of age at the time of the arrest. A hearing was held on the suspension of appellant's license pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.505.1 (Supp. 1996). The hearing officer rejected appellant's contention that, in order to make a prima facie case for suspension under &sect; 302.505.1, respondent Director of Revenue had the burden to prove probable cause to stop for an alcohol related offense. Instead, the hearing officer found that because appellant had a BAC of .10 percent or more, respondent director only had to show that there was probable cause to arrest. The circuit court affirmed and appellant sought further review. The court reversed and remanded because under the statute, if the driver was under 21 years of age, respondent director was required to prove that the driver was stopped upon probable cause to believe that he had committed one of the alcohol related offenses listed in the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order affirming the suspension of appellant's license was reversed and the matter was remanded to the lower court with directions to enter its judgment reinstating appellant's driver's license, because there was no showing that appellant was stopped upon probable cause to believe that he had committed an alcohol related offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, part owner and operator of an elk farm, had to destroy a part of his elk herd after several of the elk tested positive for bovine tuberculosis. Appellant disagreed with respondent, the state department of agriculture, about the actual value of the elk for indemnification purposes. The trial court entered a judgment in which it declared the actual value of the elk. The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The trial court did not err in holding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 267.610 required that the value of the elk be determined at the actual time of the appraisal. Thus, it was proper to consider that the elk were exposed to or infected with a highly infectious disease. That this could lead to designating the actual value of some of the elk as zero did not render Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 267.610 meaningless. However, the trial court erred in declaring an actual value because the proper procedure for appraisal set forth in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 267.610 was not followed. The court directed the trial court to require the parties to jointly appraise the elk, and to bring in a disinterested third party if they disagreed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part a judgment by the trial court that declared the actual value of appellant's slaughtered elk. The trial court identified the correct standard for appraising the actual value, but the trial court did not follow the correct statutory procedure when it determined the elks' value.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment granting respondent grandparents supervised visitation with appellant parents' minor child. The court rejected appellants' constitutional challenge to the grandparent visitation statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.402.2 (Cum. Supp. 1998). Initially, the court found that the Missouri Supreme Court held &sect; 452.402.2 did not violate appellants' U.S. Const. amend. XIV due process rights because it contemplated only occasional, temporal visitation, which would only be allowed if a trial court found visitation to be in the best interest of the child and would not endanger the child's physical and emotional development. Additionally, the court determined that the U.S. Supreme Court decision did not provide appellants any relief: &sect; 452.402.2 offered significant protections to parents that were not available in an unconstitutional Washington visitation statute. Also, appellants' advocacy of the strict scrutiny standard of review did not receive support from that Supreme Court case. Finally, the court determined that sufficient evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that visitation was in the child's best interests and that it would not harm her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment granting supervised visitation to respondent grandparents where the state grandparent visitation statute was constitutional because it contemplated only occasional, temporal visitation of the grandchild, which would only be allowed if a trial court found visitation to be in the best interests of the child. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that visitation was in the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's right foot was pressed on the gas pedal and his left foot was pressed on the brake pedal. Defendant admitted he had been drinking, and he was convicted of driving while intoxicated. The appellate court affirmed because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.001.1 (Cum. Supp. 1998) permitted conviction upon proof that defendant was either driving or operating the vehicle. Although defendant was not driving, he was operating the vehicle. Defendant was engaging the machinery of his vehicle and was in a position to manipulate its movement. The term &quot;operating&quot; was readily understandable by jurors, and therefore the trial court did not err in refusing to submit to the jury defendant's proposed definition of the term, which in any event did not conform to the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction because defendant's presence in the driver's seat of a running motor vehicle was sufficient to establish that he was operating the vehicle, and there was no error in refusing to submit defendant's proposed definition of &quot;operating&quot; to the jury.</SPAN></P>

First, the court held that constitutional claims raised for the first time in appellant's petition were deemed waived. The court further held that the trial court did not err in treating his petition as a civil matter, rather than a criminal matter. After the judgment and sentencing occurred, the criminal trial court had exhausted its jurisdiction. Appellant lacked the authority to invoke the jurisdiction of the criminal court, which could only have been done through the filing of criminal charges by a prosecutor.

One of the elements of an adverse possession claim was continuous possession for 10 years prior to commencement of the action to perfect title. Appellants contended that a 1975 city resolution vacated the unused tract. The trial court found the city did not vacate the tract until it passed an official ordinance and signed conveyance deeds in 1988, less that 10 years before appellants filed their action. Judgment affirmed. The 1975 resolution did not state that the city vacated and abandoned the disputed land; the resolution showed only an intention to one day transfer the land to the property owners adjacent to the dedicated tract. The 1988 ordinance properly effectuated a vacation of the dedicated land, but did not apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; appellants could not have adversely possessed a disputed piece of land prior to the date on which the city passed an ordinance vacating and abandoning the property, as the ordinance was passed less than 10 years prior to the filing of appellants' adverse possession claim.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss because appellee's motion referred to facts, documents, and information outside the face of the pleadings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment suspending defendant's license, finding that defendant was required to prove financial responsibility, and that the record of the conviction need not be expunged. Defendant had his license automatically suspended for driving while intoxicated because defendant was under the age of 21. Defendant appealed the suspension arguing that he was not afforded a proper hearing, he was not required to provide proof of financial responsibility since he was a first time offender, and was entitled to expungement of his record. The trial court agreed with the state and defendant appealed. On appeal, the court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.541.2 clearly provided that defendant was exempt from being required to file proof of financial responsibility. Furthermore, the court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.545.1 clearly provided that defendant's record of arrest should be expunged. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment suspending defendant's license but reversed the remainder of the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment finding that defendant's driver's license was properly revoked was affirmed because the procedure to suspend the license was constitutional. Nevertheless, the decision finding that defendant was required to provide proof of financial responsibility for the return of his license and could not get the record of his arrest expunged was reversed because Missouri statutes clearly provided those rights to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 198.070.11 in the Circuit Court of Boone County (Missouri).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, nursing home and administrator, were convicted of neglect of a resident under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 198.070.11 (1994). Both contended the evidence was insufficient, the trial court wrongly allowed the filing of an information in lieu of indictment that charged new offenses, the information did not sufficiently inform of the neglect charges' basis, and the trial court wrongly allowed expert testimony by an unqualified witness. Appellant nursing home also argued the indictment did not identify the high managerial agents upon whom corporate criminal liability was based and that it was an immune quasi-governmental body under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 198.012 (1994). The court affirmed. Appellant administrator understood, despite no medical training, the severe risk to patients with pressure sores, and had been warned of conditions. At most, the information changed the allegation as to the means of perpetuating the offense, not the offense. Specific references to other corporate agents were unnecessary in that their exact identity was not an element of the offense. The statute itself included a definition of neglect. Appellant nursing home was governed by directors, not the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions were affirmed. Filing of the information in lieu of indictment that referred to unspecified corporate agents and broadened the neglect complaint did not charge appellants with new offenses because the elements of the offense remained the same. Evidence of warnings to appellants was sufficient, and appellant administrator should have known of risks to patients despite his lack of medical training.</SPAN></P>

He was also convicted of attempting to manufacture a controlled substance. This conviction was based on evidence seized during a search of his motel room. Defendant claimed the affidavit upon which a search warrant was based was inadequate because it failed to state the basis of an informant's knowledge about defendant's manufacture of illegal drugs. The court did not find that the affidavit was not misleading simply because it did not include information about the informant's criminal background. The officers were validly seraching in a place where they had a right to be under there warrant. The items seized were in plain view and the search was not impermissibly broad. Defendant failed to show, as it was his burden to do, that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the motel room at the time the officer entered it without a warrant. The requisite probable cause for issuance of a warrant to the search of room existed, and the search warrant was valid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of receiving stolen property, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. Appellant moved to withdraw his guilty plea under Mo. R. Crim. P. 24.035; the trial court denied his motion because it was not filed within 90-days of his delivery to the Department of Corrections. Appellant challenged, arguing that the deadline in filing a Mo. R. Crim. P. 24.035 motion was unconstitutional because it provided no exception for late filing in instances where good cause existed. The court affirmed, holding that appellant failed to preserve the issue for appellate review. Appellant did not present his constitutional challenge to the trial court, and it was not included in his pro se motion or in his motion counsel's motion. Appellant also failed to include the issue in his pro se writ of error coram nobis, and failed to raise the issue verbally before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered a judgment dissolving the marriage of appellant father and his child's mother. The trial court found it was in the child's best interests for the parents to share joint legal custody of the child, and for appellant to be awarded primary physical custody of the child, subject to mother's right to reasonable visitation. Two months later, appellant filed a motion to modify dissolution decree due to mother's impending incarceration. Appellees, mother's parents and their spouses, moved to intervene so they could pursue visitation rights. Trial court awarded sole legal custody of child to appellant, but awarded maternal grandparents and their spouses visitation rights every other weekend. Judgment reversed. Applicable statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.402 did not expressly or impliedly authorize an award of visitation to step-grandparents. Further, the visitation ordered by the trial court exceeded a minimal intrusion into appellant's constitutionally protected fundamental right of privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a petition for incarceration reimbursement against appellant prisoner pursuant to the Missouri Incarceration Reimbursement Act (MIRA), Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.833.1 (1994). Appellant fought the claim on the basis that application of MIRA violated the constitutional provisions prohibiting ex post facto laws contained in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 and prohibiting the taking of property without due process of law contained in U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. At the time appellant committed the crimes for which he was originally sentenced, MIRA was not in effect. The court noted that MIRA did not focus on appellant's past crimes, and it was not enacted as additional punishment. Instead, MIRA's focus was on the nonpunitive objective of obtaining reimbursement for the state for its expenditures in caring for its inmates. Accordingly, the court held that appellant failed to demonstrate that application of MIRA in this case would violate his constitutional rights. The court found no merit to appellant's other arguments.</SPAN></P>

The application of Missouri Incarceration Reimbursement Act to the appellant was not a violation of the state or federal constitutional provisions prohibiting ex post facto laws because it did not focus on appellant's past crimes, and it was not enacted as additional punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a claim against respondent county drug task force, alleging wrongful arrest and incarceration under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellant's claim could not be based solely on a theory of respondeat superior. Appellant argued that despite the law's clarity on that point, his claim should have been permitted because a policy or custom of respondent as a governmental entity was responsible for the deprivation of his rights, and he should have been allowed to conduct extensive discovery to determine the policies and procedures of respondent. However, this position was not argued before the trial court, and appellant was bound to that position on appeal. Appellant could not sue a local government under &sect; 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant was charged with robbery. He pled guilty. He was sentenced to prison. He filed a motion to vacate sentence and judgment which was denied. He appealed. He alleged the trial court committed clear error in finding his plea was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. The evidence at the postconviction hearing, he said, showed his counsel caused him to believe he was pleading guilty to a lesser charge and sentence. The court affirmed denial of appellant's postconviction motion. The court also sanctioned him for filing a frivolous appeal. On rehearing, the court held it would withhold the sanction. The court held the law concerning frivolous appeals of postconviction appeals needed clarification. The court also held that if counsel had a case which had no nonfrivolous points of appeal, counsel was directed to file a summary of the case without arguing against the client and then seek leave to withdraw.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment denying criminal appellant's postconviction motion to vacate sentence and judgment affirmed, but relief from sanction granted because appeal of appellant was frivolous as it had no chance of success but sanction relief was warranted since confusion had existed on proper procedure to follow concerning frivolous appeals of postconviction motions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was denied general relief benefits because she was living with relatives who provided her with food, shelter, and other necessities of life. The court concluded that the Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 208.015.5 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because appellant was not a member of a suspect class and the guidelines and limitations were rationally related to the legitimate state interest in maximizing limited public assistance resources to those most in need. Appellant was a member of her relatives' household because she was dependent upon them, they subsisted together as a unit, and her legal status as an emancipated adult was irrelevant to the inquiry of whether sufficient resources were available to her. Since the household income was more than sufficient to support appellant and no other reason prevented her from availing herself of that resource, she was ineligible for general relief benefits.</SPAN></P>

The court determined as an initial matter that it had jurisdiction to hear the case, despite Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3, because appellant's claim was merely colorable, as opposed to substantial. The court then affirmed, holding that &sect; 302.312 was not facially a &quot;special law&quot; based on the immutable characteristic of constitutional status in contravention of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 40(4), 40(30), 42, as contended by appellant, because neither the Bureau of Vital Records nor its parent Department of Health was mentioned in the Missouri Constitution.</SPAN></P>

First, in enacting the location restrictions, plaintiff relied on evidence (in the form of studies from other jurisdictions) of adverse secondary effects of adult oriented businesses or sexually oriented businesses, which plaintiff reasonably believed to be relevant to its problems. Thus, the ordinances were content-neutral and were designed to serve a substantial government interest. Second, exact identity was not required between the types of businesses studied by plaintiff and defendant's adult business.

Further, the order did not result in any fundamental unfairness, since any statements defendant wished to make about his whereabouts at the time of the robbery were actually made.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found that appellee employee suffered personal injuries during the course of his employment with appellant employer, a railway company. Appellant was found responsible under the Federal Employer's Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 51 et seq. Appellant then sought review of the judgment alleging numerous errors including error in: (1) denial of its directed verdict motion, (2) sanctioning appellant by prohibiting it from using deposition testimony for impeachment, (3) admission of certain evidence, (4) failing to find the verdict against the weight of the evidence, (5) violating due process, and (6) refusing to permit certain evidence. On appeal, all allegations of error were found to be without merit. Further, under Mo. R. Civ. P. 56.01, appellant was not found to have &quot;seasonably&quot; amended its answer to the interrogatory to properly include the existence of impeaching videotapes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court was affirmed, because the allegations of error were without merit. Further, the jury verdict was upheld because there was not a &quot;complete absence&quot; of probative facts to support the finding of negligence and causation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a motion to modify decree of dissolution requesting legal and primary physical custody of the children. The trial court appointed a guardian ad litem for the two children, and subsequently appellant filed a motion to disqualify and remove the guardian ad litem, which the trial court denied. On appeal, appellant argued the trial court erred in denying his motion because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.423 (1998) expressly granted any party an entitlement to an automatic disqualification of a guardian ad litem upon request and without discretion of the trial court. The court found that the trial court denied the motion by declaring unconstitutional the provision of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.423.1 (1998). Thus, because the basis of the trial court's ruling was a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute, the Missouri Supreme Court had exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, appellant claimed that he was denied due process of law when the trial court did not allow him to challenge the allegedly unconstitutional revocation of his drivers license beyond the statutory limits provided by the law. The court dismissed the appeal because the court lacked appellate jurisdiction. The trial court's decision was not in writing or signed by the judge; thus, it was not an appealable judgment under Mo.

The trial court ruled in favor of plaintiff on his fraud claims, but in favor of defendants on the other claims. One of the issues appealed was the trial court's granting of summary judgment to defendant hospital based on immunity under the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (HCQIA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11101 et seq. The court found that the Missouri supreme court had exclusive appellate jurisdiction under Mo. Const. art.

Social services concluded appellant's name should be permanently placed on an Employee Disqualification List, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 660.315.

The court found that the testimony of several witnesses overwhelmingly supported that determination, and that it was within social service's discretion to weigh testimony. Appellant also raised constitutional claims. However, constitutional issues not raised at the first opportunity were deemed waived.
