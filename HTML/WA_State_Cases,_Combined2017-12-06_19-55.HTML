Code &sect; 9A.44.030(2) affirmative defense of reasonable belief that the victim was at least 14 years old or less than 36 months younger than the defendant based on the victim's declaration as to age when, in response to the defendant's comment that she appeared too young to be drinking, she responded, &quot;I get that a lot,&quot; because the declaration did not say anything about any specific ages; [2]-The youthfulness of an offender more than 18 years old can be a mitigating factor justifying a sentence below the standard sentencing range if there is some evidence that the offender's youthfulness in fact impaired the offender's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

R. App. P. 12.2 because the motion was subject to a statutory time bar and the trial court's power to entertain postjudgment motions extended only to motions that did not challenge issues already decided by an appellate court; [3]-Defendant could not avoid the time bar on the basis of newly discovered evidence because he did not demonstrate reasonable diligence in seeking relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner sought to withdraw his guilty pleas, claiming that he should technically have been sentenced to 408 years with a possible extension to life in prison rather than to a determinate 408-year sentence. The reviewing court held that the petitioner's plea bargain did not bar him from raising a collateral challenge to his plea of guilty because the language of the plea agreement did not impose such a prohibition. The court also held that the petition was not time barred under Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police detective read text messages on a cell phone that was seized from a person who had been arrested for possession of heroin.

The defendant was consequently arrested and charged with attempted possession of heroin. The defendant contended that the detective's conduct violated his rights under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and U.S. Const. amend. IV.

In accordance with &sect; 10.58.090(1), the trial court admitted evidence that defendant had committed other similar crimes against another alleged juvenile victim. The Washington Supreme Court subsequently held that &sect; 10.58.090, which made an exception to the inadmissibility of prior bad acts evidence under Rule 404(b) for evidence of sex offenses, was unconstitutional. The supreme court in the present case held that the intermediate appellate court erred in holding that the error in admitting the prior sexual offense evidence under &sect; 10.58.090 was harmless based on State v. Read, in which the supreme court held that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, an appellate court presumes the judge in a bench trial does not consider inadmissible evidence in rendering a verdict. The supreme court held that the error was not harmless because credibility was a primary issue in the case and testimony regarding the prior sex offense featured prominently at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington certified to the Washington Supreme Court two questions concerning the validity of the provision of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.040(11) excluding religious nonprofit organizations from the definition of &quot;employer&quot; for purposes of the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 49.60.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee who was discharged by defendant employer, a nonprofit religious organization, after he suffered a stroke that left him partially impaired sought relief in state court, alleging employment discrimination in violation of federal law and the WLAD. The employer removed the case to federal court and sought dismissal of the WLAD claim. The federal court asked the Washington Supreme Court to rule on the validity of &sect; 49.60.040(11). By plurality opinions, the Supreme Court held that &sect; 49.60.040(11) is not facially invalid under the privileges and immunities clause of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, because it does not grant a privilege or immunity and reasonable grounds exist for distinguishing between religious nonprofits and other nonprofits, or under the establishment clause of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, because it does not constitute &quot;support&quot; for religious establishments in that no public money or property is involved and any financial benefit is only indirect. The court further held, however, that the provision is unconstitutional as applied to the employee because the exemption was unnecessary to alleviate a concrete and substantial burden on religious exercise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington Supreme Court answered the first question in the negative, holding that &sect; 49.60.040(11) is not facially unconstitutional, but answered the second question in the affirmative, holding that &sect; 49.60.040(11) is unconstitutional as applied to the employee's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The medical malpractice claimant sought damages from the public hospital, alleging he was taken off an anticoagulant medication, which led to swelling in his left leg that was diagnosed as deep venous thrombosis.

The trial court denied the motion. In a plurality opinion, the reviewing court held that the pre suit notice requirement of former &sect; 7.70.100(1) was valid as applied to the hospital, which was an agency of the State, because it constituted a valid exercise of legislative authority under Wash. Const. art.

Further, the prisoner had a cognizable liberty interest in release and was entitled to due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, which was satisfied because he had a parolability hearing before the board and received written reasons for the governor's decision. Moreover, the governor did not abuse her discretion in canceling parole because she considered all the evidence presented to the board, and she supported her decision that the prisoner was not rehabilitated and posed an unreasonable risk to public safety with objective facts. Further, the prisoner's First Amendment rights were not violated by the governor's referencing letters that the prisoner wrote to the board because the governor's cancellation of parole advanced the legitimate penological goal of not releasing an unrehabilitated offender. Finally, the board did not abuse its discretion in adding 36 months to the prisoner's minimum term under Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A total of 22 continuances were granted, which caused the defendant's trial to be delayed for 23 months. The Washington Supreme Court held that the delay did not violate the defendant's speedy trial rights because the defendant's own counsel requested the continuances causing the delay and no claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was made in relation to those continuances. The delay was attributable to the defendant because his counsel acted as his agent when seeking the continuances to further the defense, and the defendant's objections to those acts did not weigh in favor of finding a violation of constitutional speedy trial rights. The court further held that probable cause for the search warrant was sufficiently established by qualifying information in the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant application and that no violation of the warrant presentation requirement of Wash.

The organization appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellate court held that the qualified executive communications privilege under Wash. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 could served as an exemption to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.56.070(1) because the Public Records Act could not override the constitutional delegation of power to the governor. Further, the trial court properly determined that the qualified executive communications privilege covered the documents at issue because the communications concerned policy matters and were authored or solicited and received by the governor or senior advisors who had broad discretion over policy matters, and the organization refused to make any type of showing of need that would require the court to determine whether its interest in obtaining the documents outweighed the public interest in the governor's access to candid advice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of indecent liberties and second degree rape. After defendant's motion for a new trial was denied, he appealed the guilty verdicts and certain community custody conditions. The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed the second degree rape conviction but reversed the indecent liberties conviction. Defendant sought review by the supreme court to address the errors assigned to his second degree rape conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant objected to the consent instruction on the grounds that he had the right to control his defense and because he did not want to bear the burden of proving consent. Defendant attempted to cast doubt on the element of forcible compulsion. The trial court violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to control his defense by instructing the jury on the affirmative defense of consent over defendant's objections. By imposing a defense on an unwilling defendant, the trial court impinged defendant's autonomy to conduct his defense. In addition, instructing the jury that defendant had the burden of proving consent was inconsistent with defendant's trial strategy of casting doubt on the element of forcible compulsion. The consent instruction imposed a burden on defendant that was greater than the burden necessary to create a reasonable doubt about the element of forcible compulsion. Further, although the instruction regarding the State's burden was accurate, that did not prove that the consent instruction was harmless. Thus, the State failed to prove that instructing the jury on the affirmative defense over defendant's objections was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent State and a regional transit authority (Sound Transit) entered an agreement to lease a portion of a multilane state highway to Sound Transit for light rail. As consideration, Sound Transit agreed to pay an amount equal to the State's contribution to construct the center lanes and the value of a 40 year lease. Sound Transit also agreed to advance the cost of replacing the center two lanes, credited toward its lease. The reviewing court held that the agreement did not violate the constitutional provision because the agreed plan did not result in a net loss of lanes; the plan did not require an appropriation from the state motor vehicle fund; the constitutional provision, while protecting certain taxes and revenues from uses other than highway purposes, did not protect the highways themselves, and the State will be reimbursed for all motor vehicle funds that were used to construct the center lanes. The court further held that the agreement did not violate the statutory provision because the State had the discretion to determine that the two center lanes were no longer needed for highway purposes and properly did so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2000, defendant was convicted of first degree murder and unlawful possession of a firearm. In June 2009, the trial court resentenced him. In October 2009, he filed a second personal restraint petition (PRP), arguing that his counsel was ineffective in failing to inform him of a second degree murder plea offer. The Washington Court of Appeals dismissed his second PRP as untimely and successive. The supreme court granted discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because his petition was filed within one year of his resentencing, defendant claimed his petition was timely under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090. The time bar could be avoided if defendant could establish one of six exceptions listed under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.100. However, defendant did not argue that his ineffective assistance claims fit one of those enumerated exceptions. Instead, he relied on the language in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090 that provided that a judgment had to be valid on its face in order for the time bar to apply. The facial invalidity in defendant's judgment and sentence did not waive the time bar for his ineffectiveness of counsel claim. His ineffectiveness claims were time barred because they did not fit within any of the exceptions listed in Wash. Rev. Code ch. 10.73. Because defendant did not appeal his judgment and sentence, his judgment became final on the date when the trial court clerk filed the judgment in 2000. Although a sentencing error was found in defendant's judgment and sentence, that error was corrected and defendant's remedy was limited to correcting the sentencing error. Thus, the dismissal of defendant's PRP as untimely was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the PRP as untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Washington Department of Ecology issued an administrative order to respondent cattle rancher directing him to take several steps to curb pollution of a creek running on his property.

The Columbia County Superior Court, Washington, reversed the summary judgment determination and invalidated the administrative order. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court held that the Department did not exceed its authority under the Washington Water Pollution Control Act when it ordered the rancher to comply with regulations concerning nonpoint source pollutant discharge into the creek. The Department was authorized to regulate nonpoint source pollution, and there was no evidence suggesting that it otherwise contravened statutory provisions prohibiting impairment of water rights and conversion of agricultural land. The rancher failed to meet his burden of proof under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.05.570(1)(a) that the administrative order was invalid. The administrative order was supported by substantial evidence. The record demonstrated that the cattle had much more than occasional access to the creek. The administrative order did not effect an unconstitutional taking. The rancher failed to prove that he suffered any economic loss, let alone an economic loss that constituted a taking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court reversed the trial court on all counts, reinstated the Board's summary judgment order and the underlying administrative order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was black, was charged with and convicted of one count of first degree felony murder and three counts of second degree assault. During jury selection, the prosecution used a peremptory challenge to strike the only black juror in the venire. This challenge came after the prosecution questioned the juror extensively during voir dire--far more extensively than any other juror. In a lead opinion signed by two justices and in three separate concurring opinions signed by six other justices, the Supreme Court decided that the trial court did not commit clear error by finding that, under the Batson analysis, the State's exercise of the peremptory challenge did not constitute purposeful discrimination in violation of the defendant's Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws because the recent murder of the juror's friend provided a legitimate, race-neutral reason for striking the juror. Several members of the court also criticized the Batson analysis requirement of proving purposeful discrimination to establish an equal protection violation but the court did not agree that this case provided a basis to reconsider the Batson rule.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that evidence of the crimes was obtained in violation of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and that he was placed in double jeopardy by the rape convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers randomly viewing the guest registry of a motel found the defendant's name and determined that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest. The officers went to the defendant's room and arrested him. Through the open door of the defendant's room, the officers observed an injured and bloodied female. After entering the room to render aid, they discovered a second female in the room who said she had been raped by the defendant. Based on statements by the second female, more evidence was discovered in a dumpster in the motel parking lot. The defendant argued that all of the evidence obtained after his arrest, including the victims' testimony, should have been suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful motel guest registry search. The lead opinion by the reviewing court held that the officers' warrantless search of the motel room was justified under the emergency aid or &quot;save life&quot; community caretaking exception to the constitutional warrant requirement and that all evidence in plain view and the victims' testimony was admissible at trial. The court further held that the rape convictions did not constitute the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that the trial court correctly determined that the impound was proper because under Wash. Rev.

Moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion to suppress under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.6 because the record supported the officer's decision to impound, he followed all standard procedures, and an e-mail written by the officer did not show that the search was pretextual.

Code &sect; 9.94A.535,.589 before running sentences consecutively. The Washington Court of Appeals dismissed the petition. The petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under a plea agreement, most of the defendant's sentences would run concurrently. However, the State indicated it would ask the judge to run a sentence for delivery of a controlled substance conviction consecutive to the others. Neither the State nor the defendant nor the trial court realized that the consecutive sentence would constitute an exceptional sentence and require special findings. The trial judge accepted the pleas and largely accepted the State's sentencing recommendation without making any special findings. The supreme court held that the defendant was required to show that he was prejudiced by the error to obtain relief under &sect; 10.73.090. Moreover, the defendant did not show that he suffered actual and substantial prejudice from the trial judge's failure to make the specific findings required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.94A.535,.589 before entering consecutive sentences on current offenses, because while the sentence violated such procedural requirements, the sentence was within the trial court's power to issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who admitted to police that he forged and cashed a check he stole from his corporate employer, argued that the trial court erred by convicting him of identity theft because the corporation did not qualify as a &quot;person&quot; under the identity theft statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.35.020, or, in the alternative, that the identity theft statute was unconstitutionally vague. The reviewing court held that, because the statutory definition of &quot;person&quot; in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.110(17), which Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.35.005(4) incorporated by reference, included corporations, theft of a corporate identity was a crime under &sect; 9.35.020. The rule of lenity did not apply because the &quot;living or dead&quot; language of the identity theft statute had to be interpreted to describe corporations as well as natural persons in light of the legislative history of the statute. The reviewing court also held that the identity theft statute was not void for vagueness because it provided fair warning that theft of a corporate identity could be punished as a crime and because it provided sufficiently objective standards for purposes of enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the pendency of a will contest involving the estate, the legislature amended the abuser statutes (Wash.

In light of the amendment, the administrator filed the petition. The supreme court held that the abuser statutes acted prospectively as applied to the wife, as the triggering event was her attempt to receive property or any other benefit from the decedent's estate, and prior to probate, the wife's interest was not vested for purposes of determining retroactivity. Moreover, applying the abuser statutes would not violate the ex post facto clause under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Wash. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, a group of organizations, legislators, and taxpayers, sought a declaratory judgment that the tax-increase provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.135.034 (2011) (Initiative 1053) violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 22 and art. II, &sect; 1(b). The King County Superior Court, Washington, granted the group's motion for summary judgment. Appellant State of Washington sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 43.135.034 had two provisions, one requiring that any bill containing a tax increase be passed by a two-thirds majority vote of the legislature (Supermajority Requirement), and the second requiring that any tax bill increasing spending beyond the state spending limit be approved by the voters (Referendum Requirement). The court held that the constitutionality of the Supermajority Requirement under art. II, &sect; 22 was justiciable under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.24.020 because the requirement nullified the legislators' votes by preventing the passage of tax legislation that received a simple majority vote; however, the constitutionality of the Referendum Requirement under Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 1(b) was not justiciable because of the hypothetical nature of the claim and lack of injury. The Supermajority Requirement was unconstitutional because it violated art. II, &sect; 22, which required that bills receive only a majority vote. Finally, the Supermajority Requirement was severable from the Referendum Requirement because the complete text of Initiative 1053 contained a severability clause and the Referendum Requirement served the voters' intent even absent the Supermajority Requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision regarding the justiciability and constitutionality of the Supermajority Requirement, reversed the trial court's decision that the Referendum Requirement presented a justiciable controversy, and declined to reach the merits of the Referendum Requirement's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that a cautionary instruction on cross-racial identification was not required by due process of law in this case because other procedural safeguards were available and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to give such an instruction because the victim's identification was based on general physique, apparel, and sunglasses and not on facial features, specific physical characteristics, or merely the fact that defendant was African American. The supreme court further held that the true threat requirement of felony harassment was not an essential element under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.020(2)(b) and was not required to be included in the information or &quot;to convict&quot; instruction, and that the prosecutor's comments in closing argument about the testifying victim did not constitute misconduct because they were based on the evidence introduced at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence and driving while license revoked in the first degree. The Washington Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's findings of fact from the suppression hearing but disagreed with the trial court's resulting conclusion that the traffic stop was constitutional. The State petitioned for review of that purely legal issue, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer admitted that he was motivated to conduct the traffic stop primarily to detect further signs of driving under the influence (DUI). The trial court found that defendant's exhaust infraction was an actual reason for the stop and also that the officer would have stopped defendant for the exhaust infraction even without the previous DUI report. Thus, defendant's stop was a mixed-motive stop. Because the officer had a reasonable articulable suspicion that defendant was violating Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.37.390 based on an altered exhaust and decided that a traffic stop was reasonably necessary to address that suspected traffic infraction and to promote traffic safety and the general welfare, the fact that the officer was also interested in and motivated by a related DUI investigation was irrelevant, even if that investigation could not provide a legal basis for the traffic stop. Because the suspected traffic infraction was an actual, conscious, and independent cause of the traffic stop, the trial court was correct in concluding that the stop was not pretextual. Thus, the officer's traffic stop did not violate Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the court of appeals and upheld the trial court's conclusion that the traffic stop was constitutional. Defendant's conviction was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington Court of Appeals held that the 2009 appropriation in former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.09.170(4) (2009) was a refund within the meaning of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 40. Petitioner alliance filed a petition for discretionary review challenging only whether the 2009 appropriation was constitutional. The State raised a preliminary issue of whether the issue was moot. The supreme court granted review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 40 required that all motor vehicle fuel tax revenues and licensing fees be spent on highway purposes and provided that refunds authorized by law for taxes paid on motor vehicle fuels was a highway purpose. For many years, the legislature refunded one percent of the motor vehicle fuel tax revenues to nonhighway recreational users. The challenged action arose in 2009 when the legislature appropriated the excess fund balance from one account for the benefit of the Washington Parks and Recreation Commission. Five judges agreed that the appeal was moot, but three of those judges decided that the case presented issues of continuing and substantial public interest. Those three judges found that, while the 2009 appropriation stretched the statutory refund to its constitutional limits, the legislative finding of a benefit to affected taxpayers in addition to the ample evidence in the record supported upholding the appropriation. But, four judges disagreed with the lead opinion's holding as the purported benefit of paying park employees from funds dedicated to auto gas taxes had no connection to the constitutional limit on use of such a gas tax for public roads.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 9.94A.500(1) and 9.94A.530(2), were unconstitutional insofar as they permitted a sentencing court to make a finding of criminal history based solely on a prosecutor summary and the defendant's failure to object.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that 2008 amendments to Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.94A.500(1) and 9.94A.530(2) violated defendant's due process rights by shifting the State's burden to prove prior convictions at sentencing. The State in this case could have established defendant's prior convictions through certified copies of the judgment and sentences or other comparable documents. The Washington Constitution did not allow the court to relieve the State of its failure to prove prior convictions simply because defendant failed to object. In other words, it violated due process to base defendant's sentence on the prosecutor's bare assertions or allegations of prior convictions. The 2008 amendment to &sect; 9.94A.500(1) was not unconstitutional on its face, but rather as applied to defendant's case.

The insurer was afforded notice, intervened, and participated in a lengthy and highly contested hearing on the issue of the reasonableness.

Under the risk of loss approach, the CLA was plainly debt because the city's taxpayers bore the risk of project failure. If the regional center were to fail, then the city would be required to make loans to service appellant's bonds with no foreseeable means for the loans ever to be repaid. The obligation to make loans was absolute, so the city would have to come up with money either from the general fund or increased taxes, potentially endangering basic city services. However, the bondholders carried no risk of loss. Assuming the city fulfilled its obligation, all debt service payments would be timely made. There could be no doubt that, under the risk of loss approach, the city's obligation under the CLA constituted debt for purposes of Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6. Furthermore, because the debt under the CLA constituted more than one and one-half percent of the total assessed value of all taxable property within the city, it exceeded the city's nonvoted debt limit under Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The King County Superior Court (Washington) found appellant estates' failure to include the assets in the qualified terminable interest property trust as part of the state taxable estate to be an impermissible deduction. The first estate paid the state estate tax owed and appealed directly to the supreme court. The second estate filed an appeal with a court of appeals. The supreme court granted direct review and consolidated the two cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased husbands' established marital trusts in their wills, naming their wives as lifetime beneficiaries. The personal representatives of the deceased husbands' estates made the election required by I.R.C. &sect; 2056(b)(7) for federal estate tax deferral, thereby subjecting the surviving wives' estates to later federal taxation in light of those recognized rationales of notice, election, benefit, and consistency. The personal representatives made no state election. No state election existed. Individuals who elected qualified terminable interest property treatment for federal tax purposes before May 17, 2005, assumed the risk of what future changes in federal tax law might mean for the deferral. They did not invite or assume the risk of a state reaching into the grave and taxing a transfer 25 years after the fact. Respondent, the Washington State Department of Revenue, exceeded its authority in enacting regulations that allowed it to treat transfers completed by the deceased husbands years ago as if the estates had elected to defer state estate tax on the transfers, to be paid by their wives' estates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that allowing respondent's negligent retention and negligent supervision claims to go forward would violate the church's First Amendment right to select and supervise its ministers and its First Amendment right, as part of a hierarchical religious organization, to deference to decisions made by its ecclesiastical tribunals. The church's own investigation and decision involved consideration of spiritual standards, religious doctrine, and the church's policies and practices. Because religious organizations have the First Amendment right to select and supervise their clergy in accord with their religious beliefs and doctrines, respondent's claims of negligent supervision and retention were foreclosed as a matter of law, and the appellate court erred in concluding otherwise. Respondent's negligent retention and supervision claims were also foreclosed on the ground that the dispute had been decided by the church's governing body for the region, and respondent declined to appeal from that decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants brought a state constitutional challenge, alleging that the hazardous substances tax in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.21.030 violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 40. The King County Superior Court (Washington) granted summary judgment to the State holding that appellants' claim was time barred under the Washington Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act and that the tax did not violate art. II, &sect; 40. Appellants challenged the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reasonable time and laches doctrines could not be used as affirmative defenses to bar a constitutional challenge. Thus, appellants' constitutional challenge should not have been barred by the failure to bring the action in a reasonable time or because of laches. Because the hazardous substances tax statute in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.21.030 was enacted to tax toxic substances, including motor vehicle fuel, for the purpose of cleaning up spills of hazardous substances, the funds from the tax levied against motor vehicle fuel did not have to be used for highway purposes as they were never restricted to be used only for highway purposes. Also, even if the hazardous substances tax was a tax on the sale, distribution or use of motor vehicle fuel, funds from the tax levied against motor vehicle fuel were not restricted to use for highway purposes and were never intended to be used for highway purposes. Thus, the hazardous substances tax was constitutional because the common and ordinary meaning of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 40 did not bar the implementation of a new tax for the purpose of cleaning up hazardous substances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the trial court's judgment holding that the doctrines of reasonable time or laches barred the present lawsuit, but affirmed the trial court's judgment granting summary judgment to the State because the common and ordinary meaning of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 40 did not preclude the enactment of an additional tax on motor vehicle fuel for hazardous substances cleanup.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first question asked whether a trial court, if awarding statutory damages under the civil remedies provision of the FLCA, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.30.170(2), must award $ 500 per plaintiff per violation. The second question asked whether requiring a trial court to award $ 500 per plaintiff per violation violates due process or public policy. The third question asked whether the FLCA provides for awarding statutory damages to persons who have not been shown to have been aggrieved by a particular violation. Regarding the first question, the Washington Supreme Court held that a court choosing to award statutory damages under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.30.170(2) must award statutory damages of $ 500 per plaintiff per violation. Regarding the second question, the Washington Supreme Court held that no state public policy or due process principles require reduction in the total damages mandated by statute. Because the Washington Supreme Court's standing jurisprudence tracks that of the United States Supreme Court, it left to the Ninth Circuit to answer the third question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence at defendant's second sentencing hearing was sufficient to uphold the jury's finding that leniency was not merited because despite the decline in defendant's mental health, no mental health professional opined that defendant was mentally retarded, and significant expert testimony tended to show that defendant's diminished mental capacity did not cause him to commit the murder. The jury could have rationally determined that given the calculated, heinous nature of the crime, mental slowness and a difficult childhood did not warrant leniency. Defendant's death sentence was proportionate because the record showed that the crime was brutal and cruel, as defendant broke down the door of a 65-year-old woman's home, raped her, strangled her, and left her to asphyxiate, while her disabled husband was downstairs, unable to resist or react; defendant then stole the woman's wedding ring, cigarettes, and items from her refrigerator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Grays Harbor County Superior Court (Washington) dismissed appellant trade association's amended complaint challenging the constitutionality of disbursements respondent State gave to Indian tribes under fuel tax compacts. The trial court found that the association failed to join indispensable parties, namely, the Indian tribes party to the agreements, under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 19. The association petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association argued the tribes were not necessary parties under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 19(a). The supreme court noted that Rule 19 focused on whether a party claimed a protected interest, not whether it actually had one. As a practical matter, the tribes' bargained-for-contractual interest in receiving payments was at risk should the association prevail. That was all that was required to make their presence necessary. The State could not adequately represent the tribes where, unlike the federal government, the State had no claim to a special trust relationship with the Indian tribes. Because there was no waiver of sovereign immunity, the tribes' joinder was not feasible. The extent of prejudice to the tribes may be significant. The circumstances in the case raised constitutional questions about governmental conduct and implicated the absentee's contractual interests. The public interest in having the constitutionality of executive conduct addressed was paramount.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err by allowing expert testimony regarding the risk factors for child abduction. The expert had 17 years of experience in the field of child abduction and his testimony helped the court make a determination of whether the father's conduct could have an adverse effect on the children's best interests. The father's constitutional rights as a parent were not violated, because the travel restrictions complied with &sect; 26.09.191(3) and served the best interests of the children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a nonprofit corporation and an individual, filed an action against respondent State, challenging Initiative 1183 (I-1183). The Cowlitz County Superior Court, Washington, granted the State's motion for summary judgment. Direct review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">I-1183 removed the State from the business of distributing and selling spirits and wine, imposed sales-based fees on private liquor distributors and retailers, and provided a distribution of $10 million per year to local governments for the purpose of enhancing public safety programs. The court concluded that appellants did not overcome the presumption that I-1183 met the single-subject and subject-in-title rules under Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. The public safety earmark was germane to the general topic of I-1183. The court found a rational unity between liquor regulation and public safety. I-1183's policy changes did not constitute a different subject from the rest of the initiative. Although appellants argued that &quot;license fees based on sales&quot; listed in the ballot title were actually taxes and that I-1183 violated the subject-in-title rule because the title did not notify voters that the charges imposed were taxes, the ballot title provided voters with adequate notice of the scope and purpose of the license fees. The phrase &quot;license fees based on sales&quot; was sufficient to indicate to an inquiring mind the scope and purpose of that provision of I-1183.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied an evidentiary hearing to determine his eligibility for unconditional discharge or conditional release to a less restrictive alternative, and the appellate court denied petitioner's motion for discretionary review. The supreme court affirmed, holding that petitioner had neither a statutory nor constitutional right to an evidentiary hearing because he did not present prima facie evidence that his condition had changed such that he no longer met the criteria for confinement. In addition, on their face and as applied to petitioner, the challenged amendments to &sect; 71.09.090 did not violate substantive due process, procedural due process, or separation of powers principles.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was told repeatedly by the social workers she needed cognitive behavior therapy, she was told repeatedly that her parental rights could be terminated if she did not do it, she was repeatedly referred to providers, and she chose not to undergo it. The judge heard the evidence from both sides and specifically concluded that necessary services had been understandably, expressly, and repeatedly offered as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.180(1)(d). Also, while there was certainly evidence in the record that the mother was often a loving and attentive mother, there was also substantial evidence that she suffered from deep deficiencies that had not improved in the five years since the case began and showed little likelihood of being remedied in the near future pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.180(1)(e). Thus, the State proved that termination of the mother's parental rights was proper. Finally, the children of parents subject to dependency and termination proceedings had due process rights that had to sometimes be protected by appointment of counsel, and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.100(6) was constitutionally adequate to protect that right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

In order to prove that a defendant rendered criminal assistance by use of deception, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.050(4), the State was required to show that defendant made some affirmative act or statement. There was no evidence that defendant did more than falsely deny knowledge of the identities of the assailants who had shot him and shot and killed his companion. Defendant's mere false disavowal of knowledge was insufficient to support his conviction. The evidence the State relied upon to show prevention or obstruction was testimony from a detective that it would have been &quot;helpful&quot; and that the investigation would have been able to take a different turn if defendant had told him who was the shooter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 89.08.400(2) did not bar the residents' challenge to the ordinance. The residents argued that the ordinance was invalid on both statutory and constitutional grounds. The supreme court found that under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 89.08.400(3), a per acre rate of $0.00 implied that a District's activities conferred no benefit on the land in that classification. A classification with a per acre rate of $0.00 would not be a suitable classification for lands that did benefit from a District's activities. The statute directed counties to determine an annual per acre rate of assessment for each classification of land in order to apportion the burden of the special assessment according to benefits conferred by the District's activities. The District's interpretation eliminated the proportionality that the legislature sought to achieve between the amount of the special assessment and the benefits conferred by the district's activities. The ordinance was invalid. The residents were entitled to the recovery of money paid under protest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not advance any argument that historical or contemporary practice demonstrated that imposition of a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof violated the Due Process Clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington Court of Appeals held that the Pierce County Superior Court had subject matter jurisdiction over respondent gaming company's petition for judicial review.

The State's petition for review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed its petition for judicial review in the Pierce County Superior Court, which transferred the case to the Thurston County Superior Court. The Supreme Court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46.095 establishes the proper venue for judicial review of cases involving a gambling commission ruling in Thurston County. The Supreme Court found that the gaming company met its burden of showing the gambling commission erred in concluding that a video interactive display (VIP) machine violated its regulations. If a player were to win more than $20 on a VIP machine, the machine would direct the player to an employee of the gaming establishment to receive cash, food, drink, or merchandise, and a player who stopped playing could similarly immediately receive cash or the credits to make purchases from the establishment. While an extra step was required to convert the cash card to cash, the step was de minimis. Because the cash card could be immediately converted into cash currency, it was functionally equivalent to cash.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled in petitioner one's case that evidence of prior acts was admissible. The trial court ruled in petitioner two's case that evidence of his prior conviction was admissible under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.58.090. The Court of Appeals (Washington) affirmed both convictions. Petitioners sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both petitioners were charged with child molestation. On appeal, the court affirmed as to petitioner one and reversed as to petitioner two. Regarding petitioner one, the trial court admitted evidence of his molestation of other girls as evidence of a common scheme or plan under Wash. R. Evid. 404(b), after finding that the alleged prior offenses occurred and exhibited markedly similar conduct. Although the trial court failed in giving a limiting instruction in this regard, the error was harmless. Regarding petitioner two, the admission of his prior sexual misconduct was not harmless error because there was a probability that absent the highly prejudicial evidence of the prior offense, the jury's verdict would have been materially affected. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.58.090 could not be harmonized with Wash. R. Evid. 404(b). The statute made evidence of prior sex offenses admissible for the purpose of showing a defendant's character. The statute made admissible what Wash. R. Evid. 404(b) declared to be inadmissible. The statute was thus an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine and the court declared it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a petition for declaratory judgment, alleging that the State was violating Wash. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, by failing to adequately fund the K-12 school system. Finding the State to be out of compliance with its constitutional duty, the King County Superior Court, Washington, entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs. It concluded that state funding was not ample, was not stable, and was not dependable. Direct review was accepted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the State had not complied with its duty under Wash. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, to make ample provision for the education of all children in Washington. As the State phased in performance-based reforms, it became increasingly apparent that the old funding formulas were no longer valid. The formulas did not correlate to the real cost of amply providing students with the constitutionally required &quot;education.&quot; As a result, the State had consistently failed to provide adequate funding for the program of basic education, including funding for essential operational costs such as utilities and transportation. To fill this gap in funding, local districts had been forced to turn increasingly to excess levies. The legislature was directed to develop a basic education program geared toward delivering the constitutionally required education and to fully fund that program through regular and dependable tax sources. The court indicated it would defer to the legislature's chosen means of discharging its duty under art. IX, &sect; 1. However, the judiciary would retain jurisdiction over the case to help ensure progress in the State's plan to fully implement education reforms by 2018.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate had pleaded guilty to three crimes. He filed a personal restraint petition, alleging that his judgment was invalid and he should be allowed to withdraw his plea. The Court of Appeals (Washington) dismissed the petition. The court granted petitioner's motion for review as to whether the judgment and sentence were facially invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fourteen years after his conviction, petitioner claimed that the judgment was invalid on its face because it misstated the maximum sentence on one of the charges. The appellate court dismissed the petition. On review, the court denied the petition and remanded to the trial court to correct the error in the judgment and sentence. The court held that the exception for facially invalid judgments could not be used to circumvent the one-year time bar under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090 to personal restraint petitions relating to fair trial issues. An argument that a judgment was invalid on its face could not be used to make an end run around the time limit. The court could examine a plea statement to evaluate a claim that a judgment was invalid on its face, but not the other way around. Petitioner was correct that his judgment and sentence contained an error. However, not every error rendered a judgment and sentence invalid, and in this case, petitioner was sentenced within the standard range of possible sentences. Thus, the trial court did not exceed its authority, the judgment and sentence were not facially invalid, and the petition was time-barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The King County Superior Court, Washington, denied petitioner inmate's motion for summary judgment, arguing that his actions did not constitute a recent overt act to qualify him for commitment proceedings under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(10) (2006), recodified as Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(12). The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed. The inmate petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the statements made by the inmate at the King County Sheriff's Office had to be evaluated in the context of his actions, his history, and his mental condition. A reasonable jury could find that the inmate committed a &quot;threat&quot; in 2006 where he explicitly described to the detective his specific plan to molest boys and have intercourse with a child. Former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.030(5) was not overbroad because it did not implicate U.S. Const. amend. I concerns. Former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(10) defined &quot;recent overt act&quot; with sufficient definiteness and provided an ascertainable standard to protect against arbitrary enforcement. Former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.030(5) satisfied the due process requirement that the State show an offender was presently dangerous before he or she was involuntarily committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted petitioner of violating a county noise ordinance, Snohomish County, Wash., Code &sect; 10.01.040(1)(d), barring the sounding of a car horn for purposes other than public safety. The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction. Petitioner filed a petition for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded the horn ordinance was overbroad. The ordinance was substantially overbroad, not only in an absolute sense, but also relative to its plainly legitimate sweep. The ordinance prohibited a wide swath of expressive conduct in order to protect against a narrow category of public disturbances. The court could not place a sufficiently limiting construction on the standardless sweep of the legislation. The language of the ordinance provided no basis for a sufficiently limiting construction to avoid an overbreadth problem. Its exceptions for public safety and officially sanctioned parades or other public events could not reasonably be construed to encompass myriad instances of protected expression occurring outside of public events. Because the ordinance under which petitioner was convicted swept too broadly in banning protected forms of expressive conduct involving horn honking, it failed constitutional scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

The State petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the appellate court erroneously applied the actual innocence doctrine to hear petitioner's untimely personal restraint petition (PRP) prior to considering his other claimed exceptions to the time bar in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090. Petitioner raised other statutory claims to avoid the time bar. Petitioner's actual innocence claim failed on the merits because he neither raised a constitutional error nor met his burden of proof to show factual innocence. Because petitioner sought to evade the PRP time bar under the actual innocence doctrine, it was his burden to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, the existence of improperly excluded true facts or the admission of false facts establishing his factual innocence of the predicate offenses giving rise to his persistent offender sentence. Petitioner did not argue that he was innocent of any of his prior offenses. Instead, he argued that his California assault conviction should not have counted toward his persistent offender sentence. This was a claim of legal error. Therefore, petitioner failed to meet his burden to prove that he was actually innocent of being a persistent offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington Court of Appeals rejected petitioner inmate's constitutional argument and denied his request for relief in his personal restraint petition (PRP) on that basis. It determined that the inmate correctly calculated his time already served and ordered that respondent Department of Corrections (Department) credit him with 518 days for time already served. The inmate petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the issue presented in the case was whether former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.151 (2004) required a county jail to provide opportunities for an inmate who was yet to be sentenced to earn credit toward early release, also known as &quot;good-time&quot; credit. The supreme court found that as applied to the inmate, Skamania County's program for earned early-release credit did not comply with former &sect; 9.92.151(1). Under the county program, the inmate could not earn any type of good-time credit. Because the county's program did not allow the inmate to earn good-time credit, it failed to comply with former &sect; 9.92.151. The statute required a county jail to provide opportunities for a presentence inmate to earn credit toward early release. The inmate was entitled to good-time credit at the statutory maximum rate of 15 percent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Washington State Attorney General, made the State of Washington a plaintiff in a multistate lawsuit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the text of the Washington Constitution and the court's consistent interpretation of the Attorney General's constitutional authority make clear that the Washington Constitution does not vest the Attorney General with any common law powers. However, a writ of mandamus was not available because the Attorney General had no clear duty to withdraw the State from the federal multistate litigation. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.10.030(1) grants the Attorney General discretionary authority to act in any court, state or federal, trial or appellate, on a matter of public concern, provided that there is a cognizable common law or statutory cause of action. The PPACA was unquestionably a matter of public concern in which the State had an interest; its provisions directly affected residents of the state in numerous ways. In addition, there was a cognizable statutory cause of action to enjoin enforcement of unconstitutional actions by the United States government. As such, the Attorney General acted within the authority granted to him by &sect; 43.10.030(1) when he made the State a party to the multistate action seeking to enjoin enforcement of the PPACA.</SPAN></P>

The city's municipal court violated respondent's Wash. Const. art.

On review, the court found that respondent had standing to assert an open administration of justice challenge based upon the exclusion of the general public from her commitment proceedings. Further, the closure of respondent's proceedings satisfied all of the Momah hallmarks for a structural error. The trial court closed the courtroom based upon the mandate in Rule 1.3 without considering the interests involved, the trial court sought no input from respondent concerning the closure, and there was nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court considered respondent's right to the open administration of justice.

The Supreme Court concluded that the protection order was not void. The superior court had jurisdiction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.50.020(5) to issue the order. Any defects within the order simply went to whether the order was merely erroneous, however flagrant and could not be collaterally attacked. Defendant's remedy was to seek modification of the order by the court that issued it; he was not free to violate the order with impunity. The collateral bar rule prohibited defendant's challenge to the validity of the order. Defendant's prosecution did not violate due process. Because defendant had notice that violation of the order was a crime under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 26.50, he had fair warning of the type of conduct that was criminal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that petitioner failed to meet his burden of proving that the statutes establishing the Court of Appeals were unconstitutional. Petitioner failed to establish that the words &quot;free and equal&quot; under art. I, &sect; 19, required voting districts with equal populations in the unique context of the Court of Appeals, which had been elected by districts drawn along county lines for over 40 years. Washington history, case law, and logic suggested that these districts did not need to be numerically equal for judicial elections to be &quot;free and equal&quot; under art. I, &sect; 19. The court rejected petitioner's argument that the Court of Appeals' system of assigning judges violated art. I, &sect; 19. The system was a good faith attempt to include judges from all regions of the state, randomly assigning cases so that no particular litigant or judge could control the docket.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the 13-year-old student was absent from school on 73 of the first 100 days of the school year, the school district filed a truancy petition pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.225.035. At the initial hearing, the juvenile court found the student to be truant and ordered her to attend school on a regular basis. When the student continued to miss school, the school district initiated contempt proceedings. Despite being held in contempt, the student continued to miss school, which resulted in additional contempt hearing proceedings. Thereafter, the student's attorney moved to set aside the truancy finding, arguing that her due process rights were violated because she had not been represented by counsel. The juvenile court denied the motion, but the appellate court reversed. On review, the court held that the due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, did not require the appointment of counsel to represent the student at the initial truancy hearing because the hearing had little to no adverse effect on the student's privacy interests and presented little risk of an erroneous deprivation of any right, including the student's right to an education.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 22 were violated when a prosecutor posed questions to appellant that inferred that he tailored his testimony. The appellate court affirmed appellant's convictions. The court affirmed, although for different reasons than the appellate court. In the context of prosecutorial suggestions of tailoring, Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 was more protective than the Sixth Amendment. The court believed that suggestions that tailoring were appropriate during cross-examination was compatible with the protections provided by Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. Prohibiting the kind of questioning where the defendant stated that he based his testimony, in part, on testimony of others would inhibit the jury's ability to judge credibility. In a case such as this one, where the credibility of the defendant was key, it was fair to allow the prosecutor to ask questions that would assist the fact finder in determining whether the defendant was being honest. The State did not violate Article I, &sect; 22 by posing questions during cross-examination that were designed to elicit answers that indicated if appellant tailored his testimony.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that denying defendant credit for time served on EHM did not violate equal protection principles. Not requiring credit for a misdemeanant's presentencing time on EHM served the legitimate state interest of preserving jail time as a possible sentence for misdemeanor defendants. Requiring courts to grant misdemeanants credit for time on EHM would hinder the ability of sentencing judges to order jail time for misdemeanor offenses and would limit misdemeanor sentencing courts' discretion to impose sentences for rehabilitative purposes. Constitutional protections against multiple punishments did not entitle defendant to credit for his presentencing time on EHM because defendant did not show that his conditions of presentencing release were so punitive as to trigger double jeopardy principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ.

Super. Ct. Civ. R. 26(b)(4) that he show substantial need and undue hardship in order to obtain discovery. Nevertheless, the discovery error was harmless. Although petitioner should have received more discovery than he did, the expert was the only expert witness who testified, he had access to the expert's evaluations from SVP cases in the county, and he had a full day of trial time to cross-examine the expert witness regarding his opinion that petitioner had a sparse plan for controlling his behavior if he were released and that, as a result, he was likely to reoffend.</SPAN></P>

As a condition for granting a special sex offender sentencing alternative (SSOSA) sentence, the trial court banished defendant from Cowlitz County and the city of Castle Rock for life.

The court held that the necessities of the case demanded only that the trial court have the opportunity to revise the sentencing condition. To hold otherwise, would unnecessarily chill a defendant's right of direct appeal. Absent necessity, the State's request for the affirmative relief of a completely new resentencing hearing was not properly before the appellate court because the State did not file a cross appeal. The proper remedy in this case was resentencing for the limited purpose of narrowly tailoring the geographic condition of defendant's SSOSA sentence that banished him from Cowlitz County. The geographic condition could be narrowly tailored without disturbing the SSOSA sentence. The trial court knew it had the option to grant or not grant a SSOSA and even that it could apply a geographical restriction. Its error pertained only to the lawful breadth of the particular condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that petitioner's conviction rested on insufficient evidence. At petitioner's criminal trial, the State was required to prove, among other elements, that petitioner was armed with a deadly weapon or assaulted another person. The evidence could not support a finding that petitioner attempted to use a knife against a deputy sheriff. No one saw petitioner with the knife, and he manifested no intent to use it. Furthermore, no one saw petitioner reach for the knife at any time after he was apprehended. When petitioner was apprehended, he did not reach for his knife, but rather, he fled. Though petitioner struggled when the deputy tackled him to the ground, the knife was found along the path of the chase about 15 feet from a farm shop, suggesting that he did not have access to the knife during the scuffle. The only evidence that petitioner attempted to use the knife was an unfastened sheath. This evidence was insufficient to lead a rational factfinder to find intent to use the weapon beyond a reasonable doubt. Because petitioner's conviction rested on insufficient evidence, his conviction violated due process. Thus, petitioner was unlawfully restrained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners argued that an appropriation in the 2009-2011 transportation budget created mandatory duties to expend motor vehicle fund moneys for an unlawful, nonhighway purpose - i.e., light rail. The court concluded that petitioners failed to establish a mandatory ministerial duty requiring DOT to transfer the center lanes of I-90 to a regional transit authority. Furthermore, the appropriation in the 2009-2011 transportation budget authorizing a valuation of the center lanes of I-90 necessarily served a highway purpose under Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 40. The expenditure at issue was for the administration of highway lands. The valuation allowed DOT to explore the feasibility of transferring or leasing the center lanes of I-90 to accommodate light rail mass transit. DOT had specific statutory authority to transfer highway lands, and the decision of whether to transfer or lease lands was inherently a function of the administration of highway property. Since the expenditure served an administrative function, the expenditure indirectly benefited the public highways and was lawful under art. II, &sect; 40.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner university's petition to review a Washington Court of Appeals' decision in which that court reversed the superior court's denial of respondent professor's request for relief from the university board of trustees' order suspending him for two academic quarters. The basis of the court's decision was that the university violated Wash. Rev. Code ch. 34.05, by closing the professor's disciplinary hearing to the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the university's rule authorizing the closure of faculty disciplinary proceedings was consistent with legislative intent. Because the university's faculty handbook was promulgated pursuant to legislative delegation, the court held that it was provision of law expressly authorizing closure within the meaning of Wash. Rev. Code ch. 34.05.449(5). Thus, the university did not engage in an unlawful procedure by closing the professor's disciplinary hearing to the public. Although the professor contended that even if the closure of his disciplinary hearing was pursuant to a provision of law, it ran afoul of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, which stated that justice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay, the court recognized that, by its terms, Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 was not limited to trials but included all judicial proceedings. The stage at which justice was administered and therefore constitutionally required to be open was not reached until a superior court reviewed the action of an administrative agency on appeal. Therefore, Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 did not apply to the quasi-judicial proceedings of administrative agencies.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court declined to grant relief to petitioner because he failed to show that he was unlawfully restrained under Wash. R. App. P. 16.4.

The districts petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The districts argued that the appellate court used the incorrect standard when it determined that the districts had to prove the special education funding mechanism was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that the appellate court applied the proper standard. Even if the districts did present a prima facie case of underfunding, the districts presented no authority suggesting that the burden should then shift to the State to prove that the State did not underfund special education. The court further concluded that Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4, did not preclude applying the basic education allotment (BEA) to special education. When the BEA was included, the special education funding mechanism did not violate the Washington Constitution. For the court to conclude that the BEA should not be included in calculations of how much funding went to special education, it would have to agree with the districts' contention that basic education and special education were in entirely separate realms. The districts attempted to differentiate between basic education and special education services, but the law did not support this distinction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was employed as a choir teacher at a high school. He had sexual intercourse with a member of the high school choir several days prior to her graduation. At the time, the student was 18 years old. Defendant argued that because the statute at issue criminalized sexual intercourse with &quot;minors,&quot; he committed no crime when he had sexual intercourse with an 18-year-old adult. Alternatively, he argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and violated his right to equal protection. The court held that the statute criminalized sexual misconduct between school employees and full time registered students 16 or older. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute's plain language unambiguously defined &quot;minor&quot; as a registered student and thus included students up to the age of 21. The statute did not violate defendant's equal protection rights. In order to defeat the legislation, defendant had to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that no state of facts existed or could be conceived sufficient to justify the challenged classification, or that the facts had so far changed as to render the classification arbitrary and obsolete. Defendant did not carry this burden.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner was sentenced to 347 months' imprisonment on the felony murder charge, 14 months on the assault, and 40.5 months on the robbery. The court concluded that the double jeopardy was violated when the trial court entered convictions for both attempted first degree robbery and second degree assault. Petitioner's assault conviction merged into his conviction for attempted robbery. The sole purpose of the assault was to facilitate the attempted robbery. The assault was not separate and distinct from the attempted robbery; it was incidental to it. The appropriate remedy for the double jeopardy violation was vacating the offending conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board suspended the pharmacist's licenses due to unsatisfactory inspection reports. He sued. The appellate court ruled, in part, that the inspectors were not subject to the pharmacist's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim and the pharmacist's tort claims were barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The court reversed these holdings. In the criminal law context, the deprivation of liberty based on fabricated evidence was a violation of one's right to due process. This applied in a civil proceeding. As long as a sufficient causal connection was established between a defendant official's conduct and the violation, a &sect; 1983 plaintiff did not have to prove that the official personally violated the plaintiff's right. An issue of fact existed over whether the inspectors' conduct caused a violation of the pharmacist's constitutional rights, and whether they arbitrarily lowered his scores in order to fabricate an emergency that would induce the board to shut down the pharmacy. The inspectors were not entitled to qualified immunity. Even if the exhaustion doctrine required the pharmacist to exhaust his claims, they would not be barred because he exhausted the remedies available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Indian tribes, sued appellees, State of Washington and its officials, and contended that sections of the 2003 amendments to the water law were unconstitutional. The King County Superior Court, Washington held that the amendments to the definition of municipal water suppliers in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.03.015 and the retroactivity provision of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.03.330 violated separation of powers. The instant court granted review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1998, in Theodoratus, the court held that under then-existing law, new private water rights did not fully vest until the water was put to a beneficial use, and not merely when the &quot;pumps and pipes&quot; capacity to use the water was built. The court cautioned then that it was not considering municipal water rights, which often received separate treatment in water law. In response, the legislature amended the municipal water law to explicitly define certain nongovernmental water suppliers as municipal and to make that definition retroactive. The court found that there was no general separation of powers violation caused by the amendments to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.03.015(3) and (4) and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.03.330(3) because: (1) the legislature approached its legislative task both thoughtfully and with deference to the court's construction in Theodoratus; (2) it adopted the court's holding prospectively; and (3) it confirmed that the water right represented by a water right certificate issued prior to September 9, 2003, for municipal supply purposes was a right in good standing, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.03.330(3), which was a legislative policy decision, not a factual adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company filed a tax refund suit against respondent Washington State Department of Revenue's finding that an enhanced 911 (E-911) excise tax under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.14B.030(4) (2003) had to be paid on wireless cell phone service. The company challenged a decision of the Thurston County Superior Court (Washington), which dismissed the company's summary judgment motion and granted the same to the Department. The court granted review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state E-911 tax was originally paid on the company's service in 2003, but thereafter the company stopped further payments. The Department then assessed the company for state E-911 taxes. The company paid the assessment and sued. The trial court granted the Department summary judgment and the court affirmed. The company bought airtime from other entities and sold it under the company's name, which brought the company's business within the scope of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 82.14B.020(5), 82.14B.030(4).  By its plain language, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.14B.030(4) imposed the E-911 tax on a company's cell phone service. The cell phone number was what was being taxed. Any difficulty collecting from subscribers was not a bar to imposition and payment of the E-911 tax. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.14B.042 was not unconstitutionally vague as claimed. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.14B.030(4) intended to tax all radio access lines and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.14B.042(2) made the provider of the cellular service ultimately responsible for paying the tax if it was not collected from the subscriber. The company could calculate the amount of tax due.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to 480 months in prison based on the jury's finding by special interrogatory that the assault inflicted great bodily harm, and that the victim's injuries substantially exceeded the level of bodily harm necessary to satisfy the elements of the offense. The court of appeals upheld the sentence. On review, the court found that a permanent &quot;probability of death,&quot; such as a shortened life expectancy and persistent risk of stroke, seizure, or death, such as that which attended the victim's paralysis, fell within the definition of &quot;great bodily harm&quot; in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.110(4)(c). &quot;Great bodily harm&quot; encompassed the most serious injuries short of death. No injury could exceed that level of harm, let alone substantially exceed it. The trial court erred by relying on the jury's finding regarding the severity of the victim's injuries to justify the exceptional sentence that it imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that Congress did not delegate to the states its authority to regulate interstate Internet gambling and that the dormant commerce clause was applicable. The court found that the statute was not discriminatory because it equally prohibited Internet gambling regardless of whether the person or entity hosting the game was located in Washington, another state, or another country. Under the dormant commerce clause, the burden on interstate commerce was not clearly excessive in light of the state interests. The legislature balanced public policy concerns and determined the interests of Washington were best served by banning Internet gambling. The legislature chose the advantages and disadvantages of a ban over the advantages and disadvantages of regulation. The evidence was not conclusive. Although many might disagree with the outcome, the court had no authority to replace the legislature's choice with its own. It was the role of the legislature, not the judiciary, to balance public policy interests and enact law. The court's limited function was to determine whether the statute violated the dormant commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with intimidating a public servant under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.180, fourth degree assault, and resisting arrest. The trial court granted defendant's motion and dismissed the intimidation charge. The Washington Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's dismissal of that charge. Defendant petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before his arrest, defendant struggled violently with the police officers who were attempting to subdue him. From his initial refusal to provide identification to his final thrashings that resulted in two tasings, defendant grew increasingly enraged and violent. After being subdued physically, he resorted to lashing out verbally, hurling threats and insults at the officers. Defendant's behavior amply demonstrated his anger at the situation and at the police officers. However, there was no evidence to suggest that defendant engaged in that behavior, or made his threats, for the purpose of influencing the police officers' actions. Defendant's threats and taunts provided no evidence of any attempt to influence the police officers. In the absence of some evidence suggesting an attempt to influence, the State failed to make a prima facie showing that defendant attempted to influence either officer's official action. Thus, the trial court properly dismissed the charge against defendant for intimidating a public servant under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.180. Accordingly, the court of appeals erred in reversing the trial court's dismissal of the charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.040(4) prohibits the State from compelling respondents to sexually violent predator commitment proceedings to submit to polygraph examinations. The trial court exceeded its statutory authority in ordering the polygraph examination. In addition to issues of unreliability and inadmissibility, polygraph examinations are also invasive, both physically and of one's private affairs. The legislature knows how to permit such evaluations, but, aware of the concerns about the reliability of the results and intrusiveness upon privacy interests, declined to do so. The court noted that an expert testified at the probable cause hearing that, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, petitioner was likely to reoffend. The expert reached this conclusion without the use or review of a polygraph examination. The court was satisfied that professional evaluators would be able to reach conclusions without the use of such evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates were convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and conspiracy to commit that crime. At sentencing, as a condition of community custody, they were barred from using items that could be used to ingest or process controlled substances, or to facilitate the sale or transfer of controlled substances. The inmates challenged the condition as unconstitutionally vague. The court of appeals declined to entertain their challenge, concluding it was not ripe for review because they were still incarcerated. On review, the court found that the inmates' claim satisfied the ripeness test set forth in Bahl. The condition would immediately restrict their conduct upon their release from prison. Further, the vague scope of proscribed conduct failed to provide the inmates with fair notice of what they could and could not do. Because the condition could potentially encompass a wide range of everyday items, it did not provide ascertainable standards of guilt to protect against arbitrary enforcement. A condition that left so much to the discretion of individual community corrections officers was unconstitutionally vague under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

The county petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State and county contended that the common enemy rule applied, whereas the property owners argued that the natural watercourse rule applied. The court concluded that there were genuine issues of material fact that precluded summary judgment. The only evidence that was presented to the trial court supported the owners' argument that the water that washed away their property was water in the natural watercourse, not surface water. The owners' theory was that the road and dike work impacted the river by cutting off natural overflow channels in the floodplain, thereby forcing all of the flow during the high-water event into the main channel and onto their property. The availability of the common enemy defense turned on whether the water in question was surface water or water in a natural watercourse. That was a factual question. Because there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the water at issue was water in a natural watercourse or surface water and whether the damage to the owners' property was a necessary incident to defendants' work on the dike, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted on two stalking charges. The appellate court affirmed and the court affirmed that decision. Given the plain meanings of the terms &quot;occasion,&quot; and &quot;separate,&quot; the term &quot;separate occasions&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.110 was unambiguous. The court agreed that the only reasonable interpretation of the term was a distinct, noncontiguous occurrence or incident. Stalking convictions required evidence of two or more distinct, individual, noncontiguous occurrences of following or harassment, and no minimum amount of time had to elapse between the occurrences, provided they were somehow separable. One incident of stalking consisted of four distinct episodes, each separated by a significant interruption of petitioner's contact with the victim. During each episode, petitioner deliberately maintained visual and physical proximity to the victim while petitioner was in his van and the victim was walking. Each episode constituted a separate occasion of following and the jury could have found petitioner guilty of stalking. Petitioner's conduct did not just fall outside the norm, as the dissent suggested, it was threatening.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owner sought review of an order from the Washington Court of Appeals, which, in an encroachment matter, upheld a trial court's order requiring petitioner to deed respondent property owners an acre of land and to accept payment for the value of the land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents unwittingly built their house entirely on a portion of land owned by their neighbor, petitioner. Petitioner did not realize that they were encroaching at the time, but, when he learned of the true boundary line between the properties, he sued to eject them. The trial court refused to issue an injunction forcing respondents to remove their home. The trial court instead required petitioner to deed them the acre underlying it and accept payment for the value of the land. The Court of Appeals upheld the judgment. On review, the court found that the trial court's equitable approach fit comfortably within the good-faith-mistake line of cases in which equity allowed a court to apply a liability rule in lieu of rote application of a property rule. The benefit of removal to petitioner would be to gain an acre. The acre would not appreciably increase the value or size of his 30-acre parcel. In contrast, ejectment would impose a great hardship on respondents because they would have to remove and reconstruct their house and garage and drill a new well. With the trial court's remedy, petitioner did not forfeit the right to his land, nor did respondents get something for nothing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant #1 was convicted of first degree robbery and second degree assault, but the trial court conditionally vacated the assault conviction and sentenced him only for the robbery. Defendant #2 was found guilty of first degree murder and second degree felony murder, but the trial court conditionally vacated the felony murder conviction and sentenced him only for first degree murder. The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed both decisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants petitioned for review. The petitions were consolidated. Both defendants argued that double jeopardy demanded nothing less than the permanent, unconditional vacation of their lesser convictions. The court concluded that the conditional vacations attempted by the trial court in both cases violated double jeopardy principles. The conditional written order appended to defendant #1's judgment and sentence and the similar language at defendant #2's sentencing both openly recognized the validity of defendants' vacated lesser convictions, even though such references offended double jeopardy and were not allowed. The trial courts in both cases vacated the lesser of two convictions that each defendant received for his offense. The trial courts also attempted to keep the vacated convictions &quot;alive&quot; for purposes of possible reinstatement should the convictions for the greater offenses be reversed. This contravened double jeopardy, and it found no support in double jeopardy jurisprudence. The lesser convictions, once vacated, and prior to reinstatement, were not valid convictions and were not entitled to some weight.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court in both cases and remanded to the trial courts with directions to (1) enter a corrected judgment removing the conditional vacation order appended to defendant #1's judgment and sentence and (2) redact all references to any validity or import attributable to the vacated lesser conviction in defendant #2's case.</SPAN></P>

The employee entered into a settlement agreement with the third party for $ 1.4 million in damages, $ 793,083 of which was categorized as pain and suffering. The Department used the entire settlement sum in its reimbursement calculation. The court of appeals held that the because the Department had not compensated the employee for pain and suffering, it could not be reimbursed from funds designated to compensate him for his pain and suffering. On appeal, the court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.24.030(5) did not authorize the Department to subject pain and suffering damages to its reimbursement calculation. The Department did not pay out benefits for pain and suffering; therefore, it could not be &quot;reimbursed&quot; from amounts recovered for pain and suffering.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a personal restraint petition (PRP), challenging his sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole under the &quot;three strikes&quot; provision of the Washington Persistent Offender Accountability Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(4) (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1991, petitioner was convicted of second-degree assault. In 1996, he was convicted of violating the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 69.50, based on his possession of methamphetamine. The jury also found, by special verdict, that he was armed with a firearm. In 1997, he was convicted of second-degree assault. The trial court held that the crime was a most serious offense and that his two previous offenses were also most serious offenses. The trial court found that he was a persistent offender and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(4) (1996). He filed a PRP, arguing that the second conviction on which his sentence relied was not a most serious offense. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.125 (1983) expressly defined all firearms as deadly weapons. The jury's verdict was therefore a &quot;deadly weapon verdict under &sect; 9.94A.125,&quot; Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.030(23)(t) (1996), and, thus, a most serious offense that was properly counted in determining whether he should be sentenced as a persistent offender. Because the judgment and life sentence were facially valid, his PRP was time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the PRP as time-barred under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of felony harassment - threats to kill, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.020(1)(a)(i), (b), (2)(b). The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed defendant's convictions. Defendant petitioned for review, assigning error to the trial court's failure to give the jury a true threat instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he did not make a true threat, as constitutionally required, because he was describing his mental state and the contents of a dream he was having to a mental health specialist after calling a crisis services hotline. The court held that the threats-to-kill provision of the harassment statute must be read in light of the First Amendment to proscribe only &quot;true threats.&quot; The provision therefore required proof that defendant was (at least) negligent as to his threats' effect on listeners. The jury could have convicted defendant based on something less than a &quot;true threat.&quot; The error was manifest and affected a constitutional right. The omission of a true threat instruction was not harmless. Reversal was required because the jury was not asked to decide whether a reasonable person in defendant's position would foresee that his statements or acts would be interpreted as a serious expression of intent to carry out the threat, and the evidence was ambiguous on the point. Dismissal of the charges was not required, however, because there was ample evidence from which a reasonable jury could determine that defendant's threats were &quot;true threats.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, three death row inmates, challenged the constitutionality of Washington's three-drug lethal injection protocol for carrying out a sentence of death. The Thurston County Superior Court, Washington, upheld the lethal injection protocol. The inmates appealed. Respondent State cross-appealed the trial court's refusal to dismiss the case as time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court heard oral argument, the Washington Department of Corrections (DOC) abandoned the three-drug method of execution and adopted a one-drug protocol. The court concluded that the inmates' challenge to the protocol was not time-barred. The three-year statute of limitations to file a claim challenging an execution protocol amended in 2007, again in 2008, and again in 2010, did not run by the time the inmates filed this lawsuit in 2008. The court further concluded that DOC's authorship of the protocol governing lethal injection is permitted by a legislative delegation of powers arising from Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95.180(1) and related provisions. DOC was not required to draft the death penalty protocol within the administrative rule-making process. The court declined to issue a declaration that DOC's actions violate the state Uniform Controlled Substances Act or the federal Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act in the absence of a showing that either act overrides statutory law governing executions. Finally, the court concluded that the inmates' constitutional challenge to the three-drug protocol was moot in light of DOC's adoption of the one-drug protocol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the inmates' nonconstitutional claims and dismissed their constitutional claims as moot. Given the court's resolution of this case, a stay of execution for one of the inmates entered by the court pending the decision in this matter was lifted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion to suppress, but the appellate court reversed. On review, the court reversed the appellate court's decision. While the warrant for petitioner's passenger's arrest gave a deputy a valid basis for arresting her, he had no reason to believe that the vehicle contained evidence of the crime of trespass, for which she was arrested, nor did the deputy have reason to believe that she posed a safety risk because she was already in custody at the time of the search. Just because petitioner, the driver, was unsecured at the time of the search, this did not justify the search. Thus, the deputy had no authority to search petitioner's vehicle, and the search violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court rejected the argument that the good faith exception was consistent with the court's past decisions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both suits were dismissed because plaintiffs failed to give defendants required notice under former Wash. Rev.

The court agreed with plaintiffs that the notice requirement was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers. The statute conflicted with the procedures for the commencement of a civil action under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 3(a) by adding a step for commencing a suit not required by the court rule. The conflict between the statute and the court rule could not be harmonized and both could not be given effect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions of child rape, sexual exploitation of a minor, and child molestation, it reversed his convictions of 20 counts of possession of child pornography, holding that the defense was entitled to a mirror image copy of the defendant's computer hard drives where the pornographic images were stored but was denied such. On review, the court held that, where defendant's own computer was seized, analyzed by the State, and used as evidence, defendant was entitled under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 4.7(a)(1)(v) to a mirror image copy of the hard drives for analysis by an expert at an appropriately secured laboratory. Adequate representation required providing a mirror image of that hard drive to counsel, enabling the defense attorney to consult with computer experts who can tell how the evidence made its way onto the computer. Forensic review might show that someone other than the defendant caused certain images to be downloaded. It might indicate when the images were downloaded, and it might reveal how often and how recently images were viewed and other useful information based on where the images were stored on the device.</SPAN></P>

App. P. 16.4(c) to preclude the Washington Department of Corrections (DOC) from reclassifying him, revoking his community custody, and returning him to total confinement to serve the balance of his original sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of drug offenses and was sentenced to a split term of total confinement followed by a term of community custody. One of the conditions of community custody required defendant to obey all laws. After he was released from confinement, the DOC transferred defendant to community custody. Subsequently, however, the DOC determined that defendant had violated the condition that he obey all laws by threatening to kill his sister-in-law, and it exercised its discretion to reclassify defendant and return him to confinement. Defendant filed a petition seeking to restrain the DOC. On review, the court held that the notice given to defendant was insufficient to satisfy the due process notice requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because the notice failed to state which law defendant failed to obey. Merely stating that defendant threatened to kill someone did not reflect the elements of the statute that the State alleged defendant to have violated. Notice of the specific statute was required in order to guarantee the fairest opportunity for defendant to isolate the various elements of the crime and present facts in his defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's personal restraint petition was granted, and the disposition of the DOC's hearing officer was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington certified the following question to the court: Whether a public library, consistent with Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, may filter Internet access for all patrons without disabling websites containing constitutionally-protected speech upon the request of an adult library patron.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were library patrons who used computers that defendant regional library made available to access the Internet. Each claimed that access to certain websites was blocked by the library's Internet filter. The court concluded that a public library may, subject to the limitation set forth in its opinion, filter Internet access for all patrons, including adults, without violating Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. Because adults can request and obtain unblocking of erroneously blocked sites, no overbreadth problem exists under art. I, &sect; 5, as a result of overblocking. In addition, no overbreadth occurs as a result of a library's choice to block Internet access to pornography, adult materials, and nudity/risque materials. Art. I, &sect; 5, is not violated by a library's Internet filtering policy if it is reasonable when measured in light of the library's mission and policies, and is viewpoint neutral. While the court concluded, on this record, that the library's filtering policy did not violate art. I, &sect; 5, it recognized that applying this constitutional provision according to the legal principles it delineated in this opinion to the facts of this case was a matter for the federal court.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals, Division Three (Washington) reversed and reinstated a board's ruling the directed petitioner owner to evict from his park tenants occupying a recreational vehicle (RV) as primary residences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was directed to remove an RV from his park, but he did not comply.

The court affirmed the appellate court's decision. Certain statutes,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 59.20.080, 59.20.130, conferred concurrent jurisdiction on local authorities. This accorded with the stated purpose underlying the Act. In addition, the ordinance furthered the Act's purpose. Pasco, Washington, chose through zoning to separate mobile home parks from RV parks. The court concluded that the state legislature did not intend to preempt the field of mobile home tenancy regulation. Because the ordinance could be harmonized with the Act, the two laws did not conflict for purposes of Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner union filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel respondent, the Governor of Washington, to revise the budget she submitted to the Washington Legislature pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.39A.300 so as to include funds to implement pay increases for 25,000 in-home personal care providers awarded by an arbitrator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court observed that a budget revision would have required the Governor to reduce or remove other budgetary items to balance the union's demands. These redistributive budgetary decisions required that the Governor exercise discretion and judgment as an independent constitutional officer. The severe economic difficulties faced by the state presented circumstances dictating judicial restraint. The writ requested would have required the Governor to include in her biennial budget pay raises that most state workers neither received nor supported, and that the Washington Legislature chose not to fund in the adopted budget. Such pay increases would almost certainly go unfunded again. Since the budget revision sought by the union was discretionary rather than a ministerial duty, the court concluded that issuance of a writ of mandamus was inappropriate and dismissed the petition. Even if mandamus were an appropriate remedy, the court could not fully grant the relief sought by the union - a change in the biennial budget already adopted by the Legislature and signed by the Governor. Thus, the petition was alternatively subject to dismissal on mootness grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent stepfather petitioned to be named a child's de facto parent and sought residential time with her.

The Washington Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's judgment. Review was accepted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the de facto parentage doctrine did not apply under the circumstances present in this case. When the stepfather entered the child's life, the child's legal parents and their respective roles were already established. The court perceived no statutory void and could not apply an equitable remedy that infringed upon the rights and duties of the existing parents. The legislature had provided a remedy for a stepparent seeking a custodial relationship with a stepchild by enabling the stepparent to petition for custody. Although the court adopted the de facto parentage doctrine in In re Parentage of L.B., which involved parties who were involved in a long-term committed same-sex relationship and who shared parenting responsibilities for a child and held themselves out to the public as a family, the stepfather in this case was a third-party to the two already existing parents, which placed him in a very different position than the respondent in L.B. These differences, as well as the presence of a statutory remedy available to the stepfather, supported the court's conclusion that the de facto parentage doctrine should not extend to the circumstances in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners claimed that the irrigation district violated their right to due process. The court concluded that the irrigation district acted lawfully. Because no assessment occurred during the add lands process, the landowners were not deprived of their property. An assessment levied on the landowners' properties was contingent on a subsequent action, namely the formation of an LID. At the add lands phase, any harm to the landowners' property interests was inchoate and outside the bounds of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Other than providing the landowners notice and a hearing on the question of special benefits at some point before levying an assessment, the irrigation district was obligated only to follow the law set forth by the legislature. Because the irrigation district received petitions from holders of title representing one-half or more of any body of lands, it complied with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 87.03.560. The formation of the LID did not violate the guaranty of free and fair elections set forth in Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. Because the formation of the LID was not predicated on an election, the protection of voting rights in art. I, &sect; 19, did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the infraction was a significant issue in litigation and that having it vacated achieved some of the benefit the prisoner sought in bringing suit, even if it did not result in monetary damages. The prisoner's actions also resulted in the alteration of the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the behavior of the Washington Department of Corrections in a way that directly benefited the prisoner, as an infraction that he once had on his record was no longer there. The Prison Litigation Reform Act did not preclude an award of attorney fees for the issues the prisoner successfully appealed. The prisoner, who brought claims for violations of his rights to free speech, substantive due process, and for retaliation, among other claims, would be entitled to attorney fees on remand for all of his successful claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's ruling that prevented the prisoner from obtaining attorney fees was reversed, and the case was remanded to the appellate court to determine the attorney fees award for the prisoner's successful litigation. The case was further remanded to the trial court for litigation of the prisoner's claims for damages for retaliation, First Amendment violations, and substantive due process violations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Law enforcement officers arrested defendant, then 17 years of age, for possessing a loaded.380 semiautomatic handgun. The Kitsap County Superior Court, Washington, found defendant guilty of second degree firearms possession under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(2)(a)(iii). The trial court sentenced defendant to 10 days' juvenile detention, 1 year of supervision, 30 hours of community service, and a $ 100 fine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, which transferred the matter to itself solely on the issue of the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(2)(a)(iii) and the effect of District of Columbia v. Heller, held that the Second Amendment applies to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms from state interference through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This right is necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered liberty and fundamental to the American scheme of justice. However, defendant failed to demonstrate on this record that the statute infringed on his right to bear arms under either constitution. Defendant failed to provide convincing authority supporting an original meaning of the Second Amendment, which would grant all children an unfettered right to bear arms. Similarly, defendant mentioned the statute violated his right to bear arms under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 24, but he cited no authority and made no argument for this proposition. The court was unconvinced that &sect; 9.41.040(2)(a)(iii) violated either state or federal constitutional right to bear arms on the sparse record before it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the Washington Court of Appeals for further proceedings on the remaining issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a police interview, defendant made statements in which he recounted the events surrounding the alleged offense. In dismissing the charge, the trial court ruled that defendant's statements were inadmissible because Wash. Rev.

The instant court concluded that the trial court erred in determining the statute was unconstitutional based on a finding that the Opper standard set a constitutional minimum due process standard from which the legislature could not depart. However, the case did not need to be remanded because the State lacked any other evidence to proceed with the prosecution. Even if defendant's statements were admissible, no other evidence existed to establish the corpus delicti independent of the statements. Without any evidence of guilt, the State had no evidence, much less sufficient evidence, to meet its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The case did not have to be remanded because the State lacked any other evidence to proceed with the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of more than 40 grams of marijuana under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.4014. Division Three of the Court of Appeals (Washington) upheld the trial court's decision to allow evidence of marijuana seized at defendant's home pursuant to a warrant and declined to allow him to claim the compassionate use defense at trial under former Wash. Rev. Code 69.51A.040 (1999). Defendant sought review, which the court granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the marijuana evidence should have been suppressed because the presentation of a medical marijuana authorization negated probable cause. The trial court denied a motion to suppress and refused to allow defendant to present a compassionate use defense. The appellate court affirmed. On review, the court also affirmed. Based on the information of a marijuana growing operation and the strong odor of marijuana when the officers approached defendant's home, a reasonable inference, for Fourth Amendment purposes, was established that criminal activity was taking place. While defendant presented the officer with documentation purporting to authorize his use of marijuana, this created only a potential affirmative defense and did not result in making the act of possessing and using marijuana noncriminal or negate any elements of the offense or probable cause. Defendant's conditions of severe anxiety and rage did not amount to a qualifying condition for purposes of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.51A.010(3). The court would not extend former Wash. Rev. Code 69.51A.040 (1999) to permit an individual without a qualifying illness to claim its benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fish cart crushed plaintiff seaman's arm while he was working aboard defendant employer's ship. The seaman sued the employer, seeking compensation for negligence under the Jones Act and under the general maritime doctrine of unseaworthiness. After a bench trial, the King County Superior Court, Washington, ruled for the seaman on both claims and awarded him damages and prejudgment interest. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case required the court to decide whether a defendant in a Jones Act and general maritime suit filed in state court has a right to a jury trial and whether prejudgment interest is available in such a case. The court held that the employer had a right to a jury trial of the seaman's claims. The Jones Act does not provide the plaintiff a substantive federal right to determine the mode (jury/nonjury) of trial. The Jones Act entitles the plaintiff to elect only the jurisdictional basis for the suit. Once the plaintiff has chosen a suit at law in state court, state procedural law determines whether the parties may demand a jury trial. The Washington Constitution affords Jones Act litigants a jury trial right because the Jones Act is rooted in negligence and so fits within the jury trial right's 1889 purview. The seaman had no substantive right to a nonjury trial. The court further held that prejudgment interest is available in mixed maritime cases. If the employer was concerned that it might have to pay interest on damages arising solely out of the Jones Act claim, it could ask for a special verdict form apportioning damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals of Washington that affirmed his convictions of domestic violence and felony violation of a court order in the form of a protective order, arguing that the admission of a recorded 911 call placed by his wife violated the Confrontation Clauses of the state and federal constitutions, Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's wife called 911 and told the operator that defendant had beaten her and that she was in need of medical assistance. At defendant's trial, a recording of the 911 was played for the jury to hear. On review, the court held that the wife's statement to the 911 operator were nontestimonial; therefore, the admission of the recording of the 911 call did not violate defendant's confrontation right. The statements made by defendant's wife to the 911 operator fell within the res gestae doctrine because they were statements growing out of the assault upon her, not merely a narrative of what had happened, and they explained events that had occurred within minutes as well as present and continuing circumstances. They were statements of fact, not opinion, and they were spontaneous utterances dominated and evoked by the events themselves without premeditation or reflection.

The Court of Appeals, Division Two (Washington) reversed and remanded with instructions to suppress evidence from an automobile search, for purposes of U.S. Const. amend. IV and Wash. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants one and two, the driver and passenger in a car, were ultimately convicted of possession with intent to deliver after a search of the car revealed methamphetamine under a cup holder. The appellate court ruled that suppression of this evidence was required. The court affirmed. After an arrestee was secured and removed from the automobile, he posed no risk of obtaining a weapon or concealing or destroying evidence. The arrestee's presence did not justify a warrantless search under the search incident to arrest exception. The expansive interpretation to the contrary set forth in State v. Stroud, 720 P.2d 436 (1986) was influenced by an improperly broad interpretation of other case law and that portion of Stroud's holding was overruled. At the time of the search, defendant one was handcuffed and secured in a patrol car. He no longer had access to the car and the search therefore was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The evidence gathered during the search was inadmissible and should have been suppressed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's motion for discretionary review of the decision on remand by the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) to impanel a jury under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.537(2) to determine if there were aggravating factors to support an exceptional sentence for first degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court lacked authority to impanel a jury for the purposes of determining if factors supported an exceptional sentence. The court affirmed. The fact that defendant was not given notice prior to trial of the State's intention to seek an exceptional sentence did not run afoul of the plain language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.537(1). The notice provision had no application to defendant. He was tried and convicted in 2002, three years prior to the 2005 enactment of the statute and the notice provision did not apply retroactively. The absence of an allegation of aggravating circumstances in the information did not prevent the imposition of an exceptional sentence. Defendant received adequate notice. The absence of an allegation of aggravating circumstances in the information did not violate defendant's rights under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22, the Sixth Amendment, or due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine. After holding a post-trial suppression hearing, the trial court denied the motion. The Court of Appeals (Washington) affirmed and held that under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7, an officer had reasonable suspicion to search the residence in question, and in the alternative, the evidence was admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had argued that the evidence gathered as a result of a warrantless search should have been suppressed. The trial court denied his motion to suppress and the appellate court affirmed, but the court reversed and remanded for a new suppression hearing. A probation officer had to have probable cause to believe that a probationer resided at a particular residence before searching that residence. Probable cause existed when an officer had information that would lead a person to believe that the probationer lived at the place to be searched. Because the court below did not apply the proper probable cause standard, the court remanded for further proceedings to determine whether the community corrections officer had probable cause to believe that defendant resided at the residence at the time of the search. Resolution of the case required the court to decide whether in the absence of probable cause the challenged evidence was nonetheless admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine. Consistent with precedent, the court rejected the inevitable discovery doctrine because it was incompatible with the nearly categorical exclusionary rule under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent school district, along with individual teachers, parents, and students, sued petitioner State, seeking a declaration that the State's continued use of disparate salary figures in its funding formulas violated Wash. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2, and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 and 12. The King County Superior Court (Washington) granted summary judgment for the district and the individual respondents. The State was granted direct review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district argued that the school funding system violated the uniformity requirement of Wash. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, because funding for staff salaries in some school districts was calculated using different base salary figures than for others. The court concluded that the State's funding formulas did not violate the Washington Constitution. Wash. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, did not require uniform funding. The district did not cite any persuasive authority for its argument that Wash. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, required the State to calculate basic education funding using uniform salary figures statewide. The provision required uniformity in the educational program provided, not the minutiae of funding. Such details - unless specifically mandated by the Washington Constitution - were the province of the legislature. None of the individual respondents presented justiciable claims. The individual respondents did not establish any benefit they were personally being denied. Although the individual respondents argued that the funding system created actual harm, they showed no educational opportunities unequal to those provided in other school districts in violation of the Washington Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's building code enforcement department found that many of the owner's properties were in violation of building codes. The department assessed civil penalties. The owner brought an action against the city, seeking to bar it from enforcing its building code against him on numerous grounds, including that his rights to due process were violated. The trial court awarded summary judgment to the city. The Court of Appeals held that the owner's claims were barred because he failed to follow the procedures of the Washington Land Use Petition Act (LUPA). On appeal, the court held that LUPA, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.020(1)(c) (1995), did not bar the owner's claims. Absent its own complete system, the city was required by Wash. Rev. Code ch. 7.80 to follow the legislature's default system and enforce its infractions in courts of limited jurisdiction. Further, the owner's due process rights were violated. The sections of the city's building code that purported to authorize the unlimited and unreviewable issuance and enforcement of subsequent civil infractions and penalties without any system of procedural safeguards were unconstitutional on their face and as applied to the owner.</SPAN></P>

His risk classification was twice reassessed in accordance with Washington Department of Corrections (DOC) policy. After the second reassessment, he was reclassified from RM-C to RM-B and no longer eligible to earn a 50 percent reduction in his sentence. A superintendent upheld the change in his classification. The inmate filed a personal restraint petition, claiming he was denied due process when his risk classification was changed without advanced notice or an opportunity to be heard. The Court of Appeals denied the petition. On review, the court determined that under the scheme of &quot;earned early release&quot; in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.728(1)(b)(ii)(A), the inmate had no liberty interest in earning credits at a 50 percent rate. Because he had no liberty interest, he was guaranteed only that the DOC would follow its procedures to reclassify him. He was afforded all of the procedures. The inmate was not precluded from once again becoming eligible for a 50 percent reduction. Policies established by the DOC allowed that he could be reclassified to an eligible risk category.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his arrest, defendant remained in custody pending trial; the State and defendant's codefendant sought various continuances. Defendant's motions for dismissal were denied, and he was eventually convicted on four counts of first degree robbery. The Washington Court of Appeals reversed on grounds that the eight-month delay between arrest and trial violated defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial. The State petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended that no violation of defendant's speedy trial rights occurred because the delay between the arrest and his first trial was not long enough to be presumptively prejudicial under either Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 or U.S. Const. amend. VI; it also argued that the balancing of the relevant factors under Barker demonstrated that there was no constitutional violation. The supreme court agreed in part, holding that Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 required a method of analysis substantially the same as the federal Sixth Amendment analysis and did not afford defendant greater speedy trial rights. However, the supreme court also found that the pretrial delay here was presumptively prejudicial. Nonetheless, the trial court had good reasons for granting each of the continuances defendant challenged and acted within the constitutional limits in balancing the competing interests of trying the codefendants jointly, accommodating trial preparation and scheduling concerns, and securing defendant's constitutional rights. While the more than eight-month pretrial delay was presumptively prejudicial, the delay did not result in a violation of defendant's speedy trial rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with second-degree assault. At trial, he argued that he acted in self-defense. Without his request or objection, the trial court instructed the jury as to the meaning of &quot;malice&quot; used in a self-defense instruction. He was convicted as charged. He challenged his conviction on the ground the instruction provided an incomplete definition of &quot;malice&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.110(12). The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction. On review, the court held that the trial court's failure to provide the full statutory definition did not constitute manifest error because the omission did not create practical and identifiable consequences during the trial that should have been obvious to the trial court. The instruction did not relieve the State of its obligation to prove the elements of the crime and disprove that defendant acted in self-defense. The error alleged by defendant was not of a constitutional magnitude or manifest. He therefore failed to satisfy the manifest constitutional error exception in Wash. R. App. P. 2.5(a). As his claim of error was unpreserved and did not meet Rule 2.5(a), it was not necessary for the Court of Appeals to review the claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of rape of a child and four counts of child molestation, and an exceptional sentence of 560 months for each count was imposed, to be served concurrently. Two counts were reversed on appeal. The case was remanded for retrial, but the State elected not to retry the two reversed counts. The Washington Court of Appeals granted the State's motion to dismiss defendant's appeal. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended his case was not final for purposes of retroactivity when Blakely was decided and that the trial court erred when, on remand, it refused to resentence him in accordance with the requirements of Blakely. Defendant also argued the appellate court erred when it granted the State's motion to dismiss for failure to raise an appealable issue. The supreme court disagreed, finding that two of defendant's convictions were reversed, while five were affirmed, and defendant did not challenge his sentencing on appeal. His case was remanded for further proceedings, with the possibility that the State would retry defendant's reversed counts, but the State did not retry the reversed convictions. Although the trial court had discretion under Wash. R. App. P. 2.5(c)(1) to revisit defendant's exceptional sentence on the remaining five convictions, it did not. Therefore, no appealable issues remained, and defendant's case continued to be final for purposes of retroactivity when the time to petition for certiorari elapsed 90 days following the issuance of the supreme court's mandate. Thus, the appellate court did not err when it dismissed defendant's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sued defendants for negligently failing to diagnose her ovarian cancer. The Chelan County Superior Court, Washington, dismissed the lawsuit because the patient failed to file a certificate of merit from a medical expert, as required for medical malpractice lawsuits under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.70.150. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.70.150 is unconstitutional. The statute requires plaintiffs in medical malpractice actions to file a certificate of merit with the pleadings. The certificate of merit must contain a statement from an expert that, based on the information known at the time of executing the certificate of merit, there is a reasonable probability that the defendant's conduct did not follow the accepted standard of care. This requirement directly conflicts with Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 11, which states that attorneys do not have to verify pleadings in medical malpractice actions, as well as Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 8, which details Washington's system of notice pleading. The certificate of merit requirement essentially requires plaintiffs to submit evidence supporting their claims before they even have an opportunity to conduct discovery and obtain such evidence. The statute unduly burdens the right of medical malpractice plaintiffs to conduct discovery and, therefore, violates their right to access courts. In addition, the statute changes the procedures for filing pleadings in a lawsuit, thereby jeopardizing a court's power to set court procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reversing defendants' convictions, the appellate court majority held that the judge was not properly elected to the position of municipal court judge and did not possess de facto authority. On review, the City contended the appellate court erred in holding that former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 3.46.070 applied to the judge's election. The supreme court agreed, holding that the judge had de jure authority to hear the defendants' cases as a properly elected district court judge and member of the municipal department. Under the City-County agreement, the judge was automatically designated as a member of the municipal department upon her election to the district court. Her appointment as a municipal judge was a direct result of her election and therefore was not inconsistent with former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 3.46.063, which required municipal court positions to be filled by election. The judge's election was for a district court office, not full time municipal judge, and therefore her election did not have to be only by city voters under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 3.46.070.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that (1) the condition required the State to prove he willfully violated the condition, (2) the due process clauses of the U.S. and Washington Constitutions required the State to prove he willfully violated the condition, and (3) there was insufficient evidence for the trial court to revoke his SSOSA sentence. The instant court concluded that the State was not required to prove defendant willfully was in an area where minors were known to congregate. The condition forbidding defendant from frequenting areas where minors congregated served as a way to prevent him from being in a situation where he would have an opportunity to again harm a child. The evidence was sufficient to support the revocation of defendant's SSOSA sentence. Defendant went to a food bank located in an elementary school that was connected with a church. The trial court could reasonably conclude that the location of the food bank in a building housing a church school presented a risk to the safety or welfare of society. This violation, combined with defendant's prior violations for visiting a church, high school, and a park on three separate occasions, justified revoking his SSOSA sentence.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The city's application of the moratorium to deny the permit application violated the church's exercise of religion where the city conceded the sincerity of the church's belief that hosting the homeless camp was central to its exercise of religion, and the refusal to process the application was a substantial burden on religious exercise. Although housing the homeless was different from prayer or services, the city's total moratorium prevented the church from even applying for a permit. The moratorium gave the church no alternatives. Moreover, the city failed to show that the moratorium was a narrow means of achieving a compelling goal. Although the church breached its agreement with the camp sponsor by not obtaining a valid temporary use permit, the church was excused from full compliance when the city rejected the church's application without even considering it.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court noted that pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.040(2), the firefighters received an excess payment under the 1955 Act in addition to their payment under LEOFF. The statute plainly required the firefighters' benefits to be calculated using a battalion chief's salary. Excess payments had to be calculated according to the provisions of the pension system under which the firefighters were paid. The legislature specifically indicated that LEOFF would not take effect until March 1, 1970, after the February amendment striking the language upon which the firefighters relied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of premeditated first degree murder, was sentenced to death, but the death sentence was reversed on appeal. On remand, a jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed four aggravating factors. On the basis of the jury's decision, the trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed. Defendant petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the aggravating factors instruction given to the jury in the resentencing proceeding allowed him to be sentenced to life without parole without the jury ever having found that he personally committed the actus reus of the crime or intended the death of the victim or that the aggravating factors applied to him rather than to an accomplice. The instant court concluded that defendant's jury in the resentencing proceeding found that he personally committed all four aggravating factors as required. The instructions left no chance, as there was in defendant's first trial, that the jurors could have answered yes if they thought an accomplice, rather than defendant, committed the aggravating factors. The jury instructions in this case met the constitutional requirements of due process and right to trial by jury. The trial court properly empaneled defendant's jury at resentencing pursuant to Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 6.1. Defendant was resentenced on the basis of jury findings regarding aggravating factors; therefore, double jeopardy protections did not attach. The trial court's decision to reject defendant's Batson challenge was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The King County Superior Court, Washington, granted petitioner supplier's motion for summary judgment on respondent worker's strict product liability claim. The Washington Court of Appeals reversed. On remand, the trial court dismissed the worker's claims. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a prior case required retroactive application of strict product liability to the worker's action. The supplier petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supplier claimed the supreme court readopted selective prospectivity by implicitly overruling Robinson. However, the supreme court did not purport to overrule Robinson in any other case. Therefore, selectively prospective application of strict liability was not an option. In accordance with Robins, strict product liability now applied retroactively to all claims against manufacturers and suppliers of products. Because the supreme court applied strict product liability to the litigants before the supreme court in prior cases, strict product liability also applied to all subsequent claims against manufacturers and suppliers of products not barred by procedural requirements, regardless of whether those claims arose prior or subsequent to the supreme court's adoption of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, &sect; 402A (1965). It followed that strict product liability applied to the worker's claim as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioner appealed a judgment of the Thurston County Superior Court, Washington, finding the charges in his petition to recall two port commissioners to be legally insufficient to submit to voters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner alleged the commissioners committed malfeasance because they approved expenditures and a lease without a comprehensive scheme of harbor improvements as required under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 53.20.010. Petitioner also alleged that one of the commissioners approved a lease without first subjecting it to review under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). The court found these charges insufficient. Contrary to petitioner's position, the statute and case law appeared to allow a port commission considerable discretion in the creation of a comprehensive scheme of harbor improvements. The commissioners' failure to establish a comprehensive scheme titled as such and limited to one document did not constitute malfeasance. The charge that one of the commissioners intended to violate SEPA was factually and legally insufficient because there was no evidence the commissioner intended to violate SEPA by approving the lease, and the port's issuance of a mitigated determination of non-significance provided legal justification for the commissioner's actions. The court also found the statutes governing the recall process, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 29A.56.110-29A.56.140, to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Spokane County Superior Court, Washington, convicted defendant of first degree burglary and second degree robbery, among other counts. The State sought a persistent offender sentence under Washington's &quot;three strikes&quot; law. Because defendant did not have two prior superior court convictions for most serious offenses, standard range concurrent sentences were imposed. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed. The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended the appellate court erred in affirming the trial court's determination that the State failed to prove that one of defendant's prior convictions counted as a strike for purposes of persistent offender status. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the State did not meet its burden of showing that defendant was convicted as an &quot;offender&quot; at the time of the prior conviction in question because there was no evidence in the record that the superior court had jurisdiction over defendant. This was critical because to classify defendant as an &quot;offender,&quot; the State had to show that defendant was convicted of an automatic decline charge or that the juvenile court declined jurisdiction. The juvenile court had jurisdiction over the second degree robbery charge and there was no evidence before the sentencing judge indicating that a declination hearing occurred. By failing to establish the existence of a declination hearing in juvenile court, the State could not show that defendant was convicted as an &quot;offender&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.030(37)(a)(ii). Therefore, defendant could not be sentenced as a persistent offender.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the convictions on the ground that assault could not serve as the predicate felony for felony murder. On appeal, the court held that double jeopardy clauses of the Fifth Amendment and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 did not bar defendants' retrial because: (1) defendants' convictions were reversed due to the invalidity of the charge, not insufficient evidence, as assault could not be the underlying offense for felony murder; (2) defendants were not impliedly acquitted of second-degree intentional murder because their juries had no opportunity to consider their factual innocence of that charge; and (3) the court rejected defendants' contention that jeopardy terminated when the jury was discharged without returning an express verdict on the intentional murder alternative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original action for mandamus, petitioner state senator sought to compel respondent lieutenant governor to forward S.B. 6931, 60th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2008) to the state house of representatives. Petitioner also requested a declaratory judgment invalidating the supermajority requirement of Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because S.B. 6931 was a tax initiative, &sect; 43.135.035(1) required a two-thirds majority of each house for passage of the bill. As the president of the state senate, the lieutenant governor was asked to rule on a point of order by a second senator, who argued that S.B. 9631 required two-thirds approval; petitioner asked the lieutenant governor to rule that only a simple majority was required. The lieutenant governor ruled that a two-thirds majority was required; S.B. 6931 did not pass. The court dismissed the action as a mandamus action was inappropriate under Wash. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4. Although the constitution did not have a formal separation of powers clause under Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 1; art. III, &sect; 2; art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the King County Superior Court, Washington, with possession of methamphetamine. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.36.055, a law allowing King County to divide itself into two superior court jury districts, although he did not move for a jury panel drawn from the county as a whole. The superior court upheld the statute's constitutionality. Defendant appealed the superior court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the legislature, in enacting &sect; 2.36.055, violated the right to a jury trial in criminal prosecutions when it allowed the county, which had two superior courthouses, to divide itself into two jury districts. According to defendant, the requirement in Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22, that juries be &quot;of the county&quot; meant juries must be of the whole county. The instant court concluded that the legislature had the plenary power to enact &sect; 2.36.055. Defendant also, in essence, brought a facial challenge to the statute's constitutionality and its implementation under the U.S. Constitution by alleging that the populations of the two jury districts varied based on income, home ownership, and education. Assuming this was true, as a facial matter, defendant did not carry his burden of showing that these demographic differences amounted to a systemic exclusion of a distinctive group. Based on the scant factual record of the actual makeup of the jury source lists and without prejudice to a future challenge, the instant court declined to substantively consider this unripe claim. Defendant failed to show that the statute was unconstitutional as written or as applied in his case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed an original action, seeking a writ of mandamus to compel respondent Washington Secretary of State to accept petitions submitted for Initiative Measure No. 1029 (I-1029) as petitions for an initiative to the legislature. Petitioners conversely asked to prohibit the Secretary of State from certifying I-1029 as an initiative to the people for placement on the general election ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initiative petition was flawed. To the extent it was meant to be a petition for an initiative to the people, it lacked a subtitle as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29A.72.120 indicating that it was to be submitted to the People, but to the extent it was supposed to be an initiative to the legislature, it failed to meet the requirements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29A.72.110 by not prominently announcing that it was to be submitted to the legislature. The court concluded that the Secretary of State had a reasoned basis to accept the petitions as supporting an initiative to the people, notwithstanding the erroneous language in the petitions. The initiative petition was ambiguous in that it could be interpreted as supporting either an initiative to the people or an initiative to the legislature. The initiative's sponsor clearly intended an initiative to the people when she checked the corresponding box on the petition application form, and the Secretary acknowledged that intent in processing and numbering the initiative as one to the people. The Secretary's decision to file the petitions as an initiative to the people, as the sponsor intended, was not arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for writ of mandamus was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Stevens County Superior Court, Washington, granted respondent school district's motion for summary judgment on appellant employee's Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 49.60, claim, finding there was no issue of material fact regarding whether the employee was disabled. The trial judge denied the employee's motion for reconsideration. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question before the supreme court was whether the legislature's retroactive amendment of a statute it had already construed violated separation of powers. The district argued that the retroactive application of the legislature's statutory definition of &quot;disability&quot; in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.040(25) violated separation of powers by allowing the legislature to effectively overrule the supreme court's decision in another case and act as a court of last resort. The supreme court found that the legislature exercised its authority to amend the WLAD and change the definition of &quot;disability&quot; retroactively. The legislature was careful not to reverse the supreme court's decision nor did it interfere with any judicial function. It did not threaten the independence or integrity or invade the prerogatives of the judicial branch. The adoption of S.S.B. 5340, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.040(25)(a), did not violate the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI). At her bench trial, the State argued that if the trial court did not find her guilty of DUI, it should convict her of the lesser included offense of being in physical control of a vehicle while under the influence in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.504. Defendant argued that physical control while under the influence is not a lesser included offense of DUI because both offenses are gross misdemeanors subject to the same penalties. The instant court held that being in physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is an included offense of DUI. There is no requirement under Washington law that an offense carry a potential penalty that is less than the charged crime in order to be an included offense for which a defendant may be convicted, even if not charged.</SPAN></P>

Although defendant conceded that one of the prior convictions was an element of the crime of felony communication with a minor for immoral purposes, he argued that the trial should be bifurcated so that a jury would decide whether there had been communications with a minor for immoral purposes, but the trial judge would make a determination on the prior conviction element. The court concluded that defendant was not entitled to a bifurcated trial, and that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in denying defendant's motion to bifurcate. The court noted that if a prior conviction is an element of the crime charged, evidence of its existence would not be not irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

Honorable Frank E Cuthbertson.<BR>In re Pers. Restraint of Bonds, 141 Wn. App. 1032, 2007 Wash. App. LEXIS 3078 (2007)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington Court of Appeals applied equitable tolling to allow petitioner inmate to amend his personal restraint petition (PRP) more than one year after his judgment and sentence became final. The appellate court granted relief, vacated the inmate's convictions, and ordered a new trial. The State petitioned for discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court was asked to determine whether, under the facts of this case, it would recognize equitable tolling as an exception to the time bar provided under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090 and permit the inmate to submit an otherwise untimely amended PRP. The instant court concluded that equitable tolling did not apply. The inmate did not meet the high burden of demonstrating that his amended PRP was untimely due to bad faith, deception, or false assurances. Although the inmate contended that equitable tolling should apply because the trial court's inaction in reviewing his PRP to determine its merit left him in a situation where his counsel, once appointed, could not discover the issue whether his right to a public trial was violated until after the statute of limitation had run, the instant court noted that there is no right to counsel in postconviction collateral attacks. Moreover, nothing prevented the inmate from timely asserting the public trial issue himself. Applying equitable tolling in this case would undercut finality of judgments, encourage untimely filing and amendments to collateral attacks, and unjustifiably expand the narrow equitable tolling exception.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's judgment was reversed, and the inmate's convictions were reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wind energy company filed an application with Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC) for site certification of a wind power project. The court first determined that it had appellate jurisdiction under the certification procedures established in the Washington Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 80.50.140, and that Wash. Const. art. IV was not violated by conferring unauthorized original jurisdiction. The petitions for review met the conditions under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 80.50.140(1), and therefore the court accepted certification from the superior court. Because EFSLA provided no procedures for how the governor could exercise her discretion to approve or reject the application, the court looked to the APA, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.05.570(3), for the scope of review. EFSEC's preemption power did not violate the Growth Management Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.70A. EFSEC members did not violate the appearance of fairness doctrine. And finally, substantial evidence supported EFSEC's decision to preempt the County's land use and zoning laws based on the criteria under former Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 463-28-040.</SPAN></P>
