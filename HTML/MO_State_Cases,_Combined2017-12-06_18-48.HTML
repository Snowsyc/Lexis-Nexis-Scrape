<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The trial court properly determined that the four tweets did not constitute &quot;true threats,&quot; and, therefore, were improperly criminalized because they facially revealed that they were made in the context of sports rivalry, an area subject to impassioned language and hyperbole; while defendant's references to pressure cookers and allusions to the Boston Marathon bombing were tasteless and offensive, the context of his tweets was such that a reasonable recipient would not interpret them as serious expressions of an intent to commit violence; [2]-Even if the trial court had dismissed the information without prejudice, the State's refiling of the information charging defendant with violating Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 574.115 (Supp. 2000) on the basis of the same tweets would be a futile act given that the court previously held that the tweets were not threats prohibited by the statute.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 29 to bargain collectively with its employees, it could adopt an ordinance requiring an election to designate a collective bargaining representative even if a union obtained signature cards from a majority of the employees; [2]-Excluding supervisory employees from a bargaining unit did not conflict with the constitutional right to organize, was consistent with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 105.510 (2000), and did not require the city to establish a dispute-resolution procedure; [3]-The city could prohibit the same labor organization from representing both non-supervisory and supervisory employees; [4]-The circuit court violated separation of powers under Mo.

Alabama/Jackson v. Hobbs applied retroactively to cases on collateral review, including the present case; while it was constitutionally permissible to sentence a juvenile homicide offender to LWOP, a mandatory imposition of a LWOP sentence was unconstitutional since it was prohibited by the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 490.220 (2000) must nonetheless be relevant as a condition of its admissibility; [3]-The car company never addressed the legal relevance of the report, and the trial court's erroneous conclusion that it was compelled to admit the ODI report without first assessing the report's logical and legal relevance required reversal because it resulted in prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 231.010(4) (2000), as he had a severe back injury he sustained while working, plus he was terminated, as he was informed he was not able to perform the functions of his role and no accommodation could be made, and a discharge letter set out plainly that he was discharged due to his back injury; [2]-The sole basis for discharging the worker was a draft document that set forth permanent restrictions, which was unsigned and over seven years old, and the jury could have found that the employer acted outrageously, such that the evidence was sufficient to submit the claim for punitive damages under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 213.111.2 (2000) to the jury.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.020(2) (2000), requiring life without parole for a juvenile offender convicted of first-degree murder, because the Missouri Supreme Court had decided the issue; [3]-The imposition of defendant's life without parole (LWOP) sentence violated the Eighth Amendment because the sentencer did not consider his youth and other characteristics required by Miller; [4]-On remand, his prior waiver of jury sentencing was not binding because he did not consider if he would prefer a judge or jury to make the qualitatively different decision Miller required.</SPAN></P>

V or VI; [3]-The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's perjury conviction under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 575.040.1 (2000) where the sole purpose of the protective custody hearing was to determine the existence of defendant's son, and therefore her statements denying she had a son were material under &sect; 575.040.2.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 319.131.5 (2000 &amp; Cum.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 538.305 required that the cap be applied to the award of punitive damages to the city; the trial court erred in failing to limit the punitive damages awarded to five times the net amount of the judgment entered against the Fund.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 386.890 and its associated regulations; [2]-Because the plain language of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.110 was limited to actions by boards of adjustment, and the city's denial of a special use permit (SUP) application was not made by a board of adjustment, it was reviewable under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 rather than &sect; 89.110 and thus the applicants' appeal was not untimely; [3]-As the city had not otherwise appealed the conclusion that the denial of the SUP application was arbitrary and capricious, the trial court's judgment in favor of the applicants on this issue would be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The plain meaning of a city's red light camera ordinance was to prohibit running red lights, despite its semantics prohibiting presence in the intersection during a red light; therefore, the ordinance regulated the same conduct as Mo.

The security officer was a person who assisted in the reception of persons requiring immediate medical care, and in facilitating their treatment, where required because of the unruly nature of the patient, or others who might be present. Plainly, he fell within the category of &quot;emergency room personnel,&quot; and was thus &quot;emergency personnel&quot; for purposes of &sect; 565.082.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.071 was not unconstitutional as there was no constitutional right to a jury determination respecting the transfer of a juvenile's court case to a court of general jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

There was no case suggesting that counsel was ineffective for not challenging a law presumed to be constitutional and upheld in the only reported challenge to its constitutionality.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court properly dismissed the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim where the faculty member failed to plead sufficient facts showing that her reassignment and the decisions in her grievance violated the faculty handbook and were wrongful under her contract. Specifically, she failed to identify the reassignment, the grievance, and how that grievance process violated the faculty handbook or was otherwise wrongful. The complaint also failed to allege the express contract terms that the university board supposedly misused in bad faith. The declaratory judgment count was also properly dismissed because even if Missouri's Administrative Procedure Act applied, circuit court review did not include the power of equity or of declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of dismissal was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cape Girardeau County (Missouri) that denied his petition for the removal of a fence that was erected by a company in an alley at the rear of the owner's property pursuant to respondent city's buffer ordinance. The petition claimed a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 through the city's inverse condemnation of his property pursuant to Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 26.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that the trial court misapplied the city's buffer ordinance and that he was entitled to reasonable attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The court held that the city's requirement of the fence was due to a misapplication of its buffer ordinance. The public use of the alley had changed in that the company used the alley as part of its drive-through and part of its yard in order to comply with the ordinance requiring a 25-foot rear yard. Since the fence was not mandated by an applicable valid ordinance and the city provided no other notice to the owner or opportunity to be heard, the city failed to ensure the owner's procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment in the exercise of its police power. The city unreasonably restricted the owner's right of access to the alley as an abutting property owner by approving the erection of the fence in its current location, which amounted to inverse condemnation of the property. The owner was entitled to ejectment of the fence under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 524.010 (2010) and to nominal damages. Since the owner was a prevailing party on his &sect; 1983 claim, he was entitled to reasonable attorney's fees under &sect; 1988(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of the owner's reasonable attorney's fees and to enter judgment in accordance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, he filed a pro se Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035 postconviction relief motion alleging that the State had not provided a sufficient factual basis for the charge, as required under Mo. Sup. Ct.

The appellate court found that even assuming that the State did not provide a factual basis for the plea, defendant did not show that he lacked actual knowledge of the factual basis for the charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) in favor of respondent, the city's police union, ordering the city to establish a framework for collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union asserted that the city had an affirmative duty, under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 29, to establish a meaningful framework of procedures allowing city law enforcement employees to bargain collectively with the city. The court first determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the union had standing to sue on behalf of the police officers. In addition to union cards, the record contained sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that the union did in fact exist and represented its members. The court next concluded that the police officers' constitutional right of collective bargaining implied a corresponding duty of the city to facilitate the exercise of that right. The city's suggestion that it had no duty to engage with employee representatives rendered meaningless those rights guaranteed to city employees under article I, &sect; 29. The court noted that most elements of the trial court's order comported with the separation of powers doctrine. It did decide, however, to transfer the case to the Missouri Supreme Court under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 83.02 given the general interest and importance of the questions presented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri), which convicted and sentenced him to consecutive life sentences for child kidnapping under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.115 (Cum. Supp. 2006), forcible rape under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.030 (Cum. Supp. 2006), and two counts of forcible sodomy under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.060 (Cum. Supp. 2006), all committed against a minor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before closing arguments commenced, the trial court ruled that defense counsel would not be allowed to argue that defendant's brother had committed the crimes.  Defendant claimed that the trial court abused its discretion because: (1) he and his brother looked alike; (2) his brother lived near the victim's grandmother and regularly visited the grandmother; (3) on the day prior to the abduction and assault, the brother had gone to the burnt house where the sexual assaults took place; (4) his brother frequented the residence from which victim had been abducted; and 5) the State's DNA evidence did not eliminate his brother, who shared a common paternal lineage with defendant. The court upheld the decision. Although all of this evidence was admitted at trial and could properly be used by defendant to cast doubt on the strength of the State's case against defendant by diluting the DNA evidence and calling into question the reliability of the victim's identification, specifically arguing that his brother was the true perpetrator of the crimes would have impermissibly extended beyond the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The natural gas corporation demanded reimbursement for its estimated cost to relocate its utility lines. The county sought a declaration that the corporation had to relocate its lines at its own expense. The trial court properly awarded summary judgment to the county. Under the common-law rule, the corporation had to pay for relocating the lines. The corporation's utility easements did not predate the public right-of-way. The subdivision plats dedicated certain streets for public use and then designated the streets as a &quot;utility easement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) granted the State's motion to dismiss. Inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inmate argued, inter alia, that the State has violated his Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, privilege against self incrimination because it conditioned eligibility for conditional release and good-time credits on an inmate's successful completion of the Missouri Sex Offender Program, which in turn required an admission of guilt concerning the inmate's sexual offenses. The court of appeals disagreed. The requirement that inmate admit his responsibility for the sexual offenses of which he was convicted as a condition for successful completion of the MoSOP did not violate his Fifth Amendment rights. The consequences for failure to complete the MoSOP did not constitute an &quot;atypical or significant hardship,&quot; and the program -- including the requirement that participants admit their guilt for the sexual offenses for which they were convicted -- furthered the legitimate penological objective of rehabilitating sex offenders and reducing their risk of recidivism.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The record showed that the venirepersons were questioned regarding pre-trial publicity during voir dire. Prospective jurors were specifically asked whether anyone had heard of the case, either through word of mouth, media, radio, or newspaper. Only two prospective jurors responded that they had heard of the case. One venireperson responded that she heard about the case through word of mouth, but did not know any of the specifics of the case. Another prospective juror responded that he read about the case and discussed it at work. Both of those prospective jurors were struck for cause. Defendant presented no evidence that any of the members of the jury panel selected to hear his case were aware of any pre-trial publicity or that any of the jurors had such fixed opinions regarding the case that they could not impartially determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, granted judgment in favor of respondent inmate by denying recovery by appellant State under the Missouri Incarceration Reimbursement Act (MIRA), Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 217.825 through 217.841 (2000). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued the trial court erred in entering judgment for the inmate because the inmate failed to rebut the State's prima facie case in that the State presented evidence showing the inmate was incarcerated in a Missouri correctional facility and that he had assets subject to MIRA because he owned a home worth at least $87,600 and the inmate presented no evidence. The appellate court noted that the State did not object to the trial court's use of the inmate's response as evidence at the hearing, just as the inmate did not object to the State's use of the county assessor's value to establish the value of the property. The State's ability to determine whether prior liens existed that took priority over a potential MIRA judgment was absolutely necessary to achieve the purpose of MIRA to restrict the State using its limited resources to pursue actions only against those offenders with sufficient assets to pay a statutorily set minimum amount. The question that had to be considered was whether there were assets to be seized at all in connection with a homestead before a good cause determination could be made, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.835.4.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of St. Charles County (Missouri), which convicted him of involuntary manslaughter in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion to quash the search warrants and when it allowed the search and seizure of his blood and urine samples, and the System Diagnostic Module (SDM) in his vehicle. Defendant also argued the trial court erred when it allowed evidence of the data and information resulting from the seizures because the actual searches violated Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43.200 (2000) and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 542.286.2 (2002). The court upheld the decision. First, it found no connection between Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43.200 (2000) and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 542.286.2 (2002) because &sect; 542.286 addressed the territorial jurisdiction of the judge, the court, and the officer serving the warrant and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43.200 (2000) simply authorized the Highway Patrol to request that a prosecutor apply for a search warrant and that a member of the Highway Patrol serve a search warrant anywhere within the State. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in allowing the State to elicit testimony regarding his alleged lack of remorse because the evidence was prejudicial, but the issue was not properly preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

Defendant jabbed the knife toward the victim's stomach while demanding her purse. She positively identified defendant as the robber during the photo lineup and again at trial. The victim's eyewitness testimony alone was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for first-degree robbery. The victim's testimony that defendant used a steak knife with a serrated blade to commit the robbery was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that forcible stealing had occurred. The victim's testimony that defendant displayed and threatened to use the knife was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that defendant used a dangerous instrument during the course of the robbery. The surveillance videotape showed that the car was used during the robbery. When police located the car four hours later parked in front of a house, defendant was found inside. He attempted to flee when police entered the residence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land title companies sought review of a summary judgment from the Circuit Court of Webster County (Missouri), which ruled that respondent county recorder did not violate the Sunshine Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 610.010 et seq. (2000), by charging fees for electronic copies of land records that exceeded the actual cost of reproducing those records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recorder charged less than one dollar per page. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 59.310.6(2) (Supp. 2001) allowed a recorder to charge up to the maximum amount therein provided for copies of recorded instruments, regardless of the Sunshine Law's fee restrictions as set forth in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 610.026.1 (Cum. Supp. 2004). Because the fees charged to the companies were within the maximum limits provided for in &sect; 59.310.6(2), which controlled over the &sect; 610.026.1 actual-cost limitation, the fees were lawful. Applying the definitions in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 59.005 (Supp. 2001), the court construed the term &quot;recorded instrument&quot; in &sect; 59.310.6(2) as referring to the original instrument after being recorded; thus, it did not matter whether the record of that instrument maintained by the recorder was in electronic or paper format. The actual-cost restriction in &sect; 59.310.6(8) for duplicate copies applied only to second or subsequent copies. A claim of attempted unlawful privatization was moot. Fees greater than actual costs did not constitute an unauthorized tax under Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The denial of the county's motion for summary judgment was not reviewable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a workers' compensation proceeding, appellants, an employer and its insurer, appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) that found that Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 20-3.040 was constitutional and granted claimant attorneys' fees of $ 81,609.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued, inter alia, that the attorney fees were not supported by substantial and competent evidence and were against the weight of the evidence because the award was granted upon an &quot;offer of proof&quot; rather than an &quot;evidentiary hearing.&quot; The court of appeals disagreed. The trial court did not sustain appellants' objection to the evidence offered for attorney fees but rather acknowledged appellants' continuing objection to the application for attorney fees. The trial court granted claimant's motion for an evidentiary hearing on its request for attorney fees. At the hearing to acknowledge appellants' objection to the attorney fees, the trial court stated that it would hear the evidence first as an &quot;offer of proof&quot; before it heard arguments on the merits. During the hearing, appellants cross-examined the witnesses, challenged the evidence, adduced evidence, and argued against the authority and reasonableness of the requested fees. The trial court then took the matter with the case. Thus, the presentation of evidence was not an offer of proof but an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the trial court would grant claimant's application or dismiss it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant's request for attorney fees on appeal was granted and the case was remanded to the trial court for a hearing and judgment entered accordingly. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators hotels and motels (hotels) sought a writ of prohibition, injunction and declaratory judgment against respondent cities claiming that local ordinances enabling and enacting a transient guest tax were unconstitutional on their face because they violated Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Hotels argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying their claim for writ of prohibition because the ordinances were unconstitutional on their face, in violation of Art. X, Sec. 1 of the Missouri Constitution, in that pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 67.1003.2 (2008), cities were prohibited from imposing a tax on charges for sleeping rooms used by transient guests because the cities were located within St. Louis County, which already imposed such a tax. Appellants believed the language prohibited a city from imposing the tourism tax under &sect; 67.1003 if a county was already imposing a tax on the sleeping rooms. The court of appeals disagreed. The court found that find that &sect;&sect; 67.1003.1 and 67.1003.2, read in pari materia, prohibited a city or county from levying a tax on sleeping rooms, only if that particular city or county was itself already levying a tax on those rooms pursuant to another authority. Here, neither city was currently levying a tax on sleeping rooms pursuant to any other authority and, therefore, they were free to place on the ballot an initiative to levy a tax on sleeping rooms pursuant to &sect; 67.1003 for the voters to decide.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the good-faith exception to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule did not extend to police officers' reliance on case law. The United States Supreme Court had never extended the good-faith exception to a police officer's reliance on appellate case law or the officer's training.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance following a search incident to her arrest for a driving offense. The Circuit Court of Howell County (Missouri) granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence discovered during the search, finding that the search violated her constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amend IV and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. The State filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer searched defendant's vehicle as an incident to arrest, which was in keeping with the well-settled precedent that an officer could search a vehicle incident to arrest. However, the law changed after defendant's arrest when the United States Supreme Court decided Arizona v. Gant, 129 S.Ct. 1710 (2009), and specifically held that police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only if the arrestee was within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it was reasonable to believe the vehicle contained evidence of the offense of arrest. There was no question that, under the new standard, the officer did not have the right to search defendant's vehicle. However, the court found that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied. The remedy, not the principle of retroactive application, was at issue. The benefits of applying the exclusionary rule were extremely low. The deterrent effect on officer misconduct was non-existent because there was no reckless or grossly negligent conduct. Because there was nothing to deter, social costs clearly outweighed the nonexistent deterrent benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court of Buchanan County (Missouri) to violating Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.147 (Cum. Supp. 2006), which prohibited convicted sexual offenders from residing within a thousand feet of a school or child care facility. On appeal, he argued that application of the 2004 statute to his prior conviction in 1999 violated the state's prohibition against retrospective application of the law, Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's constitutional issue was not irrevocably waived by the plea. Under the &quot;change of law&quot; principle, defendant was still able to raise a request for relief on the basis of his newly minted constitutional defense. The record did not show an express waiver of either the right to appeal generally, or waiver of the right to appeal the specific latent issue under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, as a key part of the plea agreement. The law changed while his case was on appeal, but before the judgment became final. The case F.R. v. St. Charles Cty. Sheriff's Dep't, held that a defendant's prior sexual conviction in 1999 pre-dated the enactment of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.147 and because the defendant was convicted and sentenced before the school residency law was enacted, &sect; 566.147 as applied to that defendant was unconstitutionally retrospective in its operation.

Defendants then filed a motion for leave to add the interpleader defendant, plaintiff's insurer, to the action and sought a declaration of ownership of the $ 151,323.83 in dispute. The Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri), found the insurer's lien was an invalid partial assignment of plaintiff's personal injury claim and sustained summary judgment in her favor. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's medical expenses were covered by an employee contributory self-funded health plan. The policy issued in plaintiff's case required her to agree that the insurer would have a lien on the proceeds recovered by or on behalf of plaintiff, to the extent of the amount of covered expenses that were paid or payable with respect to the sickness or injury the plaintiff sustained. However, Missouri public policy prohibited the transfer of a personal injury claim, in whole or part. The trial court found that the policy was similar to a subrogation right, which, absent a statute, was invalid as amounting to an assignment of a claim for personal injuries. The insurer was not a creditor and had no valid independent underlying cause of action against plaintiff. Plaintiff paid for health care coverage. The insurer was obligated to provide those benefits regardless of whether plaintiff pursued her personal injury claim. Missouri courts have never allowed a provider to be reimbursed for medical expenses that the insured recovers in a settlement from a liable third party under a lien theory. Thus, under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 74.04(c)(6), summary judgment was properly granted in plaintiff's favor.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that the inmate was serving a life sentence and had no specific conditional release date or entitlement to good time credit when Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 10-5.010 was promulgated. Where the inmate did not previously have a conditional release date or an entitlement to good time credit, the policy enunciated in Rule 10-5.010 did not affect a substantive right of the inmate. Section 558.041 and the policy in Rule 10-5.010 may properly be applied to the inmate without violating Missouri's ban on retrospective laws. The policy in Rule 10-5.010 was properly promulgated by means of the authority granted by the General Assembly. Nothing in &sect; 558.041 created an entitlement to time credit as the language in the statute was discretionary. There was no evidence that the judgment was not the result of independent reflection by the trial court. The inmate did not have standing to appeal the trial court's denial of two individuals' motions to intervene.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 409.5-502(a) (Cum. Supp. 2003). Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the Commissioner was biased and should have disqualified himself because he and the Secretary of State made public announcements that indicated he prejudged the case and he oversaw the Assistant Commissioner, who investigated and prosecuted the case. The appellate court noted that appellants only alleged that the Commissioner could not be fair and impartial because he was in charge of the Assistance Commissioner and the enforcement section of the division. All the bases raised by appellants for disqualification failed. The Missouri Securities Act allowed the Commissioner to publish any record concerning an action or violation of the Act if they determined it was necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 409.6-602(a)(3) (Cum. Supp. 2003). The fact that the Commissioner's Cease and Desist Order was unfavorable to appellants did not show bias. The Commissioner was acting pursuant to, and in compliance with, statutory requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Charges were filed against appellant employee by his employer, respondent Division of Corrections for the City of St. Louis. He received a four-day suspension. The employee appealed to the Civil Service Commission, which upheld his suspension. He then filed a petition for administrative review in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 (2000). The circuit court dismissed his petition and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was informed that the Commission's policy was to handle suspensions like his through a written review process, which did not include the procedural due process protections afforded in contested cases,  Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.110 (2000). Before the court, however, the City argued that it was actually a contested case and the employee failed to timely appeal the decision of the Commission as required by &sect; 536.110.1. On appeal, the court noted that it first had to determine whether the employee's case was a contested or non-contested case. It determined that the case was contested, as a hearing was required to safeguard the constitutionally-protected property interest of the employee's right to continued employment with the City. However, the Commission failed to followed the required procedures in the Missouri Administrative Procedure Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 536.010-.150 (2000), particularly those related to the conduct of the hearing in &sect; 536.070. The court found that the doctrine of quasi-estoppel prevented the City from contending that the employee waived his contested case hearing because it led him to believe he was only entitled to a non-contested written review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the City's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and it reversed and remanded the matter to the circuit court with orders to remand it to the Commission so the Commission could hear and decide the appeal in accordance with contested case procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle upon a highway without a valid license, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.020 (2000), and felony possession of a controlled substance, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.202 (2000) in the Circuit Court of Daviess County (Missouri). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the circuit court improperly admitted the evidence found during the search of his van because the arresting officer was not entitled to perform a vehicle search incident to defendant's arrest for driving without a valid license because defendant was secured in the patrol car at the time of the search, and it was not reasonable for the officer to believe that the vehicle would contain evidence relevant to the offense for which defendant had been arrested. The court of appeals agreed. Under the United States Supreme Court decision in Arizona v. Gant, a search of the passenger compartment of an automobile incident to the arrest of a vehicle occupant was lawful only when the arrestee was within reaching distance of his vehicle, he had not been secured, or when law enforcement had reason to believe that evidence of the offense for which the occupant had been arrested was likely to be found in the vehicle. Since none of these applied to defendant, the search of his van incident to his arrest for driving without a valid license, after he had been secured in the patrol car, was unlawful and the evidence obtained during the search was inadmissible on that basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Gasconade County, Missouri, granted summary judgment in favor of respondent city on appellant landowners' claim seeking a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief including a refund of past overpayments, and damages. The landowners alleged that the city charged them and others grossly excessive utility rates. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners argued that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of the city because the facts did not entitle the city to judgment as a matter of law in that they showed there was at least a dispute of material facts as to whether, the city increased utility fees in violation of the Hancock Amendment, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22, by setting charges at a level to increase the city's general revenue and to subsidize general government expenditures rather than to compensate for the provision of services. The appellate court found that the fees were based on the amount of services received and were only charged after the services were provided. Utility fees were not blanket billed to all residents of the city. Residents only paid for those services they used. It was unclear whether the object of the fee requirement was to generate revenue for the general fund. General issues of material fact existed with respect to whether the city had historically and exclusively provided the utilities. The landowners' failure to file a tax protest did not preclude their entitlement to other forms of relief requested in their petition. The city collector was not a party to the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Washington County (Missouri), which denied, without an evidentiary hearing, his Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035 motion for postconviction relief from his conviction and sentence in a trial court after pleading guilty of being a prior offender residing within 1,000 feet of a school or child care facility, in violation of Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant pled guilty to statutory rape in 1999 and registered as a sex offender. In 2004, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.147 was enacted. After a child welfare worker discovered movant living within 1,000 feet of a &quot;Head Start&quot; facility, movant pled guilty to violating R. 566.147. Movant alleged that the motion court erred in denying his motion because his conviction and sentence were in violation of constitutional prohibitions against retrospective laws as guaranteed by Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The appellate court agreed. In 1999 when movant pled guilty to statutory rape, no law forbade him from living within 1,000 feet of a school or day-care center. As &sect; 566.147 imposed a new obligation, duty, or disability upon movant restricting his choice of residency it changed the legal effect of his past conviction. Movant was required to take action, not previously required of him, based on his previous conviction or face a new criminal charge. As such, &sect; 566.147 violated the Missouri Constitution's prohibition against the retrospective application of laws and was unconstitutional as applied to movant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners requested a judgment declaring the assessment against the owners and other class members, consisting of all unit owners not served by elevators, illegal, invalid, and void. The court noted that the trial court never issued an order certifying a class such as that requested by the owners in their petition. Additionally, nothing in the record indicated that the unit owners proposed as part of the class received proper notice as required by Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 52.08(c)(2). The court reversed and held that because there was never proper class certification under Rule 52.08, the trial court erred when it extended the judgment to parties not named in the suit. Further, it was error under both Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 527.110 and Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 87.04 to extend the judgment to those unit owners not a party to the case. All unit owners not served by elevators were not made parties to the proceedings; however, any declaration made by the trial court affected these owners directly, and therefore, all owners without elevator access had an obvious interest in any judicial declaration regarding the elevators, rendering them an indispensable party to the trial-court proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother filed a motion to modify an administrative child support order entered pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.496 (1994). The Circuit Court of Cedar County (Missouri) entered a judgment permanently enjoining respondent, the Missouri Department of Social Services, Division of Child Support Enforcement (DCSE), from collecting child support from the mother. The DCSE appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the mother was unemployed at the time her children's father won custody in 1992, the trial court did not order her to pay any child support. In 1994, &sect; 454.496 authorized the DCSE to review existing child support orders and file motions to modify the orders, which the DCSE did in the mother's case. The modified order, requiring the mother to pay monthly support, was approved in 1995. The mother paid the support and took no action to challenge the validity of the DCSE administrative order until 2007. The trial court found in favor of the mother based on the fact that the approval procedure in &sect; 454.496.6 had been found unconstitutional. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court that the mother waived her right to challenge the validity of the 1995 administrative order by failing to timely assert a claim that the order was entered pursuant to a portion of &sect; 454.496 later held unconstitutional. Constitutional violations were waived if not raised at the earliest possible opportunity. In addition, the mother was estopped from attacking the administrative order because she accepted the burdens of the order for 12 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed. There was nothing in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.070(4) (2004) requiring the board to transcribe the proceedings for free. The plain language of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.130.4 (2000), made it the employee's responsibility to ensure the record was filed. Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 5.04 applied only to indigent civil litigants. The trial court had denied the employee's motion to proceed in forma pauperis and she did not expressly appeal that ruling. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the action for failure to prosecute. Finally, the trial court properly dismissed the board because it was not a proper party to the appeal. It did not have an independent role in the proceedings, only acted as an impartial hearing officer to conduct and decide the contested case, had no interest in the outcome of the case before it, and had no true interest in protecting its decision on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Missouri Real Estate Commission (MREC) revoked respondent realtor's license in reliance on Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 339.100.5. The realtor appealed the revocation to the Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission's (AHC), which decided that the realtor was entitled to retain his license. MREC appealed the AHC's decision. The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, affirmed the decision of the AHC. MREC appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When he was younger, the realtor went to prison for second degree murder. He was eventually released from prison and parole, enrolled in real estate school, and applied for a real estate salesperson's license. In his application, he disclosed his prior conviction. After a thorough investigation by MREC, the realtor was issued a license. Two or three years later, &sect; 339.100.5 took effect. In part, it provided that a salesperson's license would be revoked if the licensee had pled guilty to, entered a plea of nolo contendere to, or been found guilty of any dangerous felony. In analyzing the retroactive application of the statute, the court agreed with MREC that the realtor had no vested or substantial right to hold a real estate salesperson's license. Section 339.100.5 did, however, impermissibly impose a new obligation, duty, or disability on the realtor with respect to a past transaction in violation of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.  Section 339.100.5 could not be applied to require mandatory revocation of a license based solely on a criminal proceeding predating the statute's effective date, whether the person was licensed at the time of the criminal proceeding or not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother's boyfriend filed a petition for paternity. The trial court denied the boyfriend summary judgment, granted the same to respondent mother, found a proper chain of custody as to DNA test results under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.834 (2000), and granted her motion to rescind the mother's paternity acknowledgment. The boyfriend and third-party respondent father appealed. The Missouri Supreme Court transferred the case to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The boyfriend believed he was the father of the child. Tests were performed. The boyfriend sought a declaration that he was the child's legal father. The trial court found a proper chain of custody regarding the tests and rescinded the paternity acknowledgment, but the court reversed and remanded. Because the boyfriend failed to raise the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.834 (2000) at the first available opportunity, he did not preserve this issue for appellate review. The mother alleged that evidence was admissible under the procedure detailed in &sect; 210.834 and she was entitled to judgment, but there was no transcript documenting the evidence and argument made at hearings, which challenged the DNA evidence and chain of custody. It was impossible for the court to determine what evidence was before the trial court, the court would not speculate, and the court reversed and remanded for a trial on the merits. In the absence of a record establishing that there was an accurate and properly conducted DNA test under &sect; 210.834, the court was unable to determine whether the trial court erred in granting the motion to rescind the acknowledgment under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.823 (2000).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Kansas City Symphony (symphony) sought a declaration that respondent State was required to provide tax revenue funding for the Missouri Arts Council Trust Fund (Fund) and sought orders compelling the State and respondent legislature to comply with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 143.183.5 (2000 &amp; Cum. Supp. 2009). The Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) granted respondents' motion for judgment on the pleadings and the symphony sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the finding that the symphony's claims against the State and legislature were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and that the symphony's interpretation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 143.183.5 as mandating a transfer of funds from the general revenue fund without appropriation was unconstitutional,&nbsp;Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 36. The only &quot;contract&quot; was the incentive agreement between the symphony and the Board of Trustees for the Fund. This lawsuit was not filed against the Fund or its Trustees seeking enforcement of the alleged contract. The symphony's claim under &sect; 143.183.5 was directed against the State and the Legislature, but there was no indication that the contract was authorized or approved by the General Assembly. An implied waiver of immunity was limited to matters relating to the specific contract authorized. The incentive agreement did not reference &sect; 143.183.5, and the agreement specifically stated that the Trustees' donation of matching funds to those raised by the symphony was &quot;subject to appropriation.&quot; This wording was at odds with the symphony's bare assumption that &sect; 143.183.5 either mandated an appropriation or obviated the need for one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant realtor appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) finding that he violated plaintiff city's ordinance, City of Bellefontaine Neighbors, Mo., &sect; 112.4(a), Ordinance No. 2057, by marketing residential property without first applying for a certificate of building code compliance, and imposing a fine of $ 100 plus costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realtor argued that City of Bellefontaine Neighbors, Mo., &sect; 112.4(a), Ordinance No. 2057, was unconstitutional and violated Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 67.317 (2000). The court agreed. First, the commercial speech that the city sought to regulate, namely real estate advertising, concerned a lawful activity and was not misleading. Second, the city's asserted governmental interest in safe housing was substantial. But the city failed to establish that the ordinance directly advanced the governmental interest asserted and that it was not more extensive than was necessary to serve that interest. Other sections of the ordinance already required an owner to achieve code compliance and obtain a certificate thereof prior to transferring ownership or possession. Lacking any relation to its stated purpose, the city's regulation was thus inevitably more extensive than necessary to serve its interest in safe housing and violated the First Amendment. In addition, it violated &sect; 67.317 because that statute prohibited municipalities from restricting the right of homeowners and their agents to erect signs advertising real property for sale except as to sign size.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant movant, a juvenile, pleaded guilty when he was 15 years old to child kidnapping, forcible sodomy, first-degree assault, and attempted forcible rape which he committed at the age of 13. There was no plea agreement with respondent State of Missouri. The Missouri Circuit Court of St. Louis County denied his Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing. The movant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The movant admitted that he kidnapped a six-year-old child, sexually assaulted her by railroad tracks, and beat her so severely that she suffered extensive injuries. The plea court found that he was not an appropriate candidate for sentencing within the juvenile system under the dual-jurisdiction law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.073 (2000). The plea court considered the victim's desire that the movant be sent away for 60 years and sentenced him to consecutive terms totalling 60 years. The court rejected the movant's post-conviction claims that his 60-year sentence constituted an unconstitutional and excessive punishment for a 13 year old and that plea counsel was ineffective for pressuring the movant to plead guilty. First, the court could not say that a 60-year sentence shocked the moral sense of all reasonable people when the maximum sentence was four consecutive life sentences. Further, the plea court did not act arbitrarily in allowing the victim impact statement to guide the sentencing decision in part. Second, the movant's claims that he did not understand the consequences of a blind plea and that counsel told him he would be sentenced as a juvenile were refuted by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) with involuntary manslaughter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals found that the State was not allowed to file an interlocutory appeal. The issue was whether the trooper acted in bad faith in disposing of evidence. To determine whether the trooper was acting in bad faith, the defense requested information on department procedures that would be relevant to the disposal of evidence. Despite repeated discovery requests for the department procedure that authorized the release of a vehicle in the fashion conducted by the trooper, the State failed or refused to provide the relevant documents. Instead, the State provided over fifty pages of irrelevant, or only marginally relevant, department procedure and policy excerpts. It was only after it became clear that the documents that the State finally produced did not include the policy that the trooper referenced that the trial court issued its order excluding evidence obtained from the vehicle. The trial court's order, therefore, was a discovery sanction and not a ruling to &quot;suppress&quot; illegally obtained evidence. A discovery sanction was not appealable by the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimants sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Missouri), which dismissed their medical malpractice action against respondent doctor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six years after filing their original medical malpractice action, the claimants voluntarily dismissed it without prejudice. Within the one-year savings period provided by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.230 (2000), the claimants filed a new petition containing nearly identical allegations. More than 180 days after filing their new petition, the claimants submitted a health care affidavit. The trial court dismissed the action without prejudice on the doctor's motion because the health care affidavit was untimely filed under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 538.225 (Cum. Supp. 2005). Because the new petition was filed after the operative date of amendments to &sect; 538.225 as set forth in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 538.305 (Cum. Supp. 2005) and the previously dismissed action was a nullity, the court held that the 2005 amendments were applicable. In any event, because &sect; 538.225 was a procedural statute,&nbsp;Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 did not prohibit its retrospective application. Section 538.225.6 made dismissal mandatory when a timely affidavit was not filed. The expiration of the limitations period to file a new suit did not convert a dismissal without prejudice under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 67.01 into a dismissal with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A psychologist treated the adoptive father, who was sexually abusing his daughter, without reporting the abuse to authorities as required by Mo.

The psychologist did not inform the authorities of the abuse or inform the adoptive mother or daughter that the father terminated therapy or warn them that he was likely to continue the abuse. The abuse continued. After the victim reported the abuse and the father was arrested, the victim filed suit against the psychologist, and after lengthy procedural happenings, received a judgment against him. The judgment was reversed as to damages only and was remanded with directions to the conduct a new trial limited on damages. On review of the new judgment, the court held that the trial court erred in awarding damages as assessed in a prior arbitration hearing against the psychologist. The case had been remanded with specific instructions to conduct a new trial on the issue of damages; the trial court lacked authority to assess damages in any other manner in the absence of the psychologist's agreement to waive his right to a new trial on damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant quarry owners sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which, in a jury trial, awarded both compensatory and punitive damages to respondent city in a public nuisance suit. The trial court declared that an ordinance limiting commercial truck traffic, Greenwood, Mo., City Code &sect; 397.065, was valid and enforceable under Missouri law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trucks transporting crushed rock from a quarry to state highways passed through a residential area in the city. The city presented evidence of dust, traffic, safety concerns, and road damage. The court held that the city's petition was adequate and that a submissible case for public nuisance regarding a public street did not require a physical obstruction. Although some residents were more affected than others, the nuisance was not a private nuisance. There was sufficient evidence of the quarry's control over its trucking contractor and its interference with residents' use of the road. Neither Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 304.170.10 (Cum. Supp. 2005) nor the definition of &quot;highway&quot; in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 301.010(19) (Cum. Supp. 2005) prevented cities from restricting truck access to their roads, and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 304.120.2(4) (Cum. Supp. 2005) provided such authority. Mo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 29 was not implicated because an alternate route to state highways was available. The city's claims were not compulsory counterclaims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a)(1)(A) to the owners' federal action asserting breach of contract and Commerce Clause claims. Punitive damages were adequately pleaded and proved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in all aspects, except as to the calculation of post-judgment interest, which the city had conceded was based on an erroneous rate. The court remanded to the trial court for calculation of post-judgment interest at the correct rate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clinic provided first-trimester medical abortion services. The clinic sought clarification from respondents as to whether it was required to be licensed under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.200 (Cum. Supp. 2008). Respondents replied that it would have to obtain a license and comply with the regulations. The clinic brought an action in federal court, seeking a declaration that &sect; 197.200 violated the federal constitution. The federal court set a trial date and ordered the parties to participate in mediation. The clinic then filed an action in state court, seeking a declaration that the statute did not require facilities that provided only medical abortions and performed no surgical procedures to be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers. The trial court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly dismissed the action as being duplicative and barred by the doctrine of abatement, as well as the fact that the clinic had an existing adequate remedy in federal court. Under the federal court's ruling on the abstention issue, it would definitely be determining whether &sect; 197.200 applied to the clinic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition for detention and evaluation, seeking custody of the patient as a sexually violent predator. The trial court found probable cause to support the petition. The patient then filed a motion to declare Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.495 (Cum. Supp. 2006), as amended, unconstitutional. The patient filed a motion to dismiss for failure to comply with the statutory procedures of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.484 (Cum. Supp. 2006). The trial court denied these motions, and the matter proceeded to a bench trial. The trial court entered its judgment, finding the patient to be a sexually violent predator. The appellate court ruled that the patient's challenge to the constitutional validity of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.495 was not real and substantial, in that it did not present an issue of first impression and therefore, was deemed merely colorable. The issue had been resolved by the Missouri Supreme Court. The clear and convincing burden of proof enunciated in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.495 (Cum. Supp. 2006) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for two counts of murder in the first degree, but the appellate court affirmed, stating that the evidence was sufficient. Being present at the time of the murder was not an element of murder in the first degree and, in any event, sufficient circumstantial evidence was presented to allow a reasonable juror to have found that defendant was present. His fingerprint was found on the trunk of the victim's car and defendant's phone bill and other items were found in the victim's car. In regard to defendant's Batson challenges, the prosecutor provided race-neutral reasons and the trial court was in the best position to determine their validity. Any error in the admission of an autopsy report and a doctor's testimony about its contents was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the conclusion reached in the autopsy report was not a disputed issue. His argument that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress was defective since he failed to identify with particularity the evidence he claimed was erroneously admitted and failed to state whether he objected to its admission at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county commissioners appealed a summary judgment from the Circuit Court of Franklin County (Missouri), which found them jointly and severally liable in their individual capacities for repaying unlawful pay increases that they had received. The trial court also ordered the commissioners to pay the attorney fees incurred by plaintiff taxpayers in bringing the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioners each received two pay increases pursuant to a statute that was later declared to be unconstitutional. They did not return the money after an audit report identified the payments as unlawful. More than five years after the second pay increase, but less than five years after the issuance of the audit report, the taxpayers filed a petition on behalf of the county seeking to recover the payments. The court stated that the five-year statute of limitations in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.120.2 (2000) applied where more than one public official was named as a defendant and the cause of action was based upon the officials' violation of, or failure to follow, the law. The cause of action accrued pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.100 (2000) when the last item of damage resulting therefrom was sustained and was capable of ascertainment. The last item of damage was the second pay increase. Although the taxpayers contended that they did not actually discover the damage until the audit report was issued, their suit was untimely because they could have discovered the pay increases earlier. Because the action was time-barred, the taxpayers were not entitled to recover their attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While appellant mother and appellee partner lived together, they each gave birth to a child. After the parties' relationship ended, the mother filed a petition for a declaration of maternity, for an order of custody, and for an order of child support related to the parties' minor children. Ultimately, the Circuit Court of Boone County, Missouri, dismissed the mother's petition. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the mother raised several issues contending the trial court erred in dismissing her petition. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that because there was no dispute as to the identity of each child's natural mother, the mother did not have standing to bring suit to declare a mother-child relationship under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826.2 (2000). Even assuming for the sake of argument that the mother did stand in loco parentis to the former partner's child while the mother and the former partner lived together, that status terminated when they separated and would have deprived the mother of standing to bring her action. Equitable estoppel could not be a basis for standing or affirmative relief under the existing pleadings of the case as the mother was not able to articulate a recognized legal bases for establishing her parental relationship with the former partner's child and the former partner's relationship with the mother's child. The mother also did not have standing under the exceptional circumstances doctrine to initiate an action seeking custody or visitation when she filed her petition or at the time the former partner filed her motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Counsel testified that movant provided witness names, but no contact information; counsel tried to find the first anyway, but could not. Indeed, the record indicated that counsel could not even reach movant, who missed scheduled meetings and did not reschedule them or provide information through other means. As a result, counsel could not meaningfully communicate with movant from the day he bonded out of jail until 7 a.m. the morning of trial. The other witness disclaimed knowledge about any of the allegedly forged checks; of any agreement about the victim's bank account or that movant could write checks thereon whenever he wished; or of any partnership discussions between the victim and movant. Thus, the trial court did not clearly err in finding that such testimony did not unequivocally support movant's defense that he was authorized to write and cash the fifteen checks allegedly forged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, convicted defendant on several counts of first and second degree attempted statutory rape, first and second degree statutory sodomy, first and second degree child molestation, and attempted victim tampering; he was sentenced to concurrent sentences on the sexual offenses, to run consecutively to concurrent sentences for the tampering convictions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the State presented insufficient evidence to support his convictions for first and second degree statutory sodomy, and the trial court erred when it admitted a victim's hearsay statements to her aunt. The appellate court agreed in part, finding that defendant's conduct of touching a victim's vagina through her clothing constituted sexual contact, not deviate sexual intercourse, and thus did not support the first degree statutory sodomy conviction. However, another's victim's testimony that defendant put his penis in that victim's hand supported the second degree statutory sodomy conviction. The trial court did not err when it admitted a victim's statements to her aunt during the trial as the victim was available to testify at trial and she was subject to extensive cross-examination. The victim's statements to her aunt, regardless of whether they were testimonial or non-testimonial, did not violate Crawford or prevent defendant from exercising his right to confrontation. The State conceded the trial court erroneously sentenced defendant for first degree attempted statutory rape to 25 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first degree statutory sodomy conviction was reversed and remanded for the trial court to enter judgment convicting defendant of first degree child molestation and impose sentence accordingly; defendant's sentence for attempted first degree statutory rape was reversed and remanded with instructions that defendant be resentenced as to that count; otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a committee of city residents and its members, sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which dismissed declaratory and injunctive claims against defendants, a city and several local officials, challenging the validity of a city charter provision that permitted the city council to repeal any voter initiated municipal ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The committee undertook to place an initiative for a light rail transportation system on the ballot. The initiative passed, but the city council later repealed the ordinance that was enacted by the initiative. The court held that the ordinance was validly repealed. The court observed that in granting a city the ability to adopt and amend a charter, Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19 reflected a city's broad authority to tailor a form of government that its citizens believed would best serve their interests. While Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 49 set forth the power reserved to the people of Missouri to propose and enact state laws by initiative, the powers reserved to a municipality with respect to enacting municipal ordinances by initiative were defined and limited by the charter. A municipal charter could contain provisions that interfered with the initiative process at the municipal level, and such interference was not contrary to the Missouri Constitution and state laws. Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 49, governing the initiative process on a statewide level, did not provide an unlimited right to the initiative at the municipal level. The court found other claims of error moot in light of its ruling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the parties entered into a stipulation on April 7, 2005. That stipulation provided that the parties were fifty-fifty shareholders of the stock in two companies and fifty-fifty members in the other company. Based on the stipulation, the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 351.467 (2000) were met. The equitable remedy was appropriate. The shareholder was a fifty percent owner. The private sale brought $1,755,000. The shareholder's fifty percent ownership interest was not worth more than the member's fifty percent interest. The trial court concluded as a matter of law that the appointment of a trustee to work with the parties and under the supervision of the appellate court represented a fair and equitable remedy for shareholder and director deadlock under &sect; 351.467 as well as Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 351.494 (2000). The trial court granted judgment in favor of the shareholder on Count I of his counterclaim as there was clear evidence of deadlock.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the patient contended, inter alia, that the probate court erred in overruling his pre-trial motion to declare an amendment to Mo.

The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the issue raised by the patient was determined by a recent controlling decision, which stated that the clear and convincing evidence burden of proof stated in &sect; 632.495 was constitutional. Further, there was no merit in patient's argument that the probate court erred in failing to define the term &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; to the jury and in rejecting his proposed instructions; since there was not a Missouri Approved Instruction (MAI) applicable to this case, the probate court acted correctly in mirroring the language from the SVP Act and following the substantive law. The second instruction in question did not have a substantial potential for prejudicial effect and an average jury would have understood that a finding that the patient was an SVP would have subjected him to the control, care and treatment of the Department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended the library district's use of an improper tax rate ceiling in calculating its year 2000 tax rate and the resulting higher tax rate levies, constituted a violation of the Hancock Amendment and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.073. The trial court found that the library district acted appropriately by setting its tax rates in compliance with the state statutes and state regulations in effect at the time those rates were set. The appellate court ruled that the taxpayers provided clear and convincing testimony that, if the prior year tax rate ceiling in 1999 was $ 0.0833, then the tax rates imposed and collected by the library district from 2000 through 2006 were excessive. The trial court's judgment was not only unsupported by substantial evidence, it was against the weight of the evidence. The taxpayers proffered the 1999 certification letter precisely to prove the prior year tax rate ceiling in 1999. The library district voiced no objection, and the exhibit was admitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Platte County (Missouri), which, after an evidentiary hearing, denied his Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035 motion in which he sought to have his five-year prison term for possession of a controlled substance vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After reading the probation officer's final case summary report, and before the expiration of the three-year probation period, the circuit court entered an order without a hearing that extended defendant's probation for two more years. The circuit court revoked his probation during the extended period and, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.115,  placed him in an institutional treatment program. Defendant had more drug problems after completing the program, and the circuit court again revoked his probation. The court found defendant's Rule 24.035 motion timely, stating that the 180-day period for its filing began when defendant entered the physical custody of the Missouri Department of Corrections, not when the circuit court ordered institutional treatment. Defendant's challenge to the circuit court's authority to extend his probation was cognizable in a Rule 24.035 proceeding. The circuit court had authority under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.036.2 to extend defendant's probation even though there was no pending probation violation and he was not given a hearing. Such an extension did not violate defendant's due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) that found him guilty of attempting to entice a child and attempt to furnish pornographic material to a minor, a violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.151 (Cum. Supp. 2007); defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his request for a mistrial and in refusing to consider a suspended imposition of sentence (SIS) and probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contacted an undercover police officer, who was posing as two different 14-year-old girls, in an internet chat room and later by text message. In the text messages, defendant often discussed sexual acts he would like to engage in with her. He also e-mailed her two pornographic videos featuring him masturbating. At trial, the officer referred to defendant as a &quot;pedophile.&quot; The appellate court found, inter alia, that because the trial court told the jury to disregard the comment, and defense counsel clarified for the jury that defendant had no history of sex offenses, the remark did not prejudice the defendant. In any event, the jury heard hours of admissible testimony regarding defendant's lascivious conversations. Even more damaging to defendant's case were the videos played to the jury of him masturbating. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant defendant's request for a mistrial. The trial court sentenced defendant within the range of punishment prescribed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.151.3 (Cum. Supp. 2007), and, in fact, gave him the minimum permissible sentence. Therefore, it did not err in refusing to consider an SIS and probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, denying its request for declaratory judgment, finding that the company had no standing to challenge the validity of a local ordinance of respondent city because the controversy was not ripe.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was a third-class city, and the company owned residential rental property in the city. The local ordinance required rental property owners to pay a fee and obtain a rental permit. The application for the permit included detailed contact information for the owners of these properties, and it also required that owners show they were in compliance with another city ordinance requiring them to maintain garbage and rubbish collection. Owners were prohibited to allow tenants to occupy the property unless the application for the rental permit was filed and the fee paid each year. The appellate court ruled that the company's action to challenge the enforcement of the ordinance was ripe. The company paid the fee under protest, which showed that the company knew the risk of noncompliance and did not want to have to incur the injury to its business of enforcement before suing. Also, the ordinance was invalid because the city acted outside the scope of its authority under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 94.110 (2000) in enacting it. Third-class cities received authority from Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 94.110 alone, and there was no mention of the rental of residential property in the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded with directions to enter declaratory judgment in favor of the company.</SPAN></P>
