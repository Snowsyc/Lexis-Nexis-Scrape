<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-A circuit court erred in concluding pretrial that the imposition of the death penalty would be a disproportionate penalty where, pursuant to Ky.

Rev. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 418.040, in their constitutionality; [2]-The regulations were not entitled to governmental functions' lesser scrutiny because private enterprises conducted racing, despite pervasive regulation; [3]-The regulations did not violate the dormant commerce clause because their negligible protectionist effect advanced classifying racehorses, and the buyer agreed to this limited bar by seeking a claiming race's benefits instead of buying a horse in another manner, so they did not try to insulate Kentucky's race tracks from out-of-state competition; [4]-They were not impermissibly extraterritorial because they did not regulate racing in other states.</SPAN></P>

R. Evid. 702, in refusing to allow a retired police officer to testify to a variety of missteps during the investigation, as he had no published works or professional credentials beyond his years of experience.</SPAN></P>

P. 9.78; [2]-The motion for findings under Rule 9.78 was treated as a Ky. R. Civ. P. 52.02 motion, thus tolling the appeal period under Ky. R. Civ. P. 73.02; [3]-Suppression of evidence found in a vehicle was not warranted because a search was conducted by an officer in an objectively reasonable reliance on clearly established precedent under New York v. Belton and Henry v. Commonwealth; [4]-Therefore, the exclusionary rule did not apply.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 212.230(1)(c), since the statute could not be construed as a paramount rule from which the ban was derived, as this construction would delegate the Commonwealth's police power too broadly, contrary to Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27 and 28, and the statute was a limited delegation of legislative authority evidenced by the qualification that health boards could adopt, except as otherwise provided by law, administrative regulations not in conflict with the administrative regulations of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services; [2]-The ban was also invalid because the legislature which adopted the statute did not intend or foresee that it would be invoked by an administrative agency to prohibit smoking in public places.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by failing to suppress his statements under U.S. Const. amend. V because his Miranda rights were violated. The supreme court disagreed. Although a detective's question to defendant, &quot;do you know why we are here&quot; constituted a custodial interrogation, an incriminating response was not coerced. The detective arrived at defendant's home with several law enforcement officers and the S.W.A.T. team; under those circumstances, he should have reasonably expected an incriminating response. Defendant was advised of his Miranda rights at the sheriff's office and checked each of them on a written form. Defendant stated he understood them, he voluntarily waived them, and said he would make a statement without counsel present. Neither officer saw any indication that defendant was intoxicated or otherwise unable to speak on an intelligent and voluntary basis. Therefore, defendant's waiver of his Miranda rights at the sheriff's office was made knowingly, rationally, and intelligently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) found appellant guilty of two counts of complicity to commit murder, one count of first-degree robbery, one count of first-degree burglary, and two counts of tampering with physical evidence. Appellant challenged the judgment of conviction and sentence as a matter of right under Ky. Const. &sect; 110(2)(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Testimony at trial and evidence presented during discovery shows that appellant and co-defendant took items, including five knives, from the army surplus store where the first victim worked and was murdered. Both appellant and co-defendant carried a knife stolen from the army surplus store with them to the second victim's apartment. Finally, there was evidence to show the knife used to stab the second victim was from the army surplus store. Thus, joinder of the murder counts was appropriate under Ky. R. Crim. P. 6.18. In addition, appellant was not merely a facilitator of the first murder as he was at the scene of the crime, stole various items from the store where the victim worked, helped co-defendant carry the loot back to the homeless shelter, stored the bags of stolen goods in a storage unit rented under his name, and both he and co-defendant made repeated trips to the unit to retrieve items. Thus, the trial judge was correct in refusing to instruct on criminal facilitation under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 506.080 and instructing the jury on complicity under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 520.020.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to strike a juror. Absent any evidence of actual bias, the sole fact that the juror was an assistant county attorney was not sufficient ground to sustain a motion to strike for cause. At the time of the trial, the juror practiced exclusively in civil cases and was unacquainted with the Commonwealth's prosecuting attorneys. His argument was not preserved for review that Ky. R, Crim. P. 9.40 exceeded the authority granted to the Supreme Court of Kentucky in Ky. Const. &sect; 116 and that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 29A.290(2)(b) was unconstitutional. He had not complied with the notification requirements of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 418.075(1), which were mandatory. He did not argue that a sentence life without the possibility of parole for 25 years was an unconstitutional sentence as applied to juveniles. He unsuccessfully argued that since he could not be sentenced to death, there was no procedure by which to find, present, and instruct the jury on aggravating factors. Ky. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion for directed verdict because the evidence was insufficient under Ky.

Defendant forced the victim to him and began kissing her neck. The victim rejected defendant's advances; but defendant ignored her objections, kept kissing her neck and said, &quot;Don't push me away. You know you want me.&quot; Again, ignoring the victim's protests, defendant unfastened her belt. When the victim re-fastened her belt, he unbuckled it again. The victim testified that she then submitted to defendant's sexual advances out of fear and shock at defendant's actions. The victim told the doctor that she was at her house when a man kissed her neck against her objections and pulled her pants down. She pulled her pants back up and struggled with the man who kept pulling them down. She repeatedly protested and was crying when defendant forced himself upon her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant coal company sought review in the Court of Appeals (Kentucky) of a trial court's judgment affirming the decision of appellee Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (Cabinet) denying the company's application to renew a surface and underground coal mining permit due to a bona fide dispute over its right of entry to land within its permit's boundaries. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, and the company sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found the expiration of a surface lease previously adjudicated by another court created a bona fide dispute over the company's rights to mine coal on the tract. The supreme court held the Cabinet properly denied the renewal application because a bona fide dispute existed over the company's right of entry. The prior judgment created a bona fide dispute because (1) it declared the company's predecessor owned coal and mining rights in and underlying the tract and (2) stated the terms of a 15-year surface lease, which had expired, that could be interpreted to affect the predecessor's right of entry to underground mining, and (3) that judgment bound the company. The Cabinet could not renew the permit because it had no authority to adjudicate the property dispute within the jurisdiction of the court issuing the prior judgment. The Cabinet did not adjudicate the company's property rights because the Cabinet only properly found uncertainty as to the company's right of entry. It was irrelevant that the tract's new surface owner did not intervene because (1) nothing required intervention, and (2) nothing showed the owner's waiver, lease or deed in favor of the company.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 530.064(1) (2007). Despite his argument that the statute did not apply unless the perpetrator induced a minor to commit a crime, the Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed the conviction, and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said he was entitled to a directed verdict because the minor victim was induced to submit to a crime but not to commit one. The supreme court held Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 530.064 (2007) did not require that the minor be induced to commit a crime because the &quot;illegal sexual activity&quot; proscribed by the statute was not limited to sexual activity committed by a minor victim that was illegal for the minor to commit and for which the minor could be sanctioned, as any overlap between the statute and other statutes prohibiting sexual abuse of a minor spoke to the wide diversity of sexual conduct the statutes were meant to regulate, leaving to prosecutorial and grand jury discretion the fitting of any charge to the conduct alleged. Prosecutorial misconduct did not taint defendant's conviction because any such misconduct (1) was not objected to, and (2) was not flagrant or palpable, as the prosecutor's characterization of defendant's minimization of the crime and attempt to shift responsibility to the victim as &quot;offensive&quot; and references to the victim's youth and lost virginity properly responded to defendant's claim of prosecutorial overreaching.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered an Alford guilty plea to first-degree sexual abuse, in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 510.110(1)(d). The Court of Appeals, Kentucky, affirmed, and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Kentucky held that lack of consent is an element under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 510.110(1)(d), and a person under 18 years old cannot consent to sexual contact from a person who is in a position of special trust or authority. Such behavior is sexual abuse in the first degree, and does not require an additional showing of lack of consent. In the current case, the lack-of-consent element was satisfied by the fact that the victim was unable to consent, as she was 17 at the time of the offense and was subjected to sexual contact by a person in a position of authority or special trust within the meaning of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.045(1)(b). Defendant was the victim's uncle and the head of her household at the time of the offense. Defendant lacked standing to raise vagueness and overbreadth challenges. The court nevertheless held that the requirement that the perpetrator be in a &quot;position of authority&quot; and/or &quot;position of special trust&quot; does not render the statute void for vagueness, and that deterring sexual conduct between persons who are 16 to 18 years of age does not rendered it unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee estate successfully sued appellant alleged tortfeasor for wrongful death. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) dismissed the tortfeasor's appeal for failing to name the estate's co-administrators in his notice of appeal. The tortfeasor was granted discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The caption in the tortfeasor's notice of appeal named the decedent's estate, &quot;et al.&quot; as &quot;plaintiffs,&quot; and himself as &quot;defendant,&quot; the notice identified the judgment appealed but did not designate an appellant or appellee, and it was served on the co-administrators' counsel. The supreme court held it was error to dismiss the appeal because omitting the co-administrators was not fatal, as (1) any judicial result bound them, since only they could defend the estate's claims, under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 395.195(19), so they were inexorably linked with it in litigation, and (2) the notice did not bar complete appellate relief, as only they, having notice, could litigate the appeal. It was also error to dismiss the appeal because (1) the co-administrators had notice, constituting substantial compliance with Ky. R. Civ. P. 73.03, and (2) they showed no prejudice, as the notice did not cause them to breach their fiduciary duties, since, having notice, they breached those duties only by ignoring the notice, which did not reflect on its sufficiency. The tortfeasor preserved the sufficiency of his notice because deciding the issue was central to the supreme court's review.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss based upon its claim of sovereign immunity. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court first found that the legislature waived the Commonwealth's right to sovereign immunity in actions brought against the Commonwealth under the Declaratory Judgment Act and had the authority to do so under Ky. Const. &sect; 231. It then found that even if it had not done so, the doctrine of sovereign immunity was not applicable to declaratory judgment actions because to allow a contrary result would permit the Commonwealth to act knowing that the legality of its conduct could never be challenged. It also found that the Commonwealth was a necessary party that could be represented by the relevant Commonwealth agency and that the state attorney general could opt out of the suit because the Commonwealth already was adequately represented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of perjury for lying in a criminal complaint and of theft by deception for obtaining the discharge of a vehicle loan (which she had allegedly co-signed for her boyfriend) by lying to the finance company and saying her name had been forged on the loan documents. The Court of Appeals, Kentucky, affirmed, and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Kentucky held that the evidence was sufficient to avoid a directed verdict on the conviction for theft by deception. The Commonwealth sufficiently proved that defendant obtained property because she obtained the lender's contractual right to collect on the debt. The fact that defendant did not receive tangible property, like the truck itself or money, did not mean she did not commit theft by deception. The finance company's partial reliance on its own internal investigation did not negate the element of reliance because defendant's identity-theft affidavit was also part of the reason for the discharge. The court reversed the convictions, however, because defendant was entitled to ask on cross-examination about the conduct underlying the boyfriend's prior misdemeanor convictions for giving a false name to a peace officer. Ky. R. Evid. 608 and 609 allowed some inquiry as to the conduct underlying a criminal conviction, so long as the conduct was probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness. The error was not harmless because the evidence went to the core of the defense and would have impeached the character and credibility of the Commonwealth's star witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the  trash pulls were illegal under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The supreme court agreed. Defendant used the area where the trash cans were located for home storage, staging yard work, and parking his car. The activities defendant used the area for were quintessential &quot;activities of domestic life.&quot; There was no public right of access through curtilage that did not involve interaction with, or the benefit or convenience of, the homeowner. Instead, police must attempt to contact the resident of the home upon entering the curtilage to avoid violating the Fourth Amendment. The officer never tried to contact defendant or other residents of the house; indeed, the officer's chosen approach to investigating--a covert trash pull--depended entirely on not encountering the residents. The officer never intended to go to the front door and engage in such business with defendant. Instead, he went directly to the trash cans under cover of darkness to search them. His goal was not engaging the homeowner, but to approach the house under cover and to avoid detection, thereby avoiding interacting with defendant at all.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court erred by not insuring on the record that defendant had been apprised of his right to a twelve-person jury and personally agreed to waive it because defense counsel stipulated to proceeding with less than twelve jurors and defendant only seemingly acquiesced. A remand was necessary for the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine if defendant knowingly and voluntarily consented to that decision. If, after an evidentiary hearing, the trial court found that defendant validly waived his right to a twelve-person jury, his conviction was to be reinstated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellate court held that there was no conflict of interest adversely affecting defendant's lawyer's performance; defendant's bare assertion that a conflict existed because his lawyers represented other defendants in alleged violation of Ky.

Further, defendant was not deprived of his speedy trial rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Ky. Const. &sect; 11 because, although the 20-month delay was presumptively prejudicial, defendant was largely responsible, failed to vigorously assert his right to a speedy trial, and suffered little prejudice. The trial court did not violate Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 500.110 because trial began within 180 days of when defendant submitted written notice asserting his right to a speedy trial. Finally, the prejudice suffered by defendant under U.S. Const. amend. VI from his witnesses wearing prison garb and shackles was minimal because the crime scene was a prison and the jury would have known during the course of the witnesses' testimony that they were incarcerated at the time of the event whether or not they were wearing shackles or prison garb.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Fayette Circuit Court, (Kentucky) of two counts of intentional murder and was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by permitting an officer to testify, from his experience investigating self-defense related homicides, how persons who legitimately exercised the right of self-protection typically behaved. The supreme court agreed. The officer opined that defendant did not act like those who had lawfully protected themselves but, had instead acted like those who were fabricating a self-protection defense. The testimony was incompetent under Ky. R. Evid. 406 because it permitted the police detective to authoritatively suggest how innocent persons behaved after they lawfully engaged in an act of self-defense, and to then, with some measure of certainty, exclude defendant from that class of persons based upon his conduct following the shooting. The opinion of an experienced and respected officer that defendant's conduct did not match the stereo-typical conduct of an innocent person acting in self-defense authoritatively portrayed defendant's defense as a fabrication. That testimony was clearly devastating to defendant's claim of self-defense, and accordingly, reversal was required.</SPAN></P>

After the social worker investigated, the social worker concluded that the allegation was &quot;substantiated.&quot; The adult citizen was informed of that result.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Campbell Circuit Court (Kentucky) of first-degree fleeing or evading police, fourth-degree assault, possession of marijuana, and being a first-degree persistent felony offender (PFO). Defendant received a sentence of twenty years' imprisonment and was fined $600. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court issued erroneous jury instructions on the fleeing or evading police charge. The supreme court agreed. No mention was made of the statutory term, &quot;unmarried couple&quot; in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 403.720. The instructions were at odds with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 520.095, which required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was &quot;fleeing immediately after committing an act of domestic violence as defined in &sect; 403.720.&quot; Absent a finding that the participants in an alleged domestic altercation were an unmarried couple, mere roommates could be charged with having domestically abused one another. The jury was not instructed to find that defendant and the complainant were members of an unmarried couple. Thus, the tendered instructions erroneously failed to require the correct findings. Because the jury was not properly instructed as to the domestic violence element (in that the trial court failed to include a definition of an &quot;unmarried couple&quot;) the trial court's error was prejudicial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions and sentences for first-degree fleeing or evading and first-degree PFO were reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings. The portions of defendant's sentences for fourth-degree assault and possession of marijuana imposing fines were vacated. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant drivers sought review of an opinion from the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which affirmed their convictions and fines for violating Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 189.820 by not displaying a slow-moving vehicle emblem on their horse-and-buggy vehicles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The drivers asserted that the brightly colored emblem conflicted with their religious beliefs, which required plainness, and that they should be allowed to use gray reflective tape instead. The court stated that the free-exercise-of-religion protections in Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 1, 5 provided no more protection than the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. Accordingly, federal case law was relevant to determining the appropriate standard of review under Kentucky law. The court held that governmental enactments that provided for the public health, safety, and welfare, and that were statutes of general applicability only incidentally affecting the practice of religion, were subject to rational basis review under Kentucky law. Enactments that directly prohibited or restrained a religious practice were subject to a strict scrutiny standard of review. Because &sect; 189.820 applied to all slow-moving vehicles on the public highways, did not prohibit any religious practice, and was aimed at public general safety, the rational basis standard of review applied. There was ample rational basis for a statute regulating slow-moving vehicles for safety reasons; thus, &sect; 189.820 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Campbell Circuit Court (Kentucky) of first-degree fleeing or evading police, under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 520.095, fourth-degree assault, possession of marijuana, and being a first-degree persistent felony offender (PFO 1), and he was sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined $600.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on fleeing and evading. The supreme court agreed because (1) Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 520.095 required a finding that he was fleeing immediately after committing an act of domestic violence as defined in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 403.720, requiring findings that he committed an act of violence enumerated in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 403.720, and that he and the victim were members of an &quot;unmarried couple,&quot; but, (2) under the instruction given, the jury had to find him guilty if it decided he and the victim had &quot;shared living quarters,&quot; without mentioning the statutory definition of an &quot;unmarried couple&quot; in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 403.720(4), so the instructions were too broad. The error was not harmless because (1) erroneous instructions were presumed prejudicial, and (2) that presumption was not rebutted when the jury was improperly instructed on the elements of the crime. It was error to impose criminal fines because (1) the trial court previously found defendant to be indigent, under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31.100(3), and (2)&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 534.040(4) barred the imposition of fines on a person found to be indigent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty but mentally ill (GBMI) of murder and guilty of first-degree assault (as a lesser included offense of attempted murder). The Graves Circuit Court, Kentucky, adopted recommendations of life in prison for the murder conviction and 20 years in prison for the assault conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Kentucky held that the dismissal of a prior indictment based on incompetence to stand trial, without a designation as with or without prejudice, was effectively without prejudice; therefore, it did not act as an adjudication on the merits, and double jeopardy and res judicata issues were inapposite. In reaching that conclusion, the court held that a trial court's dismissal of an indictment based on a finding that the defendant is incompetent to stand trial is not a dismissal with prejudice unless it is designated as such with the consent of the Commonwealth's attorney. Therefore, applying Ky. R. Civ. P. 41.02(3) to criminal cases violates separation of powers principles. Further, prosecution of a criminal defendant originally found incompetent to stand trial is permissible on a subsequent finding of competency, so long as the later prosecution does not violate Constitutional rights. The court also held that the GBMI instruction was proper; there was sufficient evidence of competence; the evidence did not support an instruction on extreme emotional disturbance; defendant's mental illness did not render his statements involuntary; and joinder was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and father had a child together. The father committed suicide. A few months later, the paternal grandmother filed a petition under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 405.021(1) to establish grandparent visitation with the child. The mother opposed the petition and filed a motion to dismiss, which the trial court denied. The trial court found that it was in the child's best interest to grant visitation with the grandmother. The court of appeals upheld the decision. On review, the court found that in granting the grandmother visitation under &sect; 405.021(1), the trial court failed to give the mother's decision to deny visitation the special weight that was due a fit parent. The grandmother failed to rebut by clear and convincing evidence the presumption that the mother was acting in the child's best interest. A new evidentiary hearing was appropriate because the trial court did not apply the appropriate standard in determining whether visitation with the grandmother was in the child's best interest, the trial court's findings of fact were troubling, and two years had passed since the original hearing. The trial court properly denied the mother's motion to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents sued defendants, a county board of education and its superintendent, claiming their children were denied the statutory right afforded them by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159.070 to attend the public school nearest their home. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs appealed; the Court of Appeals of Kentucky reversed. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 159.070, parents were &quot;permitted to enroll their children in the public school nearest their home.&quot; Plaintiffs argued that this meant their children were entitled to attend that neighborhood school, while defendants argued that &quot;enroll&quot; was not synonymous with &quot;attend.&quot; The intermediate appellate court agreed with plaintiffs' construction of &sect; 159.070, ordered defendants to develop a new student assignment plan, and granted a local circuit judge final authority on the assignment of public school students. The high court noted that the terms &quot;enroll&quot; and &quot;attend&quot; were not used interchangeably in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. XIII, ch. 159, and held that &quot;enroll,&quot; as used &sect; 159.070, did not carry the weight ascribed to it by plaintiffs. Based on the language of &sect; 159.070, which was ambiguous, its legislative history, and the other provisions of ch. 159, the high court held that &sect; 159.070 did not grant schoolchildren a right to attend the school nearest their home. The assignment of pupils to schools within a school district was a matter the legislature committed to the sound discretion of the local school board. Therefore, the trial court properly dismissed plaintiffs' complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several weeks after defendant was convicted of first-degree sodomy, he moved for a new trial based upon an unsworn, unauthenticated note purportedly written by a member of the jury panel that convicted him. The note stated that the jury had been influenced by defendant's criminal record, which was in the jury room, and that the writer had been pressured into voting to convict. The trial court denied the motion for a new trial. The court of appeals reversed and remanded the case for a hearing to ascertain the validity of the claim. On review, the court held that an unsworn letter by a lone juror, lacking authentication and verification, was insufficient under Ky. R. Crim. P. 10.04 to trigger the process for further inquiry regarding whether the jury verdict was tainted by the consideration of extrinsic information. An inquiry into the validity of the jury verdict would necessitate bringing in the entire jury for examination, along with the bailiff. Such a process would have been triggered by an unauthenticated and unsworn document written, apparently, by a person who was unwilling to replicate her allegations under oath and who would not speak to trial counsel about the allegations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge became the focus of a lengthy investigation by the Commission, culminating in formal charges consisting of 20 allegations of misconduct in office. The commission found official misconduct on 9 of the charges and ordered that he be removed from office. The judge asked the supreme court to overturn the findings, but the supreme court affirmed as to 8 counts of official misconduct and the Commission's decision to remove the judge from office. The supreme court stated, in part, that he violated Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 4.300 by personally participating in fund-raising. Additionally, he also violated Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 4.020 and 4.300 when he voluntarily dismissed a complain against Kentucky Utilities and then urged its counsel to agree to donate money for playground equipment at the elementary school that the judge's children attended. The judge further engaged in ex parte communications and changed a defendant's bond conditions without a hearing or giving notice to that defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission (Commission) brought 20 allegations of misconduct in office against movant judge. Following an adversarial hearing on these charges, the Commission found official misconduct on nine charges and ordered the judge removed from office, under Ky. Const. &sect; 121. The judge sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge said Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 4.300, Canons 1 and 2A, were vague. The supreme court disagreed because he knew his duties and possible discipline. His Sixth Amendment rights were not violated because it did not apply. The Commission could be investigator and adjudicator because it was an administrative body. Its members did not have to recuse because this was not required by (1) the chair's association with an investigator, (2) representation by counsel who presented evidence, (3) the chair's comments, and (4) receipt of Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 4.170 pre-hearing material. His Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 4.170 rights were observed because (1) he had complainants' identities, and (2) he was not denied exculpatory material. The Commission's findings did not clearly err as to eight counts because he (1) used his office for personal objectives, (2) made misrepresentations in an order, (3) had an official investigated before an election in which his cousin ran, (4) had ex parte communications, (5) heard cases when he was a complainant, (6) raised funds, and (7) ignored required procedures in removing counsel. Changing a defendant's release terms was not misconduct because nothing showed no hearing was held.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) convicted defendant of murder, tampering with physical evidence, and violating a protective order. Though the Commonwealth sought the death penalty, defendant was instead sentenced to life in prison without benefit of probation or parole. Defendant appealed to the supreme court as a matter of right under Ky. Const. &sect; 110(2)(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The harmless error rule did not allow reversal for the unredacted portions of defendant's interviews with police because none of the statements raised by defendant could have had a substantial effect on the jury. Also, there was little to no risk that the jury would have considered the evidence, inferred that another crime occurred, and convicted defendant. While the statements should have been redacted from both the recording and the transcript, their inclusion amounted to harmless error. In addition, requiring the Commonwealth to prove the existence of extreme emotional disturbance (EED) for a first-degree manslaughter conviction or the absence of EED for a murder conviction was erroneous, but any error was prejudicial only to the Commonwealth, not defendant. Thus, the error was harmless. Additionally, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 189A.104's bar on the admission of portable breathalyzer test (PBT) results in driving under the influence (DUI) cases did not bar defendant seeking to admit that result as part of a defense in a non-DUI prosecution. However, the exclusion of the PBT evidence was harmless error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment dismissing his petition for a declaratory judgment in which he sought to challenge the implementation of his death sentences upon the grounds that he is mentally retarded. The supreme court affirmed however, stating that it was the law of the case that he had procedurally defaulted on his mental retardation claim and that he had failed to demonstrate adequate cause for his default. It was further, predominantly (except for one de minimis omission), the law of the case that defendant could not make a prima facie showing that he was able to meet the statutory definition for mental retardation because IQ scores taken around the time of trial reflected that he had an IQ in the 86-87 range, which effectively foreclosed any reasonable possibility that he could be found mentally retarded following an evidentiary hearing on the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kenton Circuit Court, Kentucky, denied defendant's motions to prohibit execution of the death sentence because of mental retardation (mental retardation motion) and to compel deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing of hairs and semen found in the victim's automobile and used by the prosecution in his 1988 trial (DNA motion). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Kentucky held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's mental retardation motion under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.130-140 without an evidentiary hearing. Defendant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his mental retardation motion because he produced some evidence that he was mentally retarded. He submitted school records indicating that at age 14, he had an IQ of 62, was reading at a third-grade level, and was performing work at a first- and second-grade level. The fact that there were also positive indications of a defendant's adaptive behavior went to the weight and credibility of the evidence. The court also held that (1) Kentucky's procedures for establishing whether capital offenders were mentally retarded did not violate defendant's due process rights; (2) the trial court properly denied a motion for DNA testing of hairs; (3) defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine if the hairs were destroyed after a preservation order; (4) the trial court erred by failing to rule on defendant's request for DNA testing of semen; and (5) defendant was not entitled to DNA testing under the federal or state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling denying defendant's motion for DNA testing of hair; vacated the trial court's order to the extent that it failed to rule on whether defendant was entitled to DNA testing of semen and remanded that issue for a ruling; and vacated the trial court's ruling on the mental retardation motion and remanded that issue for an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a checkpoint for the purpose of general crime control or detection of ordinary criminal wrongdoing included violations of a city ordinance. The court further held that because the checkpoint's only purpose was to enforce a revenue-raising tax upon vehicles in the city and the checkpoint to enforce the sticker ordinance comported with none of the purposes that the United States Supreme Court had found to be important enough to override the individual liberty interests secured by the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Kentucky Legislative Research Commission, sought review of a judgment from the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky), which, in a suit brought by appellee voters, found redistricting plans for the Kentucky House of Representatives and the Kentucky Senate to be unconstitutional and issued a temporary injunction prohibiting the implementation of the legislative districts created by the plans.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of the redistricting plans contained one district with a population deviation greater than 5 percent from the ideal district as determined by reference to census data. Alternative plans were proposed in both chambers that divided fewer counties and that had a population variance within plus-or-minus 5 percent of the ideal districts. The court held that the redistricting plans violated Ky. Const. &sect; 33 by failing to divide the fewest number of counties possible and by failing to achieve sufficient population equality. Although it was not possible to avoid all splitting of counties without violating equal protection principles, county integrity had to be balanced with population equality to accommodate both. Population equality was not presumed where population deviations exceeded 5 percent. The existence of alternative conforming plans did not establish unconstitutionality in itself but showed that greater population inequality was not a necessary consequence of pursuing county integrity, and no other rational state policy had been advanced. The finding of unconstitutionality made the plans null and void; thus, even if the plans were more efficient, they could not be used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kentucky Court of Appeals concluded that appellee organization was a purely charitable organization and thus ad valorem exempt from taxation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that appellee's real property was not tax exempt under Ky. Const. &sect; 170. The evidence did not establish that appellee was a purely public charity or that its property was employed for a purely charitable purpose. Appellee's activities were inconsistent with a &quot;purely public charity&quot; as its activities were not wholly altruistic in the end to be attained. Appellee's actual activities involved developing and marketing commercial property, activities which primarily served and benefited appellee's buyers or customers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was 19-years-old, was involved with others in a residential burglary. Because defendant's role appeared to be minor, he was offered a plea deal that diverted his sentence. He accepted the offer, which was approved subject to the condition that within six months, he pay statutory court costs of $ 130.00 to the trial court clerk. However, he objected based on his claim that even modest court costs would be a hardship. He also claimed that the court was required under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31.110 to waive costs. The trial court rejected those arguments. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that Ky. Rev. Stat Ann. &sect; 31.110 providing that &quot;needy persons&quot; facing serious criminal charges were entitled to representation by an attorney at public expenses did not give defendant the blanket immunity from costs that he suggested. It determined that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23A.205 requiring convicted people to pay court costs allowed court costs to be waived for &quot;poor persons,&quot; as defined in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 453.190(2), but that defendant could reasonably be expected to work and pay the modest amount imposed because he had been released from custody.</SPAN></P>

The Cabinet's actions did not deprive the contractor of a protected property interest. The contractor did not allege sufficient injury to meet the &quot;plus&quot; element of the stigma plus test. The Cabinet impaired the contractor's ability to conduct business with the prime contractors by impugning the contractor's reputation. It took no other action to alter the contractor's legal status or inhibit it from conducting future business with the prime contractors. There were sufficient safeguards to prevent the Cabinet from abusing any legislative or judicial authority granted to it under the prevailing wage law. The Cabinet could not exercise unfettered discretion, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 337.505. The Cabinet did not engage in agency adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Kentucky) that convicted him of five counts of first-degree sodomy involving a 14-year-old boy, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress a condom evidence because a condom found on his property was within the curtilage of his home and was discovered without a warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim disclosed that he had been sodomized repeatedly by defendant, his aunt's boyfriend. When he told the police that he could show them the location in the woods where defendant assaulted him, the police took the boy to the location and discovered a condom that defendant had discarded. Both defendant's and the boy's DNA were detected on the condom. Defendant was charged with sodomy, and the trial court ruled that the condom was admissible because it was found in an outdoor area that was not part of the curtilage of defendant's home. On review, the court held that the area was not part of the curtilage of defendant's home and was not protected from warrantless search and seizure because the area was approximately 400 feet from the house, the area was not enclosed by a fence, and defendant used that portion of property for hunting and four-wheeling, which were not intimate activities of the home that would show that the area was part of the curtilage. Therefore, the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, or Ky. Const. &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Muhlenberg Circuit Court (Kentucky) convicting him of murder and sentencing him to life in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court did not err by excluding evidence concerning the nature of an alleged accomplice's prior crime because, to the extent defendant sought to impeach her, the evidence was inadmissible under Ky. R. Evid. 609(a), as the accomplice did not deny her conviction and the crime, a threat against the purported informant in that case, said nothing about her honesty or any bias she may have had against defendant. The evidence was not admissible under Ky. R. Evid. 404(b) because the accomplice's threat had virtually no similarity to the victim's murder, gave rise to no inference that the two acts were committed by the same person, and there were three years between the incidents. Nor did the exclusion deprive defendant of his right to put on a complete defense because the accomplice's threat was only marginally relevant, if that, to her state of mind three years later with respect to the victim and did not leave defendant's defense in a shambles. The trial court did not err by refusing to give a missing evidence instruction because the detective's destruction of his notes once they had been incorporated in his report appeared to have been routine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a county resident and a nonprofit association, filed an action challenging a decision of the fiscal court to discontinue maintenance on a county road under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 178.070, and against appellant property owner, who erected a locked gate blocking the road. The circuit court enjoined the property owner from blocking the road with a gate, and the Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county resident did not live or own property along the road. The nonprofit consisted of various residents, including one member who owed property exclusively accessed by the road. They wanted the road to remain open and unobstructed because it provided them with a shortcut to other destinations and provided access to several sites on the road that were important to their families' history. While the individual resident failed to who any specific injury sufficient to provide standing, with the member who owned property on the road, the nonprofit had associational standing to assert the claim. Summary judgment holding that the fiscal court properly discontinued maintenance of the road pursuant to &sect; 178.070 was not appealed and, therefore, became a final adjudication on that point. Thus, the road was discontinued as a county-maintained way under &sect; 178.070. Further, no petition satisfying the requirements of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 178.116(4) was ever filed and, thus, the road had to remain an open, public road. Finally, there was no unconstitutional taking of property and there was no constitutional infirmity to the applications of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 178.070 and -.116.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee coal workers sought compensation benefits for coal workers' pneumoconiosis (black lung). The Workers' Compensation Board affirmed decisions to dismiss both cases because the consensus readings of their X-rays found them negative for black lung. On review, however, the Court of Appeals (Kentucky) held that the consensus procedure required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316 was unconstitutional. Appellant employers sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For coal workers' pneumoconiosis, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(3) required a different procedure to establish its existence than it required for all other types of pneumoconiosis. In addition, &sect; 342.316(13) required clear and convincing evidence to rebut a panel consensus for coal workers' pneumoconiosis claims, while Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.315(2), addressing other occupational pneumoconiosis and diseases, required only a reasonable basis to rebut a university evaluator's clinical findings and opinions. There was no rational basis or substantial and justifiable reason for the disparate treatment of coal workers in this instance. Pneumoconiosis caused by exposure to coal dust was the same disease as pneumoconiosis caused by exposure to dust particles in other industries, yet coal workers faced different, higher standard-of-proof requirements than those other workers. Consequently, the consensus procedure required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316 for proving the existence of coal workers' pneumoconiosis, and the clear and convincing standard the statute required to rebut such a consensus, violated the equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 1-3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant candidate, a deputy clerk, was discharged from her position shortly after announcing her candidacy for the office of county clerk. Following her defeat in the primary election, the candidate brought an action against appellees, the incumbent county clerk and the county, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The circuit court dismissed the complaint by summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed. The candidate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, the county clerk and the county were not immune from the &sect; 1983 claim because subdivisions of the State were &quot;persons&quot; for the purposes of &sect; 1983 and were not entitled to be shielded from liability by State-created immunities. On the merits of the claim, the candidate alleged that she had been discharged from her position as deputy clerk in violation of her rights under U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The county clerk maintained that she was not aware of the candidate's intention to run against her and that the discharge was for work-related reasons. However, the resolution of that factual point was not germane to the appeal because, upon review of the dismissal by summary judgment, the facts were viewed from the candidate's perspective. Settled law held that there was no U.S. Const. amend. I right to candidacy, and there was no reason to deviate from settled law on the point. The First Amendment afforded no constitutional protection to candidacy for political office per se. Accordingly, the candidate failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Finally, the candidate's cursory U.S. Const. amend. XIV due process argument did not comply with Ky. R. Civ. P. 76.12(4)(c)(v).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice/wrongful death action, defendant medical center challenged an opinion of the Kentucky Court of Appeals that affirmed a judgment in favor of plaintiffs, arguing that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the adverse inference that could be made on the basis of missing evidence and in instructing the jury on punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During surgery, the patient suffered an unexpected, substantial blood loss. Because of a delay in obtaining blood for transfusion, the patient sustained an anoxic brain injury, and she succumbed after being removed from a life support system. Following the surgery, a nurse prepared an incident report, which the medical center was unable to produce during discovery in the ensuing lawsuit. At trial, the trial court instructed the jury that it could infer that the missing incident report would have been adverse to the medical center. On review, the court held that, because the incident report was within the exclusive control of the medical center and its loss was inexplicable, the jury was properly instructed that it could find that the evidence was intentionally and in bad faith destroyed or concealed and that, if available, its contents would be adverse to the medical center. However, the trial court erred in instructing the jury on punitive damages because such an instruction was only proper if the evidence supported a finding that the medical center should have anticipated the inordinate delay in obtaining blood for transfusion or that it authorized or ratified the delay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The opinion of the court of appeals was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case was remanded to the trial court for entry of a new judgment that excluded the punitive damages award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized in the search of his vehicle because: (1) the traffic stop was constitutional, as the officer stopped defendant for not wearing a seatbelt and reckless driving; (2) the police saw a laptop bag and lights in plain view inside the vehicle, which they had probable cause to believe were recently stolen; and (3) defendant's vehicle was readily mobile even though defendant was under arrest at the time the officers conducted the search. The trial court did not err by denying a directed verdict for manufacturing methamphetamine under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 218A.1432(1)(b) because a detective testified that: (1) he found four plastic bottles at the scene, three that were inactive methamphetamine labs and on that was an HCL generator used to cook methamphetamine; (2) three of the bottles tested positive for ammonia; (3) he also found rock salt, plastic tubing, a measuring cup, a spoon, a funnel, and lighter fluid in the vehicle, all of which were commonly used in cooking methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which vacated the trial court's judgment appraising appellee dissenter's shares pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 271B.13-300 following a cash-out merger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court adopted a commissioner's report that discounted the capitalized earnings value for lack of marketability, considered the net asset value, and averaged the two values. The court found no error in the trial court's Ky. R. Civ. P. 54.02 ruling severing the appraisal from other claims against the dissenter because the valuation judgment finally determined a statutory claim that was distinct and severable. An offhand remark by the trial judge indicating that he expected to be accused of bias did not reasonably call his impartiality into question under Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 4.300 and thus did not require recusal. The court agreed with the court of appeals that marketability discounts were inappropriate at the shareholder level in determining fair value as defined in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 271B.13-010(3) and that the Delaware block method of appraisal was not required. The court overruled Ford v. Courier-Journal Job Printing Co., 639 S.W.2d 553 (Ky. App. 1982) to the extent inconsistent. Net asset valuation methods, which involved estimating the market value of company assets, were not precluded by the fair value standard. Entity-level discounts were permissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the court of appeals' conclusion that the appraisal order had to be vacated, reversed the court of appeals' rejection of the net asset approach, and remanded to the trial court for reappraisal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Casey Circuit Court (Kentucky) of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 527.040. Defendant was also found to be a first-degree persistent felony offender and was sentenced to a maximum term of twenty years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the twenty-year sentence imposed when he was found to be a persistent felony offender (PFO) was unconstitutionally excessive in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 17 and U.S. Const. amend. VIII, given the remoteness of two of his prior offenses, the relatively minor nature of all of his offenses, and the Commonwealth's own recognition, as evidenced by its plea offer, that a shorter sentence was appropriate. The supreme court disagreed. The twenty-year recidivist sentence with the possibility of parole in no more than four years, while harsh, was simply not an extreme sentence; it did not approach the upper limits of Kentucky's sentencing structure and could not be deemed &quot;grossly disproportionate&quot; as the Supreme Court has employed that term. As defendant's sentence was neither extreme within Kentucky's sentencing scheme nor grossly disproportionate for a third felony, however &quot;soft&quot; those felonies may have been, he was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed the victims, a husband and wife and their son, at the behest and with the assistance of their daughter during a robbery and burglary. Defendant initially entered into a plea agreement with the State but subsequently withdrew his plea and proceeded to trial. On review, the court held that, while Ky. R. Evid. 410 precluded the Commonwealth from introducing into evidence statements made by defendant during plea negotiations, defendant's two statements were admissible because they were made after the formal plea agreement was fully negotiated and signed. Further, the trial court did not err under Ky. R. Evid. 404(b) in allowing a witness to testify that defendant had a human silhouette target hanging outside his cubicle at work with approximately 26 bullet holes in an upper body spray pattern because the evidence was relevant to establish defendant's ability, knowledge, and competency with firearms.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Bullitt Circuit Court (Kentucky) that convicted him of multiple sex crimes against his daughter that occurred over the course of 15 years and began when she was merely six years old, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's sodomy convictions. Count 4 charged defendant with engaging in oral sex with his daughter when she was 14 years old, and Count 5 charged him with doing so when the girl was 15 years old. The victim testified that, when she was 14, oral sex occurred &quot;all the time&quot; and that, when she was 15, sexual activity--both vaginal and oral--occurred daily. As such, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of those crimes. Further, such testimony was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for raping his daughter when she was 15. However the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction for raping the girl when she was 14 because there was no testimony from the victim that defendant had begun engaging her in sexual intercourse by that point. Further, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's six incest convictions because the victim testified that, from the time she turned 15 until she left home at age 22, sexual intercourse occurred daily.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of one count of first-degree rape was reversed for insufficient evidence, but defendant's remaining convictions of four counts of sodomy, one count of first-degree sexual abuse, three counts of third-degree rape, and six counts of incest were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder and robbery after robbing and shooting the proprietor of convenience store and a customer in the backs of their heads. On review, the court held that an objection to one acting as a special judge could not be made for the first time on appeal. Because appellant made no argument that the special judge failed to provide him with fair and impartial review, appellant's objection to the special judge was overruled. Further, the court rejected appellant's challenge to the effective representation of his postconviction counsel because ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims were limited to counsel's performance on direct appeal; there was no counterpart for counsel's performance on Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owners challenged a decision from the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which reversed a trial court's decision that two ordinances were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose after a subdivision of property was sought by the owners. The trial court found that two ordinances were unconstitutional, but the court of appeals reversed. This appeal followed. In partially affirming, the supreme court determined that the agricultural supremacy clause took agricultural uses outside of the jurisdiction of zoning ordinances and agricultural divisions outside of the jurisdiction of subdivision regulations. The issue here was whether the proposed conveyances had to have planning commission approval or whether they were exempt under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 100.111(22), 100.111(2), and 100.203(4). Three elements had to exist for an exemption. The conveyances here did not meet the requirement that the use was restricted to agricultural uses. Moreover, the conveyances did not meet the third requirement, which was that all parcels had to have frontage on an existing street.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the court of appeals' decision holding two county ordinances valid was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted review of consolidated appeals from decisions of the Kentucky Court of Appeals. One matter was a wrongful death tort action filed in civil court by appellant widower against appellee school district after his wife, a school teacher, died on school grounds. The second case was a claim filed at the Kentucky Board of Claims, based on the same facts, in which appellant was a board of education and the widower was appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Board of Claims action, the court of appeals held that the action was time-barred. The court disagreed with that conclusion, finding that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 403.270 gave the widower 90 days following the conclusion of the action in the circuit court to file his Board of Claims action. It determined, however, that the Board of Claims action was premature and a nullity, since the same cause of action was then properly pending before the circuit court. In the tort action, the court of appeals dismissed the widower's appeal of the summary judgment against him, for reasons of governmental immunity, due to his failure to name an indispensable party in his notice of appeal. Joinder rules were not dispositive, so the court looked at Ky. R. Civ. P. 73.03, requiring that an appellant name all appellees. The court rejected the widower's argument that any relief against the school district would also cover the board of education and thus the board of education was not indispensable to the appeal. The board of education was an indispensable party on appeal and the widower's notice of appeal was therefore jurisdictionally defective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the appeal of the Board of Claims action, the court reversed the court of appeals on its ultimate conclusion and ordered that the widower be allowed to refile his action in the future. In the direct appeal of the underlying tort action, the court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

This included statements contained in the ethics complaint. In a matter of first impression, the supreme court concluded that the judicial statements privilege encompassed the act of filing the complaint, in addition to the statements contained therein. Any communication or statement made to the Kentucky Bar Association during the course of a disciplinary hearing or investigation, including the contents of the bar complaint initiating such proceedings, were absolutely privileged. This privilege extended to any claim relating to the act of filing the bar complaint, such as abuse of process, wrongful use of civil proceedings, or malicious prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the judgment rendered against him was void because a retired senior judge presided over his trial. the trial judge's service on the case as a special judge was by assignment of the chief justice, a process which defendant argued violated his right under the Kentucky Constitution to be tried by a duly-elected or a gubernatorially-appointed circuit court judge. After indictment, the case was assigned to the trial judge, who was then duly-elected judge. He later retired from his seat on the bench and entered into the senior judge program. Because of impending changes in the senior judge program, some 22 other judges across Kentucky also retired. With additional vacancies created by other causes, a total of 27 judgeships were vacant, which was an exceptionally high number. The court upheld the decision. At the time of his assignment as a special judge, the trial judge was a retired judge qualified for service in the vacant judgeship. The Kentucky Constitution gave the chief justice the authority to have made the assignment as he deemed necessary. As such, the trial judge was constitutionally empowered to preside over the case under Ky. Const. &sect; 110(5)(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurer sued defendant mining company (company) alleging that the company had underpaid premiums under two workers' compensation policies. The company counterclaimed, alleging that it had overpaid the premiums and was entitled to a refund. The circuit court granted the company's motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) reversed. The supreme court granted discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued, inter alia, that in light of the notices of 23 employees rejecting workers' compensation coverage and lowering premiums, the burden shifted to the insurer to produce affirmative evidence demonstrating that the rejections were not made voluntarily, and that the insurer failed to do so. The supreme court agreed. The court of appeals failed to credit the presumptive validity of the rejection notices. It was undisputed that 23 employees executed proper forms to reject workers' compensation coverage, and that the forms were properly filed and were presumptively valid. Through the signed rejection forms, the company met its initial burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact existed on the issue of whether the employees had voluntarily rejected workers' compensation coverage. It was then incumbent upon the insurer to come forward with some evidence casting doubt on the validity of the notices. The insurer alleged, inter alia, that the employees were designated as officers of the company solely to qualify different coverage to reduce its workers' compensation premiums. Such allegations did not amount to affirmative evidence raising a genuine issue of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by refusing to give jury instructions on second-degree burglary under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 511.030(1) and second-degree robbery under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 515.030(1) because they were not warranted by the evidence, particularly the overwhelming and uncontradicted evidence that the intruder caused the victim physical injury. The victim testified that the intruder hit him with a gun and that he suffered a sprained ankle fleeing from the intruder, a man who helped the victim testified that he was bleeding from his face and feet, and a detective testified that the victim appeared to be in shock and was obviously beaten. The court rejected defendant's contention that an evidentiary hearing was required on his motion to suppress DNA evidence, arguing that his DNA profile was illegally entered into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) database, because a warrant to obtain a buccal swab from defendant was properly issued and was not based on any prior CODIS entries or matches.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insured challenged a decision from the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which reversed the summary judgment granted to the insured by the trial court in a workers' compensation insurance premium dispute involving appellee insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured contended that it overpaid premiums because 23 of its employees executed a form rejecting workers' compensation coverage under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.395. The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the insured. Issues of black lung coverage and prejudgment interest were addressed. The appellate court reversed the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment. In reversing the court of appeals, the supreme court gave substantial weight to the signed rejection forms. By introducing the signed notices, the insured's motion for summary judgment was properly supported; it was then incumbent upon the insurer to come forward with evidence casting doubt on the validity of the rejection notices. The insurer produced nothing to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact concerning the voluntariness of the rejection notices. Because the prejudgment interest and black lung issues were not the subject of a cross-motion for discretionary review and were not independent grounds for affirming the court of appeals, the issues were remanded to the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeals was reversed, and the judgment of the trial court was reinstated to the extent that it found the workers' compensation rejections voluntary and that the insured overpaid its premiums as a result. The case was remanded to the court of appeals for the consideration of other issues.</SPAN></P>

Defamatory speech could be enjoined only after the trial court's final determination by a preponderance of the evidence that the speech at issue was, in fact, false, and only then upon the condition that the injunction was narrowly tailored to limit the prohibited speech to that which had been judicially determined to be false. Application of the modern rule that defamatory speech could be enjoined only following a final determination that the speech was false compelled the result that collection company be granted the relief requested in his Ky.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed trial court orders invalidating appellant utility's surcharge or rider aimed at recovering costs associated with the utility's program to accelerate improvement of its gas distribution mains as it existed before the enactment of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 278.509  in 2005, but reversed trial court orders invalidating the rider after the enactment of &sect; 278.509. The court granted discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant case involved five consolidated appeals by appellee Commonwealth from appellant Kentucky Public Service Commission's (PSC) orders over a five-year period approving and implementing a portion of the utility's rate schedule known as the accelerated main replacement program (AMRP) rider. On discretionary review, the court considered whether PSC had the plenary authority to allow the utility to adjust its rates by imposing the surcharge or rider. The court reversed in part and held that so long as the rates established by the utility were fair, just, and reasonable, the PSC had broad ratemaking power to allow recovery of such costs outside the parameters of a general rate case and even in the absence of a statute specifically authorizing recovery of such costs. The PSC had the plenary authority to regulate and investigate utilities and to ensure that rates charged were fair, just, and reasonable under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 278.030 and 278.040. The plenary powers were sufficient to permit PCS to approve the AMRP rider even before the enactment of Ky. Rev.

The court remanded to the trial court with directions to reinstate the PSC orders allowing for the rider or surcharge.</SPAN></P>

The Board of Tax appeals dismissed the taxpayer's challenge to appellee administrator's 2001 property value assessment as untimely under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 133.120.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board of Tax Appeals found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 133.120 required the taxpayer to challenge a 2001 assessment during the 2001 inspection period. The trial court reversed the decision from the Board of Tax Appeals, and the Court of Appeals then reversed the trial court. This appeal followed. In affirming the Court of Appeals, the supreme court determined that the plain meaning of &sect; 133.120, with its reference to the inspection period, mandated that the taxpayer request a conference during the current tax year. Construing the statute's time frame for the conference to a period of days without a limitation to the current tax year would have produced an absurd result. Further, the statute of limitations set forth in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 134.590 was inapplicable. The taxpayer's due process deprivation claim was disingenuous. The taxpayer had to comply with the statutory language in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 134.590, which required the exhaustion of administrative remedies before applying for a refund. The taxpayer did not do so in this case because there was a failure to request the assessment conference under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 133.120(1)(a) during the same tax year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the Court of Appeals was affirmed. The case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the action in accordance with the decision from the Board of Tax Appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered his wife and their 8-year-old son by stabbing them with a kitchen knife and beating them with a dumbbell.

At sentencing, the trial court found two statutory aggravating factors and sentenced defendant to death. On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in failing to revisit the issue of competency after defendant offered to plead guilty because the desire to plead guilty and accept the death penalty did not, by itself, create reasonable grounds within the meaning of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 504.100(1), to question defendant's competency where no evidence demonstrated that defendant's mental health had deteriorated since the earlier competency hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Kentucky granted discretionary review of a decision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which held that district courts had no appellate jurisdiction and had to conduct a de novo trial as to a final order of the code enforcement board, but limiting the district court's review to making findings only from reviewing evidence introduced before the code enforcement board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was the scope of a district court's review of a decision of a local code enforcement board -- whether that review was de novo or of the record for an abuse of discretion in the form of an administrative appeal. Ky. Const. &sect; 113 and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann &sect; 24A.010(3) specifically limited a district court's jurisdiction to original jurisdiction. Because a district court had no appellate jurisdiction, a review of the record for an abuse of discretion must proceed in circuit court, the first court with appellate jurisdiction. Thus, that part of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 65.8831(1), which limited an appeal in district court to a review of the record created before the code enforcement board was unconstitutional on its face for assigning appellate jurisdiction to a district court. The specific language, &quot;The appeal shall be limited to a review of the record created before the code enforcement board.&quot; was therefore stricken. A district court could simply conduct a de novo trial per the statute, which would allow the court to supplement the record and hear arguments before ruling. Review of code enforcement board decisions were subject to de novo trials in district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed to the extent that it held that the district courts had no appellate jurisdiction and had to conduct a de novo trial as to the final order of the Code Enforcement Board; however, the judgment was reversed to the extent that it limited the district court's review to making findings only from reviewing evidence introduced before the Code Enforcement Board. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to various offenses and was sentenced to the felony pretrial diversion program. The Commonwealth filed a motion to remove him from pretrial diversion. the trial court dismissed the motion, stating that it lacked jurisdiction because the diversion period had ended. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) reversed. Defendant sought discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider the Commonwealth's appeal from the order denying revocation of the diversion agreement. Defendant claimed that the court of appeals erred in characterizing the trial court's order as &quot;final and appealable.&quot; The supreme court agreed. The trial court's order denied the motion to remove defendant from diversion because the trial court believed it lacked jurisdiction to do so. It did not purport to finally adjudicate the underlying charges. But, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22A.020(4) permitted the Commonwealth to appeal this interlocutory order. Defendant argued that &sect; 22A.020(4) violated Ky. Const. &sect; 2 because it conferred on the Commonwealth a right of appeal that the accused did not enjoy. The supreme court disagreed. The Commonwealth's right to appeal from an interlocutory order under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22A.020(4) was uniquely for the benefit of the Commonwealth. Nonetheless, the provision was reasonable because it furthered the Commonwealth's legitimate interest in the orderly administration of justice.</SPAN></P>

P. 9.30 encompassed the entire jury pool for the trial courts of a particular jurisdiction, not just the members of one panel assigned for operational and management purposes to a particular court. When the citizens were summoned for jury service, they were for a county's court system as one judicial system and not just for one division or court. The randomness was not affected when the trial court held the ten members back. The trial court did not create a situation where anyone would be able to know the names of the members that would eventually compose the jury. The trial court did not err in failing to strike a juror for cause where the juror testified that neither a previous fight nor the murder of her relative would affect how she would evaluate the evidence or how she would judge this case. Finally, defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that the search warrant contained a false statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant admitted that he murdered his wife and son by stabbing them and beating them with a dumbbell. Appellant entered a plea of guilty and accepted a sentence of death. A sentencing hearing was conducted, and the death sentence was imposed. This appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a motion under Ky. R. Crim. P. 8.06. Appellant had been found competent to stand trial just days earlier, and no new circumstances were presented that constituted reasonable grounds to question appellant's competency to plead guilty and request a death sentence. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.025(3) did not require that a sentencing jury or judge find beyond a reasonable doubt that capital punishment was appropriate. Moreover, appellant was able to waive jury sentencing under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.030(4), and there was no constitutional right to jury sentencing. A written transcript was not required for review because a video recording of the proceedings satisfied the requirements of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.075. Re-sentencing was not warranted in this case.</SPAN></P>

Acts 442 (H.B. 192) (Act), the court concluded that the criminal abuse statutes did not apply to a woman's conduct during pregnancy. To find otherwise would have created a situation in which a pregnant woman's conduct would have been subject to an indefinite number of new crimes covering the full range of a behavior - rendering the statutes void for vagueness. The legislature did not intend criminal sanctions for prenatal use of drugs and alcohol. The preamble of the Act clearly stated that taking punitive actions taken against pregnant alcohol or substance abusers would have created additional problems, including discouraging those individuals from seeking the essential prenatal care and substance abuse treatment necessary to deliver a healthy newborn. The court was not at liberty to ignore the legislative intent clearly expressed in the Act. The conduct alleged in the indictment did not constitute a crime; hence, the indictment was invalid on its face and properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant in a civil suit sought discovery of a Kentucky All-Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting (KASPER) record on the plaintiff in the suit. These records were held by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, which compiled them pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.202. The Commonwealth sought a writ of prohibition to bar enforcement of the order to disclose the materials. The circuit court ordered that the plaintiff's KASPER record be conditionally released to the defendant's attorney. The appellate court ordered the circuit court to first conduct an in camera review to determine what parts of the records, if any, were relevant discovery material before allowing any disclosure to the parties. The instant court concluded that the state legislature had the power to create privileges, such as to KASPER records, both from the instant court's own rules and from the legislature's inherent power to enact substantive law. Thus, the appellate court erred in finding that the KASPER statute violated the separation of powers doctrine. The KASPER statute created a privilege as to KASPER records, which the circuit court's discovery order would have violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the appellate court was reversed, and the case was remanded with instructions to issue the writ requested to bar enforcement of the circuit court's discovery order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee estate filed a declaratory judgment action against appellant widow to determine the ownership of a brokerage account. A trial court ruled that the account was a joint account with the right of survivorship and that on the decedent's death it passed entirely to the widow. The Kentucky Court of Appeals rejected that analysis and held that the decedent and the widow held the brokerage account as tenants in common. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate maintained that an ante-nuptial agreement between the decedent and the widow precluded her from having any interest in the brokerage account. The widow argued that the trial court correctly ruled that the entire brokerage account passed to her under the right of survivorship. The ante-nuptial agreement did provide that neither would claim any interest in the pre-marital property of the other. However, the court found that the agreement did not foreclose gifts from the decedent to the widow.  Further, while the nature of the decedent's gift to the widow was to be determined on remand, the agreement's requirement that the giver's intention be clearly memorialized was satisfied by the decedent's letter of authorization creating the joint account, notwithstanding the fact that the letter was not attached to the agreement. The statutory presumption on which the widow relied, that &quot;joint accounts&quot; under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 391.315 included the right of survivorship, did not apply to brokerage accounts. Because neither party was entitled to summary judgment, the dispute over the ownership of the account should have been remanded to the trial court for additional proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the court of appeals' opinion that neither party was entitled to summary judgment on the grounds they alleged but reversed the portion of the opinion granting summary judgment on different grounds as to the ownership of the brokerage account. The court remanded the matter to the trial court for additional proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the three offenses in 2003; in that trial, the jury found aggravating circumstances but did not recommend the death penalty. Instead, the jury recommended a life sentence. Defendant challenged his conviction, and the court reversed. On retrial, defendant was again convicted and this time was sentenced to death. On review, the court held that, under controlling Double Jeopardy precedent, because defendant's first trial concluded with a verdict fixing punishment at a life sentence, the Commonwealth was precluded from seeking the death penalty a second time. However, the trial court did not err under Ky. Const. &sect; 11 in refusing to strike a prospective juror who was a law enforcement officer and whose father and brother were law enforcement officers because her personal and familial connections with law enforcement did not render her implicitly biased in favor of the Commonwealth. Because the prospective juror had no personal acquaintance with the attorneys or police officers involved in the case and betrayed no tendency to lend heightened credence to police testimony, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to disqualify the juror.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Franklin Circuit Court, Kentucky, granted summary judgment in favor of appellee savings and loan association on its petition for a declaratory judgment against the Department of Financial Institutions (DFI).

The credit unions appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the sole question was whether the current version of the credit union membership statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 286.6-107, allowed geographic fields of membership for state-chartered credit unions. The supreme court found that the association's argument that the terms &quot;association&quot; and &quot;interest&quot; should be read as excluding geographic and other traditionally accepted fields of membership because of the departure from the model act was not convincing. The credit unions could not realistically argue that they fell under the association category. The term was not so expansive as to include mere geographical proximity. It did not include the traditional community field of membership. The credit unions did fit under the interest category. Persons who lived in the same neighborhood or rural farming district did have a concrete shared interest that demonstrated a common bond. Thus, a geographic or community field of membership was allowed under the current language of &sect; 286.6-107.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was appointed to the education council by one governor and when another governor was elected during appellant's term, he appointed the nominee to the same position while the general assembly was not in session. Appellant claimed that Ky. Const. &sect; 93 vested the senate with the sole power to confirm appointees. The court reversed and held that Ky. Const. &sect; 93 was ambiguous and that the inclusion of language permitting the senate to confirm nominees led to a strong presumption that the house was intentionally excluded from the confirmation process. The court found that the application of the expressio unius interpretive maxim led to a conclusion that the senate alone had the constitutional confirmation power under &sect; 93. Also, the most logical conclusion was that the term &quot;may&quot; in &sect; 93 signified only that the general assembly had the permissive discretion to choose which gubernatorial appointees must be subjected to a confirmation. However, while the trial court erred in dismissing appellant's complaint, the ultimate merits of were an entirely separate matter, which the parties had not yet had a full opportunity to either prove or defend.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a university and members of the Kentucky General Assembly, challenged a judgment of the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky), in an action filed by plaintiffs, an alliance, a teachers' association, and taxpayers, holding that a $ 10 million appropriation for the construction of pharmacy school building on the university's campus and a $ 1 million appropriation for a pharmacy scholarship program violated the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the pharmacy school appropriation for the university violated Ky. Const. &sect; 189 because it was an allocation of public funds for educational purposes to a church, sectarian, or denominational school, and the university was a Baptist university that had been supported by members and churches of the Baptist faith. The court further held that &sect; 189 did not offend the First Amendment by prohibiting appropriations of public tax monies to religious schools because there is no speech forum at issue where defendants allege discrimination in the expenditure of public funds for education. The court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 164.7901, which provided scholarship money to individual students who attended the university's pharmacy school, was a special legislation in contravention of Ky. Const. &sect; 59 because in restricting scholarships to those attending the university's pharmacy school, the Kentucky General Assembly failed to treat equally all members of the pharmacy student class, precisely the type of special privilege and favoritism that &sect; 59 condemned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court were two consolidated cases from the Kentucky Court of Appeals with the same issue: whether Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.043(5) violated the separation of powers doctrine of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27 and 28 by giving the judicial branch, rather than the executive branch, the power to revoke conditional discharge imposed after a period of incarceration. In both cases, the revocation of appellants' conditional discharge had been affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both appellants served out their initial sentences. Upon release, appellants were placed on three years conditional discharge  and referred to the Division of Probation and Parole for supervision. Both appellants violated the conditions of conditional discharge and were brought back to their respective sentencing courts for a revocation hearing. Appellants each argued to their trial court that the revocation procedure established &sect; 532.043(5) violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court agreed with appellants. Section 532.042(5) violated &sect;&sect; 27 and 28 of the Kentucky Constitution by impermissibly conferring an executive power to revoke a post-incarceration or post-parole conditional release upon the judiciary. Section 28 precluded one branch from exercising any power belonging to the other branches. Only on appeal of an administrative action should the judicial branch become involved in the executive branch's legitimate exercise of its power to execute sentences. The court noted that its ruling was limited to the revocation procedure in subsection (5). Because subsection (5) was severable from the remainder of the statute, the statute's other provisions remained in force.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the revocations in both cases and remanded the cases to their respective circuit courts for proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, adult entertainment business operators (operators), challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky holding that appellee county's 2004 amendments to its code of ordinances, which placed numerous restrictions on adult entertainment businesses, were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the county ordinance's &quot;no touch&quot; provision was unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment because prohibiting all touching between adult establishment customers and entertainers, including benign, nonsexual touching, was substantially broader than necessary to achieve the county's interest in combating prostitution and sexually transmitted diseases. An ordinance could be easily be more narrowly tailored to prohibit sexual touching, as in a ban on touching during a performance or while in a state of nudity. However, the court held that the provision prohibiting customers from directly tipping the entertainers was not unconstitutional because it did not deprive the entertainers of the ability to earn tips, as they could still be earned via a tip jar placed at the edge of the six-foot buffer zone. The provision prohibiting the sale of alcohol did not violate the 21st Amendment because under the Amendment, the State had broad power to regulate the times, places, and circumstances under which liquor could be sold.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed insofar as it held that the blanket &quot;no touch&quot; provision was constitutional. The judgment was otherwise affirmed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Bullitt Circuit Court (Kentucky) found defendant guilty of capital murder. The trial court sentenced defendant to death in accordance with the jury's recommendation. On appeal, the supreme court affirmed his capital murder conviction but reversed his death sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for a new capital sentencing trial. Following the new sentencing trial, defendant was again sentenced to death. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.025(2)(a)(1) required that defendant actually have the prior record of conviction for a capital offense at the time the instant offense of murder (or kidnapping) was committed. The trial court's instruction could have erroneously allowed a jury to find that aggravating factor even if defendant did not have a prior record of conviction of a capital offense at the time the instant offense was committed but, simply, had accrued such a prior record of conviction by the time of trial. Because the jury was presented with evidence of many convictions for capital offenses, some of which pre-dated the commission of the current murder and some of which did not, the instruction, as given, also deprived defendant of his right to a unanimous verdict. To avoid any possibility that the jury relied upon a non-qualifying conviction in finding the aggravator, in defendant's case and in similar future cases, the jury instruction had to require that the jury specifically identify the conviction that it used to find the aggravator. By specifically identifying qualifying convictions, the trial court could ensure that the jury did not rely on convictions that could not qualify.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed and vacated defendant's the death sentence and remanded the case for resentencing proceedings in conformity with the supreme court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Kentucky State Budget Director, sought review of a decision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which had dismissed her appeal because she failed to name an indispensible party to the appeal. Appellee, a financial institution, had set forth the action by alleging that a provision in an executive branch budget bill that shortened the escheat period for unredeemed traveler's checks for a two-year budget period was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Director contended that the lower court erred by dismissing her appeal for failure to name the State Treasurer as a party to the appeal. She claimed that her notice of appeal did effectively name the Treasurer by having named the Department of Treasury in the caption. The court agreed and held that because the Department of Treasury did not itself appeal, as a non-appealing party, it was properly listed in the appellee's position in the caption. It was determined that naming a party in the caption of the notice was, standing alone, sufficient to satisfy the notice requirement even though the party was not named in the body of the notice. There was no other reasonable purpose for listing the Department of Treasury in the caption except to name it as a party to the appeal. As such, the listing gave fair notice to the financial institution that the Director was naming the Department of Treasury as a party to the appeal. Accordingly, the lower court erred by dismissing the appeal for failure to name the Treasurer as a party to the appeal.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;17.170 through 17.175 (2002), required them to submit DNA for inclusion in a state and national database, arguing tha the requirement violated their rights under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Kentucky's DNA sampling statutes require convicted felons to submit DNA samples for inclusion in a database to help law enforcement agencies identify perpetrators of violent crimes.

After the juveniles in the instant case were adjudicated delinquent for committing various sex crimes, they were ordered to submit a DNA sample. They petitioned for a writ of prohibition, but the circuit court found in favor of appellee, the Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ), and the appellate court affirmed. On review, the court held that the Fourth Amendment privacy interests of juveniles adjudicated public offenders, while greater than those of convicted adults, did not outweigh the State's and DJJ's legitimate interests in establishing and maintaining a DNA database to aid in solving crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sought to have Kentucky's self-defense statutes, as they existed at the time of his 1991 trial, declared unconstitutional under Ky. Const. &sect; 1. The trial court determined that there was no actual case or controversy as stated in the declaratory judgment petition. The trial court dismissed the petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted. An appeal was filed, and a transfer was granted because the proceeding implicated a case in which the death sentence was imposed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that the petition failed to plead an existing actual controversy. The constitutionality of the self-defense statutes had no foreseeable application to the inmate; he was incarcerated in a maximum security prison subject to six death sentences. The adjudication of this issue would have amounted to no more than an advisory opinion. It was noted that the declaratory judgment procedure was excluded from the post-conviction process. Piecemeal litigation though successive declaratory judgment actions was precluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, employers subject to the Kentucky Workers' Compensation Act, sought a declaration of rights and injunctive relief against appellants, the Governor of Kentucky and the State Budget Director, contending that budgetary actions violated Ky. Const. &sect; 15, 51, and 180. The trial court (Kentucky) granted the employers' motion for partial summary judgment. The parties' cross-appeals were transferred from the Court of Appeals (Kentucky).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers complained about transfers of millions of dollars from the Kentucky Workers' Compensation Funding Commission (KWCFC) and the Workers' Compensation Benefit Reserve Fund (BRF) to the general fund and to the mining budget. The trial court upheld the questioned budgetary acts under Ky. Const. &sect; 180 but invalidated them under Ky. Const. &sect; 51. On appeal, the court held that the annual transfer of $ 19 million to the general fund did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 180, but it held that the other transfers were invalid because the funds were commingled and could not be differentiated. Under Armstrong, the transfer of funds actually held in agency accounts in which public funds and private contributions were commingled and could not be differentiated, could not be considered a valid suspension of the operation of a statute under Ky. Const. &sect; 15 and Ky. Const. &sect; 51. Nevertheless, the transfer or diversion of funds which had not yet been received by the KWCFC and BRF were not commingled agency funds. Finally, the continuance of the employers' assessment rate of 11.5 percent was not a tax subject to the publication provision of Ky. Const. &sect; 51.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the determination that the budget acts were valid under Ky. Const. &sect; 180 and its decision supported by Armstrong. It reversed the decision under Ky. Const. &sect; 51 that the legislature could not properly (1) suspend the $ 19 million annual appropriation to the KWCFC and the BRF to the extent the funds had yet to be transferred to them, or (2) mandate the continuance of the employers' assessment rate. It then remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

Further, the trial court did not err in refusing to grant a directed verdict on the endangerment charge under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 508.060 because the murder occurred in close proximity to the bassinet in which the infant lay and bullets were found near the bassinet.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Franklin Circuit Court, Kentucky, refused appellant Kentucky Attorney General's request for a temporary injunction, which would have temporarily enjoined appellee Kentucky Department of Corrections (DOC) from implementing House Bill (HB) 406 in an allegedly retroactive manner. The Pulaski Circuit court granted a permanent injunction prohibiting DOC from releasing any prisoner or parolee. The case was transferred to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court had to determine whether the trial court erred when it concluded that the DOC improperly applied HB 406, 2008 Ky. Acts 127, retroactively. The supreme court noted that Pulaski Circuit Court had jurisdiction over both the subject matter and the parties involved in the action. It had powers co-extensive with the Franklin Circuit Court to adjudicate the matter. Since the General Assembly appropriated even less money than the DOC projected to save through the retroactive application of the street time credit, there could be no legitimate contention that more spending was intended. The Pulaski Circuit Court erred when it determined that the General Assembly did not intend HB 406 to have retroactive effect. A writ of prohibition should issue against the Pulaski Circuit Court. The Attorney General had a sufficient personal right in these types of cases by virtue of the office and the duties commensurate with that high office. The information provided to juries under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.055 was unaffected by HB 406. There was no separation of powers violation, Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27 and 28. HB 406 did not violate Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 197.045.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Franklin Circuit Court, Kentucky, convicted defendants of murder and sentenced them to death in 1991 and 1994. The circuit court rejected defendants' challenge to Kentucky's lethal injection protocol on several grounds including the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Ky. Const. &sect; 17. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants argued that the lethal injection protocol was unenforceable because it was not properly adopted as an administrative regulation in accordance with Kentucky's Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The supreme court found that they were required to join all claims regarding implementation of their sentences of execution in their original declaratory judgment action, and they were precluded from reserving arguments for subsequent actions. Res judicata barred consideration of the second declaratory judgment action filed by two defendants. The third defendant had not previously filed an action challenging the implementation of his death sentence and consequently his APA claim was cognizable. The APA mandated that the lethal injection protocol be promulgated as a regulation to the extent if affected private rights. It had to be properly adopted pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 13A before appellee Kentucky Department of Corrections proceeded with further executions. When a matter had to be prescribed by administrative regulation pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13A.100, the APA had to be complied with in all respects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to the dismissal of two defendants' claims because of res judicata; the judgment was reversed as to the third defendant as the Department of Corrections was required to promulgate a regulation as to all portions of the lethal injection protocol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) that convicted him of two counts of rape in the first degree in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 510.040 and one count of intimidating a participant in the legal process under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 524.040(1)(f), arguing that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on lesser-included offenses and in imposing consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on first-degree sexual abuse under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 510.110(1)(b)(2) as a lesser-included offense of rape because the former was not a lesser-included offense where the young victim's testimony was unequivocal that defendant inserted his penis into her vagina and defendant did not controvert her testimony. Although the victim also testified regarding an instance during which defendant removed her clothing and touched her vagina but did not rape her, this testimony did not warrant a lesser-included offense instruction because the testimony did not contradict the testimony of sexual penetration but was merely testimony regarding a separate, uncharged offense. However, error occurred in sentencing defendant because the retroactive application of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.110(1)(d) was prohibited by the ex post facto clauses of the state and federal constitutions, Ky. Const. &sect; 19 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. By removing the possibility of concurrent sentences, &sect; 532.110(1)(d) created a new standard of punishment that was more onerous than that under the former statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer filed suit against the restaurant after contracting hepatitis A. The restaurant moved to dismiss under the statute of limitations because the customer's suit was filed three years after he fell ill.

The court of appeals reversed, ruling that the suit was barred under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.140(1)(a) because it was not filed within one year of the alleged negligence. On review, the court held that the statute of limitations was tolled by operation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.190(2) due to the restaurant's active concealment of an employee's hygiene, work habits, and hepatitis A infection. The record demonstrated that the restaurant manager suppressed the fact of the employee's hepatitis A infection in responding to a health department investigation; as such, the statute of limitations was tolled for the entire period of concealment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kenton District Court, Kentucky, concluded that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.545, the sex offender registration statute, as applied to defendant, violated the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Kentucky Constitutions. The Commonwealth moved the Kentucky Supreme Court for certification of law to determine whether the statute was an ex post fact punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that to violate the ex post facto clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Ky. Const. &sect; 19(1), Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.545 had to be punitive. The supreme court concluded that the General Assembly intended &sect; 17.545 to be a civil, nonpunitive, regulatory scheme. The residency restrictions in the statute had been regarded in Kentucky history and traditions as punishment. By imposing restraints based solely upon prior offenses, &sect; 17.545 promoted and furthered retribution against sex offenders for their past crimes. A registrant could not establish a permanent home. The statute was connected to public safety. However, its inherent flaws prevented that connection from being &quot;rational.&quot; The magnitude of restraint involved in residency restrictions was sufficient for a lack of individual assessment to render the statute punitive. Given the drastic consequences of Kentucky's residency restrictions, and the fact that there was no individual determination of the threat a particular registrant posed to public safety, &sect; 17.545 was excessive with respect to the nonpunitive purpose of public safety. Section 17.545 was excessive with respect to the purpose of public safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Jessamine Circuit Court (Kentucky) that convicted her of multiple counts of wanton murder and several other charges stemming from a car accident in which she had been driving while under the influence of alcohol, arguing that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress blood-alcohol evidence where the blood sample was taken at the hospital by the police while she was unconscious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After drinking with a friend, defendant was driving home when she was involved in an accident that led to the death of four of her passengers. Defendant was transported to a hospital where deputies took a blood sample without a warrant and without her consent. After her suppression motion was denied, defendant pled guilty to the charges against her but reserved her right to contest the trial court's ruling on her motion. On review, the court held that, under the implied consent law, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 189A.103, drivers in Kentucky consented to alcohol concentration testing, and the fact that defendant was unconscious did not constitute a withdrawal of her consent. However, before a blood alcohol test could be performed, the deputies were required to have probable cause to believe that alcohol was involved in the wreck. If the blood test was done merely because there were fatalities, the lack of probable cause rendered the testing unlawful under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV. Because the trial court did not engage in a sufficient analysis to determine whether probable cause existed, its denial of defendant's suppression motion could not stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was vacated, and the case was remanded for a new suppression hearing to determine whether the evidence established that the police had probable cause to believe that alcohol played a role in the accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the McCracken Circuit Court (Kentucky) that convicted him of numerous criminal offenses, arguing that the trial court erred by substituting an alternate juror for a juror who was excused after the case had been submitted to the jury for deliberation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after the case was submitted to the jury, the trial judge announced that one of the jurors had previously been excused by the chief judge. Although the alternate juror had been excused, the trial court ordered that he be located and return to join the already-deliberating jury.  On review, the court held that reinstating a discharged alternate juror during deliberations, absent defendant's consent, required reversal of a conviction only when defendant was prejudiced by the procedure. However, assurance that the alternate juror remained qualified to serve was a prerequisite to substitution and, unless waived by defendant, had to be established on the record. Because the trial court failed to do so, the court was left to speculate about whether the recalled juror was free of outside taint. Further, the trial court erred in failing to instruct the newly reconstituted jury to begin its deliberations anew once the alternate juror was added to the panel. Absent such an instruction, the court could not determine whether the jury began its deliberations anew or whether the new juror simply acceded to a decision already made by the original jurors during prior deliberations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Taylor Circuit Court, Kentucky, denied defendant's motion to suppress and found defendant guilty of all charges, recommending a sentence of twelve months with a $500 fine for the possession of marijuana conviction, and a twenty-year sentence for the first-degree persistent felony offender (PFO) conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the officers overstepped constitutional bounds when they frisked him for weapons. The supreme court noted that once the driver of the vehicle was lawfully arrested, the officer had the authority to search the passenger compartment of the vehicle. An officer could order a passenger to exit the vehicle pending completion of a minor traffic stop. An officer could order a passenger to exit a vehicle while that vehicle was searched incident to the lawful arrest of the driver. Under the automatic companion rule, all companions of the arrestee within the immediate vicinity, capable of accomplishing a harmful assault on the officer, were constitutionally subjected to the cursory pat-down reasonably necessary to give assurance that they were unarmed. The supreme court found that adoption of the automatic companion rule protected the officer, and was designed to apply only in situations in which the driver of a vehicle has been lawfully arrested and the passengers had been lawfully expelled in preparation for a lawful search of the vehicle. Only in those limited circumstances could an officer conduct a brief pat-down for weapons of the vehicle's passengers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Kentucky Department of Revenue, challenged a decision of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky that held that amendments to Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations originally filed separate state tax returns. After a ruling that related corporations could file a combined tax return under the unitary business concept, the corporations substituted combined returns. Because they owed less tax under this approach and would be entitled to tax refunds and because the adoption of this practice by a multitude of related corporations would result in significant revenue loss to the state, the legislature amended Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 141.120 and 141.200 to bar combined returns and to deny refunds for amended combined returns. The corporations challenged the amendments, arguing that they were deprived of a vested property interest in the tax refunds. On review, the court held that, because the amendments made to the Kentucky tax code were made to clarify the law regarding combined returns under the unitary business plan and to exercise the legislature's revenue raising power, the amendments furthered a legitimate government interests and were rationally related to that purpose. As such, the corporations' due process rights were not affected by the amendments' retroactive application, and they were not entitled to refunds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with theft of services over $ 300.00, in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 514.050. The circuit court granted the motion of the Commonwealth of Kentucky to dismiss the charge without prejudice. Defendant filed a motion to amend the order of dismissal, asking that the dismissal be deemed to be with prejudice. The court denied the motion. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky affirmed the decision. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The essence of the offense was that defendant unlawfully received electricity for her business by diverting it through an illegally placed, hidden wire from a neighboring electric meter. She argued that the trial judge abused his discretion by refusing to convert the dismissal from without prejudice to with prejudice. She claimed that she was prejudiced by the dismissal because she was then unable to demand a trial that would clear her name, and she was unable to have the arrest expunged from her record. The state supreme court found that Ky. R. Civ. P. 41.01 could not be extended to criminal cases as Ky. R. Crim. P. 9.64 covered the matter of voluntary dismissals of criminal cases. Further, the requested dismissal with prejudice would have violated the separation of powers doctrine embodied in Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27 and 28. Finally, it was not within the province of the circuit court, under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 505.030, to grant defendant's request to designate the dismissal with prejudice because she made no claim of the deprivation of a statutory right or a principle of Constitutional law which foreclosed a future attempt to prosecute her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of first-degree manslaughter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court first concluded that the Commonwealth's use of the post-arrest statements of defendant and his codefendant did not entitle defendant to a separate trial and did not infringe upon his right to present a defense. Codefendant's statement was redacted to remove any reference to defendant. The limited introduction of defendant's own statement did not infringe on defendant's right to present a defense, as the portion not admitted was not critical to his defense. The supreme court further concluded that defendant's self-defense claim was correctly presented to the jury according to the law as it existed at the time of defendant's offense, and his claim of immunity under newly enacted Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 503.085, which applied only prospectively, was properly denied. Finally, the supreme court concluded that the jury was fairly selected and was correctly instructed with respect to defendant's right not to testify, his presumed innocence, and the Commonwealth's burden of proof. Among other things, the trial court properly rejected defendant's fair cross section challenge, as he made no attempt to show that African-Americans were regularly underrepresented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owners sued appellants, the fire department, the fire chief, and the city, for negligence regarding a fire on the owners' property. The trial court dismissed the case on grounds of immunity. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky reversed the trial court as to the fire department and the city. The intermediate appellate court also remanded the matter of the fire chief's qualified official immunity. Discretionary review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners alleged that the fire department, its fire chief, and the city were negligent in failing to timely extinguish a fire and that the owners suffered more severe property damage than they otherwise would have if additional measures had been taken to extinguish the fire. The state supreme court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 75.070 and 95.830(2) were constitutional under Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 230 and 231 and that they did not violate the jural rights doctrine under Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 14, 54, and 241. Further, the city was entitled to dismissal because the fire department was an agent of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, having been recognized as such by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75.070 and declared immune from suit in tort. Because fire departments were thus immune from suit in tort, and were agents of the Commonwealth, albeit operating on a local basis, there was no attendant municipality liability for the fire department's firefighting actions. This was also consistent with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 95.830(2). Additionally, the fire chief was immune in his official capacity. However, in his individual capacity, he was entitled to qualified official immunity for his discretionary acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the intermediate appellate court was reversed, and the decision of the trial court, albeit, in some instances, for different reasons was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Graves Circuit Court (Kentucky), which convicted him of two counts of second-degree sodomy and three counts of first-degree sexual abuse. Defendant raised various issues on appeal, including his contention that the trial court improperly admitted testimony about Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS) from various witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child victim alleged that defendant, her step-father, sexually abused her on a weekly basis for a period of six years. The court held that the trial court erred when it allowed a clinical psychologist to testify that sexually abused children, like the victim, commonly added details over time through counseling and erred in allowing the psychologist to identify generic characteristics of child sex abuse victims by describing them as outwardly appearing happy as this testimony did not answer the question of whether other children who had not been similarly abused might also develop the same symptoms or traits. This testimony was not relevant under Ky. R. Evid. 401; thus, the admission of CSAAS testimony was improper and required the reversal of defendant's conviction. The trial court also erred in sentencing defendant to 35 years in prison rather than the maximum twenty-year sentence under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 532.110(1)(c) and 532.080(6)(b) as the 35-year-sentence exceeded in length the longest extended term authorized by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.080 for the Class C felony conviction of second-degree sodomy, the highest class of crimes of which defendant was convicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, defendant entered a conditional guilty plea to the offense of failure to comply with sex offender registration, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.510(10)(a), and was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment, probated for five years. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky affirmed the conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was expelled from a center where he had been living, and became homeless. Defendant made no attempt to report to the proper authorities when he moved away from the center. Defendant argued that Ky. Rev. Stat.

The appellate court found that the fact that defendant became homeless was irrelevant to the statute's application. The focus of &sect; 17.510(10)(a) was that any change in a sex offender's address be reported to the proper authorities. Nowhere in the plain language of the statute did it require that the registrant must have had an actual place he was moving to. Thus &sect; 17.510(10)(a) was not void for vagueness as applied to defendant. There was no reason why defendant could not have reported to the proper authorities that he no longer lived at the center. Further, &sect; 17.510(10)(a) as written did not cause arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement and did not criminalize being homeless. All sex offenders, regardless of socioeconomic status, had to register with the proper authorities and report any change in address.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of failure to register as a sex offender in Kentucky, under former Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.510(7), based on his conviction of a sex crime in Tennessee and subsequent failure to register in Kentucky, upon moving to Kentucky. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) reversed the conviction, and the Commonwealth appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was reversed because he was not notified to register. The supreme court held he was properly convicted because he had to register in Tennessee and, thus, was subject to former Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.510(7). A failure to notify him, under former Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.510(6), was irrelevant because Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.510(7) imposed an absolute duty to register, once he moved to Kentucky, and did not require the Commonwealth to notify him of this duty. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it sufficiently notified him that, if he did not register, he would be guilty of a crime. If evidence that he was a registered sex offender in Tennessee was hearsay, admitting it was harmless because other admissible evidence proved this. The erroneous admission of testimony that he worked in Kentucky was harmless because other witnesses confirmed it. The fact that he was convicted of a sex crime before the effective date of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.510(11), as amended in 2000, did not cause the trial court to lack jurisdiction to convict him of a felony because he did not have to register until he moved to Kentucky, after the statute was amended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeals was reversed, and defendant's conviction was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant filed an application for benefits, alleging that he suffered from coal workers' pneumoconiosis, but he did not allege a respiratory impairment. The claimant and his employer filed a chest x-ray and a &quot;B&quot; reader's interpretation of the x-ray. The Office of Workers' Claims determined that the parties' reports were not in consensus and pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(3)(b)(4)(e), hired three &quot;B&quot; readers to choose and interpret the best quality x-ray. The panel reached a consensus of category 0. In rebuttal, the claimant filed another interpretation of the x-ray that he submitted initially. The ALJ dismissed the claim. The supreme court held that &sect; 342.316(3)(b)(4)(e) denied the claimant equal protection because it discriminated between him and a similarly-situated worker whose employer also submitted evidence of category 1 disease but whose claim was not subject to the second phase of the consensus process. Section 342.316(3)(b)(4)(e) created two classes of workers based solely on the amount of discrepancy between the worker's and employer's evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee retirees sued appellant county, seeking health insurance coverage under former Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, Ky., Ordinance No. 217-99 (1999) and challenging the constitutionality of an amendment to that ordinance. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky affirmed the trial court's ruling that the retirees were covered under the prior ordinance, and held that the amended version was unconstitutional. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retirees opted out of health coverage when they retired. The issues were whether former Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, Ky., Ordinance No. 217-99 (1999) provided an opportunity for them to opt back into coverage, and whether the amended version of that ordinance, Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, Ky., Ordinance No. 217-99 (2000), which excluded the retirees from coverage, was valid. The appellate court found, contrary to the retirees' claim, that former Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, Ky., Ordinance No. 217-99(c) (1999) was meant to exclude someone, otherwise it would have been meaningless. No patent ambiguity existed in that subsection, which excluded the retirees. Benefits were payable to only those individuals who retired before July 1, 1999, and were participants in the health plan. The amendments showed clearly that only those participants who had not opted out of the plan before the time the 1999 ordinance became effective, July 1, 1999, were eligible. The protective cross-appeal in the intermediate appellate court concerned the constitutionality of the 2000 ordinance, which became moot with this interpretation of the 1999 ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant counties challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which affirmed a decision of appellee, the Kentucky Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, to grant a retail drink license to appellee business. At issue was the measurement method set forth in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 241.075. The counties had appealed the decision to the trial court. The business cross-appealed to challenge the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 241.075 prohibited the issuance of a retail drink license to an applicant located within 700 feet of another similar establishment. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision to grant the business's application by declaring that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 241.075 was special or local legislation in violation of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 59 and 60, meaning that the Board had not erred insofar that it found the distance between the business and the other similar establishments was not a bar to granting the application. The court determined that the Board's interpretation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 189.570, addressing pedestrian crossings, was incorrect but that the incorrect interpretation did not undermine the final conclusion to grant the license since the Board's decision was irrespective of the legal pedestrian laws. Further, since the Court found sufficient reason to affirm the Board's decision within the standard process of judicial review of an administrative agency's decision, the constitutional issue did not have to be addressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant metro government as successor to a first-class city appealed a judgment by the Court of Appeals (Kentucky) that gave annexation priority to a fourth-class city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both the first-class city and the fourth-class city sought to annex the property in question. Although the first-class city's annexation ordinance (first reading) was first in time, the trial court ruled the delay in completing the annexation was unreasonable, and that reintroduction of the first reading every six months did not relate back to the first reading. The Court of Appeals agreed that the true first reading was after the reintroduction requirement for annexation ordinances was removed. Therefore, the first-class city's proposed annexation ordinance lost priority over the fourth-class city's ordinance. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that because the first-class city had a cooperative agreement in effect, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 81A.005 gave it priority to annex the property in question. In addition, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79.310, as amended, allowed the first-class city 22 years to complete the annexation process. Because that statutory period had not expired before the fourth-class city's ordinance was enacted, its annexation ordinance was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendants first went to trial, the trial court declared a mistrial soon after the jury was sworn. After a second joint jury trial, defendants were found guilty of murder, attempted murder, and assault in the second degree. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) sentenced defendants to 30 years' imprisonment. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First defendant argued that the second trial violated his double jeopardy rights under Ky. Const. &sect; 13, and U.S. Const. Amends. V and XIV. The supreme court agreed, holding that jeopardy attached when the jury was sworn for the first trial. The supreme court also found no showing of manifest necessity supporting the grant of a mistrial. The supreme court found that the proffered newly discovered evidence, a witness who would testify that second defendant tried to sell him a gun on the day of the shooting, was cumulative. The Commonwealth already had two witnesses to testify that they had made earlier statements to police that second defendant shot at them. The supreme court further concluded that the relative weight of the Commonwealth's late-discovered witness merited only exclusion or a continuance, not a mistrial. While second defendant did not raise a double jeopardy objection in his brief, the supreme court addressed the issue under the palpable error rule, and found a such error, making his conviction a violation of double jeopardy as well. Contrary to the Commonwealth's claim, defendants were not required to object to the mistrial to preserve the issue for review.</SPAN></P>

The trial court in the first county granted defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment. The Commonwealth then indicted defendant in the second county. The trial court in the second county overruled defendant's double jeopardy objection. Defendant later entered a conditional plea to the sexual abuse charge, and was sentenced. The appellate court held that double jeopardy did not bar defendant's second county prosecution and affirmed his conviction. The state supreme court found that he was not entitled to dismissal of the second county indictment because jeopardy had not attached during his first trial county; trial there was simply in the wrong venue, which was not jurisdictional, and no double jeopardy prohibition attached under either Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant workers' compensation claimant filed a motion to reopen her claim for workers' compensation benefits. The claimant appealed a Kentucky Court of Appeals' opinion affirming a decision of the Kentucky Workers' Compensation Board denying the motion as untimely because Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.125(3)'s four-year statute of limitation for motions to reopen was to be calculated only from the date of the original award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the claimant was receiving temporary total disability benefits and had not reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) when the limitation period allegedly ran. She could not have avoided the limitation period by pre-filing and then abating the motion to reopen until she reached MMI. Putting together the 803 Ky. Admin. Regs. 25:010, &sect; 4(6)(a) documentation could only begin after MMI was attained. The evidentiary standards for reopening were controlled by &sect; 342.125(3) on the date of injury, but the limitation period was governed by a 1996 amendment. The reference in &sect; 342.125(3) to the &quot;the original award or order granting or denying benefits&quot; referred to the original award and any subsequent order granting or denying benefits. The claimant's motion to reopen was timely. Cruse v. Aristech Chemical Co., No. 2004-SC-0291-WC, 2005 WL 119771, (January 20, 2005), Cook v. Unicorn Min., No. 2003-SC-0616-WC, 2004 WL 1908114, (August 26, 2004), and Wray v. Allied Systems, No. 2004-SC-002122-WC, 2005 WL 1058862, (Ky. App. 2005), were reversed. Finally, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 342.320 and 342.310, and Ky. R. Civ. P. 11 deterred the filing of frivolous motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the appellate court was reversed. The matter was remanded to the Board for such further proceedings as were necessary and appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the Ky. R. Crim. P. 10.06 and Ky. R. Civ. P. 60.02(f) claims were untimely and that the statute of limitations had not begun to run on the Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42 claim. The Commonwealth appealed and the inmate cross appealed the issue of timeliness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had not addressed, in a published opinion, whether the Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42 limitation statute applied to the inmate's claims of mental incompetence and ineffective assistance of counsel, but it held that, for purposes of post-conviction relief, a youthful offender's original sentencing order was a final judgment and that the inmate's motion was untimely--it was filed more than three years after sentencing. Reports filed at the 18-year-old hearing indicated that his mental condition stabilized during juvenile detention, that he meaningfully participated in group therapy, and that he earned a high school diploma. In adult corrections, he was treated with more effective medication and earned credits towards an associate's degree. In light of his intermittent competence, his condition did not prevent compliance with the Rule 11.42 such that equitable tolling was appropriate. To interpret information previously suppressed as unknown facts under Rule 11.42(10)(a) would set an explosive precedent. Rule 11.42 was constitutional because it did not restrict access to habeas relief pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.020 or Ky. Const. &sect; 16; rather, it existed simultaneously.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the holding that the statute of limitations was tolled until the inmate attained the age of eighteen and reversed the opinion of the appellate court as to the inmate's motion. The court affirmed affirm appellate court as to the Ky. R. Civ. P. 60.02 and Ky. R. Crim. P. 10.02 motions, and reinstated the circuit court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee claimed that she was transferred to a less desirable office as retaliation for reporting a document purge by employees of the state agency. When the employee's attorney contacted an attorney for the state agency, another state agency conducted an investigation of the matter, but concluded that there was no wrongdoing. The intermediate appellate court concluded that the state agency was not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, because an internal report to the state agency qualified as a report to any other appropriate body or authority under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61.102. The state supreme court found that the evidence presented a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was a causal connection between the employee's report and her transfer. The case also presented a genuine issue of material fact as to the ultimate issue: whether the employee was retaliated against as a result of her report. These were questions for a jury. Additionally, the employee made her report to her own division of the agency, which certainly had the power to remedy the situation. Therefore, it could not be said that the state agency was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was affirmed. The partial summary judgment in favor of the state agency on the whistleblower claim was vacated and remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three consolidated appeals, appellant coal workers sought review of decisions of the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which affirmed the denial of their pneumoconiosis claims by the Workers' Compensation Board. The workers claimed that the consensus procedure in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316 violated equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 1, 2, and 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the procedure in &sect; 342.316(3), the workers and appellee employers each submitted a chest X-ray and a &quot;B&quot; reader's interpretation of the X-ray. Because the parties' reports in each case were not in consensus, the X-rays were then interpreted by a panel of three &quot;B&quot; readers pursuant to &sect; 342.316(3)(b)4.e.; each panel determined the best quality X-ray in evidence was negative. The workers claimed that the consensus procedure discriminated unlawfully between workers who were injured by a harmful occupational exposure to coal dust and those who became physically disabled by a traumatic injury. The court affirmed. The inherent differences in the disease/injuries provided a reasonable basis for the different statutory treatment. Section 342.316(13) did not impose a greater burden of proof than on those workers who claimed benefits under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.730 as the presumption in the consensus procedure was a rebuttable one that could be overcome with clear and convincing evidence. The existence and category of pneumoconiosis were proven with x-ray evidence, but the evidence necessary to prove the existence and extent of a traumatic injury varied with the type of injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an inmate with an IQ of 79, was convicted of multiple murders, attempted murder, and robbery, and was sentenced to death. He asserted a post-conviction collateral attack on his sentence under Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42, alleging in part ineffective assistance of counsel. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing and upheld the inmate's sentence. He appealed as a matter of right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was accused of stabbing his cousin and assaulting her sons after he had spent the day smoking crack cocaine. The court upheld the denial of relief. First, the inmate should have attacked a ruling that he was not exempt from the death penalty because of mental retardation on his direct appeal. Nevertheless, an IQ of 70 was the cut-off for mental retardation in Atkins and Kentucky's statutory scheme for applying Atkins, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 532.130 -.140. Second, counsel conducted a reasonable investigation into his intellectual capacity and introduced sufficient evidence of such during the penalty phase. Third, the jury instructions did not impermissibly limit consideration of his intellectual limitations as mitigating evidence. Fourth, although counsel failed to introduce mitigation evidence from a retained expert about the inmate's lack of future dangerousness in prison, they presented a jail chaplain on that issue. Finally, counsel's failure to introduce evidence of his low intellectual function at a hearing to suppress his police confession was not unreasonable when there was no evidence of police coercion and the law at the time focused on police coercion.</SPAN></P>

After the appeals were completed, the trial court entered an order enforcing its judgment which included, pursuant to a 10% penalty for $950,000. In an earlier appeal, the court held that the statutory penalty was unconstitutional and that appellee was entitled to restitution of the $950,000. After remand, the circuit court entered an order for restitution, but did not allow interest on the $950,000. The appellate court reversed, and appellant sought review with the court. The court noted that while the appeals were pending appellant had the unfettered use of $950,000 for over four years and there was nothing in the record that would suggest that there was any equitable reason to require anything other than full restitution. To make appellee whole, appellant needed to pay interest on the $950,000 from the date that it first had use of that money.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged on appeal that: (1) Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 439.3401 was unconstitutional; (2) the trial court abused its discretion by sentencing him to a more onerous sentence than that recommended by the jury; and (3) his convictions for both sodomy and sexual abuse violated his double jeopardy rights. The appeals court disagreed. First, the constitutional argument was not preserved for appellate review. Likewise, defendant could still be characterized as a violent offender despite the fact that the trial court's final judgment did not specifically designate him as such. Third, the trial court was not required to follow the jury's recommendation as to the method of serving a sentence. Fourth, a reasonable juror could have inferred that the touching of the victim's genitals through the victim's clothing was for the purposes of defendant's own sexual gratification, as he had previously orally sodomized the victim. Further, defendant similarly touched other young boys' genitals through their clothing. Finally, his act of touching the victim's genitals was an entirely separate act and offense than his orally sodomizing the victim. Hence, there was no double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the Kentucky General Assembly intended to add an exemption for all sales of artificial devices prescribed by a licensed physician, or if it intended only to expand somewhat the prior exemption for sales to crippled persons by including not only devices designed and altered for them but also devices prescribed for their particular use as braces, supports, or similar purposes. The instant court agreed with the Board that the 1986 version of Ky. Rev. Stat.

The supreme court held that the circuit court properly applied the three-step process for evaluating defendant's Batson challenge. However, the circuit court abused its discretion in failing to excuse a juror for cause. The juror should have been stricken for cause because he indicated that he would believe the testimony of a police officer simply because he was a police officer, and that police officers had greater credibility in their testimony than other witnesses. The totality of the juror's responses formed a reasonable basis to conclude that he could not consider all the mitigation evidence that the law demanded. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements he made to police. The circuit court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress because detectives properly provided defendant with his Miranda warnings before beginning systematic questioning. Defendant made the statements before he was arrested, and he was not in custody prior to his arrest.</SPAN></P>

It then found that the alleged father did not have standing to file the petition and the family court lacked jurisdiction under the Uniform Act on Paternity because there was no claim the child had been born out of wedlock given that there was no evidence or allegation that the husband and wife's marital relationship ceased 10 months before the child's birth, as set forth in Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) awarded damages to appellee customers on their claims filed under the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act (Act) against appellant, a used car dealer (dealer). On appeal, the Court of Appeals held that the customers qualified as purchasers under the Act, affirmed the punitive damages award, but vacated the common-law fraud verdict and inconvenience damages award. Thus, the dealer sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer asserted as its principal issue on appeal that the jury verdict on the claims filed under the Act had to be overturned because the customers based their claims on an incomplete sale transaction, meaning that they were not purchasers because they never actually purchased goods from the dealer. But, the instant court first found that the jury's verdict on the claims under the Act was proper. Hence, it declined to address the common-law fraud issue. Second, the customers were eligible to bring an action under the Act as purchasers, as they had an equitable interest in the purchased vehicle equal to the value of their trade in, despite the lack of a binding contract. Third, the court declined to make any finding regarding liability for future promises, such as financing guarantees, as the case did not require the court to determine whether any liability for future predictions was possible under the Act and because the issue was not argued to the trial court. Fourth, punitive damages were properly awarded and were not excessive. Finally, the inconvenience awards were not duplicative of the loss of use award. Thus, it was improperly vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That part of the Court of Appeals' opinion that affirmed the judgment of the trial court was upheld, and the court did not reach the question as to the propriety of the fraud verdict. But, that part of the Court of Appeals' opinion that vacated that portion of the trial court's judgment was reversed. Thus, the trial court's judgment was reinstated entirely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city police officer arrested the first defendant and the second defendant for drug-related offenses at a residence located outside the city limits but within the county limits.

The trial court agreed with the first defendant and the second defendant, and dismissed the indictments. The appellate court agreed with the trial court's decision and affirmed. The state supreme court found that an earlier municipal order, which amended sections of the city's personnel system and provided that city police were to remain within the city limits unless an emergency arose, did not affect the police officer's county-wide arrest powers under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 95.019(1). Rather, the state supreme court found that the municipal order, though valid, was meant to keep police officers in the city and the violation of it did not make the arrests unlawful; instead, the violation of it could subject a city police officer to employment disciplinary action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a vehicle driven by a driver, who was arrested for driving with a suspended license, and was found to possess a crack pipe in a search incident to the arrest. Defendant was asked to step outside the vehicle, and was frisked. The state's highest court adopted the automatic companion rule in finding that the frisk was constitutional. A Terry pat-down was more than counterbalanced by the need to protect both the officers and any innocent bystanders from harm. Adoption of the automatic companion rule provided needed bright line guidance to the bench, bar, law enforcement community, and citizens across the Commonwealth as to what was constitutionally permissible. The automatic companion rule was a limited and narrow exception to the exclusionary rule. It applied only when the driver had been lawfully arrested and the passengers had been lawfully expelled in preparation for a lawful search of the vehicle, and allowed an officer to conduct a brief pat-down for weapons (not a full-blown search) of the vehicle's passengers, regardless of whether those passengers' actions or appearance evidenced any independent indicia of dangerousness or suspicion.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that (1) the trial court did not err by allowing a dog handler to testify as to alerts by his dog to the presence of accelerants in the trailer, and the jury was able to weigh the testimony against a lab examiner who did not find accelerants in lab tests; (2) the testimony by fire investigators and other witnesses as well as defendant's statements after the fire were sufficient to support a conviction for arson under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 513.020; (3) although it was error under Ky. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of burglary and of being a persistent felony offender in the second degree. Defendant appealed, contending the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) erred in denying his motion to dismiss based on an 11 year delay, and in denying his motion to strike a challenged juror for cause. Defendant requested that the court overrule Morgan v. Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged juror's statement that he was &quot;absolutely&quot; pro-police and that he did not believe an officer would lie under oath clearly indicated that a defendant would have little or no chance of challenging an officer's testimony in that juror's mind. Given the reasonable evidence of bias, it was an abuse of discretion not to strike the juror. While a party could reasonably expect to be given all the rights granted to him by state law or rule, he had a certain right to a trial that was fair in its entirety. Ky. R. Crim. P. 9.36 made it mandatory for trial courts to excuse biased jurors for cause when a reasonable person would view the juror as biased. Not removing a biased juror from the venire, and thereby forcing a defendant to forfeit a peremptory strike, prevented defendant from getting the jury he had a right to choose. That violated a substantial right and could never have been harmless error. Finally, the pre-indictment delay was investigative delay, and thus, was not error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed on the peremptory strikes issue, and overruled Morgan v. Commonwealth. The pre-trial delay claim of error was affirmed. The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Boone Circuit Court (Kentucky), which convicted defendant on two counts of capital murder, two counts of attempted murder, one count of rape in the first degree, one count of burglary in the first degree, one count of robbery in the first degree, and one count of being a persistent offender in the second degree. The trial court sentenced defendant to death for the two murders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from the rape and stabbing of a woman and the stabbing of her three small children, two of whom were killed during the crimes. Defendant made an unusual plea agreement with the Commonwealth in which he agreed to plead guilty and volunteered for the death penalty. The trial court accepted the plea agreement and sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, defendant contended that the death penalty was unconstitutional and that he was incompetent to have voluntarily accepted the death penalty. The court reiterated its long-standing conclusion that the death penalty did not violate the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court further held that defendant's death sentence was not disproportionate, pursuant to the court's review as required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.075(3) considering the intentional killing of the two innocent children. The court also held that it was not necessary for defendant's indictment to have enumerated the aggravators against him nor did the trial court err by appointing defendant stand-by counsel after he requested and obtained withdrawal of his appointed counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases before the court from the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), plaintiffs, injured workers or the representative of a deceased worker, appealed respective trial court judgments granting summary judgment favor of defendant premises owners. The judgments established that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.690(1) immunized defendants from tort liability for the occupational diseases plaintiffs claimed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs asserted that they, or their decedent, contracted an occupational disease as a result of exposure to asbestos while performing work for defendants. In its judgments, the trial court found in favor of defendants, holding that they were contractors immune from tort liability, that the exclusive remedy provision was not unconstitutional, and that each owner had sufficiently proven that it had secured payment of compensation per Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;342.340. In one case, the court held that summary judgment in favor of the premises owner was improper because the available evidence inadequately supported the trial court's finding that plaintiffs performed work of a kind that was a regular or recurrent part of the work of that premises owner's business and because documented evidence established workers' compensation coverage. In the second case, the court found that the evidence did not support the trial court's conclusion that plaintiff in that case performed work of a kind that was a regular part of the work of the premises owners' businesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, the court affirmed the lower court insofar as that defendant was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law but reversed, in part, on the issue concerning proof of coverage. In the second case, the court reversed, in part, holding that certain defendants were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law and affirmed the proof of coverage and constitutionality issues. The court remanded both cases to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Kenton Circuit Court (Kentucky) that imposed the death penalty following his capital murder conviction, arguing that the circuit court erred in allowing him to stipulate to certain aggravating factors and that the introduction of a separate murder conviction should have been admissible at his penalty phase retrial because the conviction did not exist at the time of the original penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the U.S. Supreme Court's Apprendi and Blakely rulings did not preclude a defendant in the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial from stipulating to aggravating factors; both concerned the propriety of shifting penalty-enhancing factual determinations from the jury to the trial court, and neither prohibited a defendant from stipulating to penalty-enhancing facts. The evil sought to be eliminated by Apprendi and Blakely was nonconsensual judicial factfinding of penalty-enhancing factors, which infringed upon a defendant's right to have a jury find every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, and nothing in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.025 prevented a defendant from stipulating to the existence of aggravating circumstances. Further, the term &quot;prior,&quot; as used in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 532.025(1)(b) and 532.055(2)(a), referred to the status of defendant at the time of sentencing, not at the time of the commission of the charged crime. Thus, the Commonwealth could introduce a conviction that was obtained subsequent to the offense for which a defendant was being sentenced because, at the time of sentencing, it had become a &quot;prior&quot; conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The final judgment imposing the death penalty was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of the denial of his postconviction motions pursuant to Ky. R. Civ. P. 59.05 and Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42 entered by the Fayette Circuit Court (Kentucky) in a case where the inmate had been sentenced to death on two murder counts and to life imprisonment on a third murder count. Appellee Commonwealth made a motion to strike certain affidavits attached to the inmate's brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, the Commonwealth's motion to strike was denied because while the affidavits were executed after the Rule 11.42 hearing, the trial court had granted a motion to supplement the record. On the merits, the court rejected the inmate's argument of ineffective assistance of counsel on several bases. While the inmate claimed that his trial counsel failed to investigate properly, the court held that additional witnesses on the issues of extreme emotional disturbance (EED) and duress would have been cumulative as several witnesses had testified that the inmate had become depressed and begun heavy drug usage following his divorce and that the inmate had been changed by his friendship with and was possibly frightened by his co-defendant. Duress was not a defense to intentional murder under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 501.090, so it was reasonable trial strategy to present such evidence at the penalty stage instead of the guilt/innocence phase. A jury instruction that the Commonwealth was required to prove an absence of EED beyond a reasonable doubt was not required because the presence or absence of EED was a matter of evidence, not an element of the crime of murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the Commonwealth's motion to strike and affirmed the trial court's denial of postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, operating a motor vehicle on a learner's permit without a licensed operator, and being a persistent felony offender in the first degree. He was sentenced to eighteen years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the trial, defense counsel implied that defendant intended to offer perjured testimony. Defense counsel was then allowed to withdraw and leave the courtroom while defendant testified by way of a narrative statement, was cross-examined by the prosecution, and made his own closing statement. The appellate court ruled that defendant had waived his right to counsel when he proceeded against his attorney's advice, and that his attorney had acted properly in not assisting him to present false testimony. On appeal, the court found that defense counsel properly revealed his concern to the trial court pursuant to Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 3.130-1.6, 3.3. However, the trial court erred in permitting defense counsel to leave the courtroom and in advising appellant and counsel that counsel could leave the courtroom during the narrative testimony. By completely leaving the courtroom, in the presence of the jury, counsel telegraphed a problem to the jury, and defendant was unconstitutionally deprived of his right to assistance of counsel. This was compounded by requiring him to make his own closing argument and allowing counsel to return to conduct the sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the action to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police went to the arrestee's condominium complex to investigate a complaint. The arrestee alleged he approached an officer due to worries about his stepdaughter, and that the officer choked him, struck him with a flashlight, and excessively tightened his handcuffs. Based on this incident, the arrestee was charged with menacing, resisting arrest, and harassment; he was acquitted on all counts. Less than a year after his acquittal, he filed the instant suit. The trial court held the false imprisonment and excessive force claims were barred by &sect; 413.140(1)(a), (c) because the arrestee filed suit more than a year after his arrest. The high court held that as the favorable termination of criminal proceedings was not an element of false imprisonment, the limitations period began to run on the false imprisonment claim when the alleged false imprisonment ended, which occurred when the arrestee was arraigned on the charges. As he did not file suit within one year of his release from custody, his false imprisonment claim was time-barred. And as his excessive force claim accrued at the time of injury, but he filed suit more than one year after the arrest, that claim was also time-barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant worker sought to reopen her settled workers' compensation claim. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) reversed a decision by the workers' compensation board, and ruled that the finding of the administrative law judge (ALJ) on the issue of impairment was a sufficient basis to dismiss the reopening. The worker appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ALJ relied on a physician who testified that the 12 percent impairment rating which was the basis for the initial settlement had not changed, and that the only change at reopening was in the worker's subjective complaints of pain. The appellate court ruled that, because Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.125(1)(d) required only a &quot;worsening of impairment,&quot; the worker was not required to prove a greater permanent impairment rating in order to receive permanent total disability benefits at reopening. Her burden was to prove by objective medical evidence that she sustained a worsening of impairment from the injury, to prove that the change was permanent, and to prove that it caused her to be totally and permanently disabled under the standard described in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.0011(11)(c). The worker was entitled to receive the difference between the actual disability the injury caused at settlement and the disability that it caused at reopening. Because it was not entirely clear that the ALJ applied the correct standard when determining whether the worker experienced a worsening of impairment, the claim needed to be remanded for further consideration.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 67.083(3)(z); (2) the ordinance was content neutral as the government's interest in preventing negative secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses was unrelated to the suppression of expression; (3) the ordinance furthered the county's substantial governmental interest in preventing and combating the negative secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses; and (4) the requirements of the ordinance were only a minimal restriction in furtherance of the asserted government interests. Moreover, defendant did not present sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the fiscal court's rationale or findings, and thus shift the evidentiary burden back to the fiscal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the Court of Appeals was reversed insofar as it remanded the case to the district court for further evidentiary hearings and required the fiscal court to proffer supplementary evidence in support of the ordinance. The prior holding of the district court regarding the constitutionality of the ordinance was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence seized during a warrantless raid of defendant's medical clinic should have been excluded as violative of the Fourth Amendment and Ky. Const. &sect; 10 where criminal law enforcement investigators had supplied the information upon which the raid was based and had determined which files were to be seized by the medical board. Moreover, a short delay in obtaining a warrant would not have frustrated the governmental authorities involved in the case. However, the statement made by defendant to two agents did not need to be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree where the statements were made voluntarily and without any intimidation or coercion and defendant was not seized or detained at the time he was questioned. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.202(6)(a) and (b) were facially constitutional as the examination of the Kentucky All-Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting System reports did not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment or Ky. Const. &sect; 10. The convictions did not offend double jeopardy principles where each prescription for a controlled substance was a specific period of conduct constituting a separate offense under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 218A.1404(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was vacated. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred by denying the motion to suppress evidence obtained in two searches conducted at the respective homes of defendant's mother and sister. The appellate court held that the trial court's factual finding that defendant's mother consented to the entry of her home was conclusive, as it was supported by substantial evidence. The appellate court also concluded that the parole officers had the authority to arrest defendant. The search of defendant's sister house was not erroneous either, but was justified by the plain language of the conditions of defendant's release on parole. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements made to police interrogators following defendant's arrest. The appellate court disagreed, concluding that the trial court properly exercised its discretion to judge the credibility of witnesses and to draw inferences from their testimony. The trial court accepted the testimony of several police officers that defendant did not invoke his rights before making statements and rejected defendant's testimony to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death, the present court remanded the case for a new penalty phase where defendant would be eligible for an instruction on life without parole. On remand, a different jury in the Kenton Circuit Court (Kentucky) recommended a death sentence, and the trial court again sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that the trial court did not err in determining that aggravating circumstances had been found by the first jury and that defendant had stipulated to the existence of the aggravating circumstances. An aggravating circumstance could be found in either the guilt or the penalty phase, and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.025 did not prevent a defendant from stipulating to the existence of aggravating circumstances. Next, the sentence of life without parole defendant had received for an earlier murder did not estop the Commonwealth from seeking the death penalty in the present case. Even if the doctrine applied, defendant had not shown the elements necessary to establish estoppel. A prosecutor's asking a defense witness if she had e-mailed defendant or had checked his web site was not an improper comment on the amenities in prison. The prosecutor's use of the term &quot;evil&quot; and the phrase &quot;a leopard cannot change its spots&quot; in closing was not improper, given defense counsel's comment that defendant was traveling &quot;the road to redemption.&quot; Defendant had already been found guilty. Finally, the court had previously held that lethal injection was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the jury in regard to the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a husband and wife, challenged a judgment which determined that a dirt road was a public road and awarded punitive damages to the primary appellees, neighbors, based on appellants' acts in denying road access to the neighbors. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) remanded the case for further consideration of the punitive damages award and otherwise affirmed. The state supreme court granted appellants' motion for discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disputed unpaved dirt road formed a border between the parties' properties. Although the neighbors' property was not landlocked, the disputed road provided the best access to the northern section of their farm. Eventually, the parties became embroiled in a dispute over access to the road. Appellants erected fenceposts at the entrance to the road, completely blocking access. The jury found that the disputed road was in fact a county road and awarded punitive damages of $ 5,000 to the neighbors, presumably for appellants' intimidating, abusive behavior and for blocking access to the road. The state supreme court held that the neighbors' claim was valid and amounted to a private action for a public nuisance. The neighbors alleged that the disputed dirt road was actually a public turnpike that was owned by the county and that appellants' efforts to prevent their access to the road amounted to an interference with a public right. While appellants' conduct was not so reprehensible as to support unlimited punitive damages, the appellate court could not say that the award of $ 5,000 was so out of step with the degree of reprehensibility as to be unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision by the appellate court to remand the case to the trial court for further consideration of the punitive damages award was reversed. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ky. R. Civ. P. 60.02, appellant mother filed a motion to set aside a judgment of adoption in favor of appellee paternal grandparents, the adoptive parents of her two minor children. The Floyd Circuit Court, Family Court Division (Kentucky), denied the motion on grounds it was untimely under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 199.540(2); the Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children were raised primarily by their grandparents, without any objection by the mother. Two and one-half years after the adoption judgment was entered, she filed the instant action, alleging she never signed a consent to adoption and was never served with a copy of the adoption petition. She had signed a &quot;consent to custody&quot; form that did not mention adoption and did not include the information required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 199.011(14) to be included in adoption consent forms. The appellate court held that as she failed to challenge the adoption within a year after entry of the judgment, her challenge based on the failure to comply with the statutory adoption procedures was barred by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 199.540(2)'s one-year limitation period. But if, as she alleged, she had lacked adequate notice of adoption proceedings, strict application of &sect; 199.540(2) might violate her Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. Due to the state of the record, remand was required to determine whether she had sufficient notice of the adoption proceedings. If she had received notice of the proceedings but failed to appear or raise any objection, then she waived any due process claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for additional factfinding.</SPAN></P>

The result of the alleged failure was that the governor issued an executive order giving state employees a 2.7 percent annual raise despite the fact that they were entitled to at least a five percent annual increment pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A.355. The trial court found that the General Assembly could retroactively suspend Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A.355. On appeal, the state supreme court found that the governor did not have the power to suspend statutes but that the General Assembly had such a power. Moreover, the state supreme court found that the General Assembly could retroactively suspend statutes, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 446.080(3), if the legislature clearly manifested its intent to do so and the evidence showed that the General Assembly had intended such a result by the language it used in bills that it passed regarding the budget.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate exhausted his state court appeals, and his federal habeas petition, which alleged he could not be executed because he was mentally retarded, was unsuccessful. The trial court found that he failed to present evidence sufficient for it to determine the scientific validity of &quot;mental age.&quot; On appeal, he argued that under the rationale of Roper v. Simmons, which was decided after his trial, the execution of offenders whose mental age was below 18 violated the Eight Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The high court disagreed. Roper prohibited the execution of only those offenders whose chronological age was below 18 at the time of the commission of the offense. Moreover, a decision recognizing a new constitutional right would not be retroactively applied if a statute in effect at the time of trial afforded the same right. As Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 640.040 barred the execution of offenders under 16, Roper created no greater protection than &sect; 640.040, and the inmate's claim, even if viable, was procedurally defaulted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.277 and a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), a workers' compensation claim was submitted for alternative dispute resolution (ADR), appellee arbitrator determined after a hearing that appellant claimant's request for arbitration was untimely under the CBA. Appellee Kentucky Workers' Compensation Board and the Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed. The claimant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant hurt her back at work; her claim was referred to mediation under the ADR agreement. She told the mediator she rejected appellant employer's settlement offer and needed to talk to her attorney. About 14 months later, her attorney demanded arbitration. The arbitrator dismissed her claim for permanent income benefits, finding the request for arbitration - which, under the ADR agreement, had to be filed within 30 days after the mediation concluded -- was unreasonably late. The claimant argued that the ADR agreement violated Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.277(3) by diminishing her rights, and denied her procedural due process and the same rights to income benefits and notice as provided in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 342. The high court disagreed. She was aware of the ADR program and had ample time to obtain advice from counsel as to her rights. As she continued in her job after her union agreed to the ADR provision, she was deemed to have consented to it and was properly charged with knowledge of its terms. Though the delay in requesting arbitration did not affect the employer's ability to defend, permitting a such a delay would have increased its interest costs on unpaid benefits.</SPAN></P>

Crim. P. 11.42. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) denied the motions in each case and overruled motions to reconsider its orders. Appellants filed appeals against appellee Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the court addressed the appeals in a single opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first appellant had been appointed an attorney to assist him with his appeal from his motion. The attorney mailed the notice of appeal to the wrong court. The court stated that when incompetence of state-appointed counsel cost an indigent defendant a right of appeal under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22A.020(1), that defendant ought to be entitled to a belated appeal. Thus, the court rejected the dictum in Merrick v. Commonwealth, 132 S.W.3d 220, 221 (Ky. App. 2004), that suggested that a reinstated or belated appeal was never available except in a direct first appeal of a judgment of conviction. The second appellant, however, was not represented by counsel when he filed his late appeal, and his motion for a belated appeal was properly denied. The second appellant also argued that the notice of the entry of the order denying relief under Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42 had been served upon him incorrectly and thus the time for appeal would not start to run until it was corrected. The court rejected this argument. There was an entry as required by Ky. R. Crim. P. 12.06(2), and the second appellant did not deny that he had been served with proper notice of the date the judgment was entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's decision as to the first appellant and remanded the case with instructions for the lower court to grant his motion for belated appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Hopkins Circuit Court (Kentucky) for manufacturing methamphetamine and being a persistent felony offender in the second degree. Defendant argued that since he did not possess all the chemicals necessary to manufacture methamphetamine, his conviction had to be reversed pursuant to Kotila.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A store manager recognized defendant as having bought two boxes of Sudafed three weeks earlier and called the police. Defendant's trunk was subsequently found to contain 396 cold and allergy pills containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, a gallon of Liquid Fire, and three cans of Pyro. The appellate court held that Kotila's construction of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.1432(1)(b) was incorrect. The language in &sect; 218A.1432(1)(b) that stated &quot;the chemicals or equipment for the manufacture of methamphetamine&quot; meant that one had to possess two or more chemicals or items of equipment with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine to fall within the statute.&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.1432(1)(b) was not unconstitutionally vague. The manager's testimony showed defendant's intent to manufacture methamphetamine; thus, it was admissible. While the prosecutor technically misstated the law, regarding the intent element, since the trial court correctly instructed the jury, the error did not rise to flagrant misconduct.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The juror was ultimately removed from the panel by a peremptory challenge by the defense. A review of all of the answers given by the prospective juror during voir dire indicated her willingness to consider a minimum sentence. The juror was questioned by both prosecution and defense and in response to questions by defense counsel indicated that she would have to listen to the evidence in the case. She stated that she could consider a term of years depending on the facts of the case. A subsequent request for removal of the juror by the defense was denied by the trial court. An analysis of the answers given by the juror during voir dire indicated that there was sufficient basis for her to express her willingness not to automatically vote for the death penalty and to consider the full range of penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an employee of an independent contractor, sued appellee owner of an industrial plant, seeking damages arising from appellant's fall at the plant. A jury returned a verdict finding both parties at fault and fixing the injured person's damages at $ 44,971. The trial court reduced the judgment to a lump sum of $ 33,728. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) reversed and vacated the judgment. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner had contracted with appellant's employer to buy a system which required installation of a large tank at the plant. While working on the project, appellant fell and was injured. Appellant alleged that the owner was negligent in various ways. The intermediate appellate court held that an owner was not liable for injuries to third parties arising out of work performed by an independent contractor unless the work was a nuisance or is inherently dangerous, and that the work at issue fell into neither of those categories. The intermediate appellate court also held that, in any event, the owner's liability was limited to payment of workers' compensation benefits. The appellate court found that the cases relied on to vacate the judgment were inapplicable since they addressed an owner's vicarious liability for injuries caused by the contractor's negligence. The trial court properly held the owner liable because of the owner's own negligence. Finally, the language in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.700(1) clearly precluded double recovery by appellant and did not condition that preclusion upon whether his employer actually pursued its subrogation right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was reversed insofar as it vacated appellant's judgment in its entirety, and the case was remanded to the trial court with directions to determine an appropriate computation of the total credit due to the owner in light of the employer's/insurer's failure to assert its right of subrogation and enter an amended judgment in accordance with that computation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss firearm charges based on the purported unconstitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 527.040 and his motion to suppress evidences. After entering conditional guilty pleas to trafficking in marijuana, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia, he appealed. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed; defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Attempting to serve an arrest warrant on another person, police went to defendant's home. While talking to him on the porch, they saw shotgun shells and packets of marijuana inside the home and smelled an odor of marijuana. The police entered the home through the open door, arrested him for possession of a controlled substance, and seized the marijuana and shotgun shells. They searched the home and found a gun, electronic scales, and codeine cough syrup. The high court held that as exigent circumstances justified entry into the home in order to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence, defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated. That possession of marijuana (Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 218A.1422) was a misdemeanor was immaterial as defendant faced up to one year's imprisonment if convicted. He argued that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 527.040, which prohibited convicted felons from possessing guns, violated the right to bear arms guaranteed by Ky. Const. &sect; 1(7). The high court disagreed. The right to bear arms set forth in Ky. Const. &sect; 1(7) was not absolute. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 527.040 was not arbitrary or irrational and did not unduly infringe upon the people's right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) granted summary judgment in favor of appellee candidate, and against appellants, the candidate's opponent and the president of the state senate, holding that the opponent was not qualified to hold the office of state senator for the 37th District. The court also denied the candidate's request for an injunction. The opponent and president appealed, while the candidate cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gravamen of the arguments posed by both the opponent and the resident was that Ky. Const. &sect; 2 did not permit the judiciary to review the General Assembly's exercise of power pursuant to Ky. Const. &sect; 38 and, therefore, the Franklin Circuit Court erred in holding that the senate acted arbitrarily in seating the candidate as state senator. But, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;118.176 clearly permitted a circuit court to consider and adjudicate challenges to a candidate's bona fides commenced prior to the general election. Also, there were no limitations placed on how far in advance of the election the action had to be commenced, nor were there limitations placed on the circuit court concerning the time for adjudication. Further, the Jefferson Circuit Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the candidate's motion and grant her relief, and that jurisdiction continued after the election occurred. Finally, the circuit court did not err in declining to compel the president to seat the candidate as the senator for the 37th District, and, the fact that her opponent was disqualified did not grant her a right to the office. Rather, the effect was that no election occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although a portion of the judgment was reversed, that portion declaring that the opponent was not constitutionally qualified for the office of State Senator and could not be seated was affirmed, as was that part of the judgment denying the candidate's request to compel the Senate to seat her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate appellate court held that prejudgment and bias by two Fiscal Court members operated to deprive the corporation of procedural due process. The appellate court disagreed. In the administrative or legislative context, the concept of impartiality was, by necessity and by function, more relaxed and informal. Zoning determinations were only subject to judiciary review for the limited purpose of considering whether such determinations were arbitrary. Under the circumstances of this case, the corporation's right to receive fair and nonarbitrary treatment before the Fiscal Court was adequately protected by adhering to the traditional standards. There were no allegations of malice, fraud, corruption, or other conflicts of interest on the part of the Fiscal Court members. Moreover, despite the members' preexisting opinions regarding the community effects of subsurface mining in general, nothing in the record indicated that these members did not seriously or honestly consider the corporation's proposal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's work-related injury occurred when she was 68 years old and eligible for Social Security retirement benefits. An administrative law judge determined that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.730(4) (1996) limited the duration of the employee's partial disability award to 27.57 weeks. The employee asserted that she was entitled to receive 425 weeks of partial disability benefits. She argued that because the purpose of partial disability benefits was to compensate her for having received a permanent injury, the General Assembly had no rational basis for treating her differently based on her age. The state supreme court found that the employee's argument was based on the erroneous premise that benefits awarded for total and partial disability had different purposes. The employee failed to show that &sect; 342.730(4) had no conceivable rational basis. Consequently, because the constitutionality of the statute had been previously upheld, the employee's equal protection arguments under the Fourteenth Amendment and Ky. Const. &sect; 3 failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Barren Circuit Court (Kentucky), which convicted defendant of capital murder and kidnapping, kidnapping, first-degree criminal trespass, second-degree assault, and violation of a protective order. Defendant was sentenced to life without the benefit of parole for the capital charges, 20 years for the kidnapping, 12 months for the trespass charge, and other terms for the other offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from shooting his ex-girlfriend, shooting a male companion of the ex-girlfriend, and defendant holding an innocent homeowner hostage in a three hour standoff with police. After shooting his ex-girlfriend, defendant took her to his car and drove away with her legs dragging from the rear passenger door. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to have supported the jury's determination that the ex-girlfriend was murdered during the course of a kidnapping since she had died when shot. The court noted that the jury implicitly determined that the ex-girlfriend was alive at the time defendant took her from her vehicle because one can kidnap only a living person. Further, the testimony of an expert physician was that the ex-girlfriend would not have died instantly, which provided enough evidence upon which the jury could have based its conclusion. The court found no merit in defendant attempting to launch a collateral attack on the validity of the emergency protective order that had been granted to the ex-girlfriend previously and no abuse of discretion was found for denying defendant's change of venue request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Grayson Circuit Court, Kentucky, after a jury trial, convicted two defendants of manufacturing methamphetamine, that was firearm enhanced, and possession of anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container with intent to manufacture methamphetamine. One defendant was also convicted of possession of drug paraphernalia, subsequent offense, and receiving stole property. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispositive issue was if the trial court committed reversible error when it denied defendants their right to ascertain during voir dire if any prospective juror would be prejudiced against them if they exercised their Fifth Amendment rights not to testify in their own defense. Each defendant exercised that Fifth Amendment right. The trial court opened juror voir dire with a series of questions. The State's prosecutor followed. Defendants' counsel followed the prosecutor. The trial court prohibited counsel from asking certain questions because it said its &quot;no adverse inference&quot; jury instructions would cure any prejudice. Counsel's questions were whether a juror understood defendants did not have to testify in their own behalf and whether a juror would hold that against defendants. Counsel's specificity helped to preserve the error for appellate review. The trial court was required to allow counsel to ask the jurors those and followup questions during voir dire and to discharge for cause a juror who indicated that he would be prejudiced by defendants not testifying. The trial court's proposed instructions could not cure that type of juror prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court reversed more culpable defendant's convictions and sentences and remanded those charges for a new trial. The appeals court vacated the less culpable defendant's methamphetamine manufacturing, intent to manufacture, and receiving stolen property convictions and sentences. The appeals court reversed the less culpable defendant's convictions and sentences for paraphernalia and remanded that charge for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A district court jury convicted defendant of operating a motor vehicle with alcohol concentration of or above 0.08, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 189A.010(1)(a). A circuit court reversed. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) denied discretionary review. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court held that it was error to introduce a videotape of defendant's field sobriety test. Defendant sought review of the circuit court's decision with regards to a jury instruction. However, the Commonwealth did not file a cross motion with respect to the reversal or for discretionary review. Thus, the circuit court's reversal for a new trial because of the admission of the sobriety test was not an issue before the appellate court. The case was thus to be retried. The only issue was how to instruct the jury on retrial. The elements of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 189A.010(1)(a) were having a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more and operating or being in control of a vehicle. These two elements needed to coincide. The trial court's instruction required the jury to find that defendant had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time he was operating or in physical control of a motor vehicle. This instruction was proper, and the prosecutor should not have been allowed to tell the jury that defendant's blood alcohol concentration did not have to be 0.08 or more when he was operating his motor vehicle if it was at that level when the test was given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court was reversed and the appellate court held that the district court properly instructed the jury but erroneously failed to sustain the objections to the prosecutor's opening statement and closing argument.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape by the Jessamine Circuit Court (Kentucky). Defendant asserted that the trial court erred when it informed him he had no right to hybrid representation, held an inadequate hearing on his request for substitute counsel, admitted evidence regarding his refusal to voluntarily provide biological specimens, and refused to instruct the jury on sexual misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim accused defendant of having non-consensual sex with her while she was intoxicated. Defendant refused to give a DNA sample when initially asked by the police. A search warrant was obtained and his DNA matched that found on the victim. On the first day of trial, prior to the jury being selected, defendant requested that he be allowed to act as co-counsel was denied. The appellate court held that the trial court erred in denying that request. Defendant informed the judge of his dissatisfaction with his appointed attorney after motions in limine had been heard. His request was timely and unequivocal considering the circumstances under which the request was made. However, the trial court followed the correct procedure for addressing defendant's concerns with his representation. Thus, there was no error in the denial of substitute counsel. The admission of defendant's refusal to provide specimens was a violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment and Ky. Const. &sect; 10 as he had not been arrested. Because the victim was of majority age and defendant was of majority age, the refusal to instruct the jury on sexual misconduct was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured sued defendant insurer alleging a violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;304.12-230, the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (UCSPA). A jury awarded the insured $ 30,000.00 in compensatory damages and $ 1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. The trial court entered judgment accordingly and also awarded the insured attorney fees and costs. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was injured in a car accident. The insurer made basic reparations benefits payments directly to the insured's medical providers, exhausting the limits on the insured's policy. The insurance company of the party at fault paid the insured the limits of that person's policy. When the insured demanded payment from the insurer of the underinsured motorists (UIM) coverage limits, the insurer only offered the insured a portion of that limit, deducting the sum of the money it had already paid and that received from the other insurance company. The issue before supreme court was whether the trial court erred in admitting &quot;bad acts&quot; evidence in violation of Ky. R. Evid. 404(b). The insurer's motion in limine to exclude the evidence at issue, the testimony of a party who had previously made a claim against the insurer, was overruled. The supreme court concluded that the testimony was erroneously admitted because the other action was not similar to the instant action. Among other things, the insurer was the liability insurer of the tort defendant in that action, rather than the UIM insurer. In addition, the court noted that the same adjuster was not involved in both cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the Court of Appeals was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The state environmental cabinet appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mining company permittee held a surface mining permit. An individual began to build a house in the area covered by it. The state environmental cabinet noted a &quot;third-party disturbance&quot; on the site and ordered the mining company permittee to submit a permit revision explaining how the land use would be affected. The mining company permittee did not do so. It was then ordered to submit a revision by a certain date. It did not do so. The state environmental cabinet then issued a cessation order and, based on it, issued a &quot;Notice of Proposed Assessment&quot; for the mining company's violation of the state environmental cabinet's orders. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 350.0301(5) and 405 Ky. Admin. Regs. 7:092, &sect; 6 provided that corporations, such as the mining company permittee, could challenge the monetary assessment, but only if it prepaid the proposed assessment. Another regulation provided that an individual did not have to prepay the assessment in order to challenge it. The state environmental cabinet and the trial court both ruled against the mining company permittee. The appellate court reversed. On appeal, the state supreme court found the statute and regulation were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

P. 76.36, to challenge the personnel action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a former county pretrial services officer. The employer was the Kentucky Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC). Initially, the employee filed his petition for appeal in a circuit court. The circuit court found that, because the employer was the administrative arm of the Supreme Court of Kentucky, requests for review of its actions could only have been brought before that court. The court held that the AOC was removed from legislative authority. However, the policy was not to contest the propriety of legislation in the area of governance of the AOC to which the court could have acceded through a wholesome comity. Pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13B.140, a party wishing to appeal an AOC personnel action was allowed to file such appeal in either the Franklin Circuit Court or the circuit court of the county in which that party resided or operated a place of business. In reviewing the AOC's action, the circuit court was confined to the record unless there was fraud or misconduct, was not to substitute its judgment for that of the AOC as to the weight of the evidence on fact questions, and was limited to affirming the order or reversing it and remanding the action.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was also convicted of assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified that she met defendant in a bar, and she went with him to another bar, where they drank more alcohol and smoked some pot. Defendant beat the victim savagely and repeatedly, and he left her naked on the side of a road. She suffered multiple fractures and other serious injuries. On the morning of the first trial, one charge was dismissed by the Commonwealth. A mistrial resulted due to a hung jury. At the retrial, defendant was tried on the former charges as well as on a new charge for wanton endangerment. Defendant was convicted and sentenced. On appeal, the Court of Appeals remanded the matter for the Commonwealth to rebut the &quot;presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness&quot; associated with the late filing of the endangerment charge. On further review, the court found that the Court of Appeals erred. The court held that it would not extend the presumption of &quot;prosecutorial vindictiveness,&quot; as enunciated in Pearce and Perry, to the pretrial setting. Accordingly, the fact of the mistrial and the addition of the endangerment charge did not lead to that presumption, and it was deemed appropriate in the circumstances. Defendant failed to prove actual vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient had gone to the hospital to have blood drawn upon her doctor's order. The phlebotomist employed by the hospital placed a tourniquet on the patient's arm and left her without supervision for approximately 10 minutes. When the phlebotomist returned from answering a telephone call in another room, the patient's arm was swollen and had changed colors. The patient, who was 80 years old, experienced medical complications with her arm and sought treatment. After medical consultation, three physicians concluded that the patient was experiencing nerve problems with her right arm and specifically related her condition to the tourniquet incident. The hospital contended on appeal that at the time it moved for summary judgment, the patient had not named an expert to testify as to the standard of care of a phlebotomist and that it should have been granted summary judgment instead of the trial court permitting a continuance to allow the patient to identify such an expert. The court held that there was no abuse of the trial court discretion in continuing the case to allow the patient to identify an expert.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an employee of a fluid capture system seller, sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which vacated a jury award of damages to the employee in his negligence action against appellee fluid capture system purchaser, arising from a slip and fall that the employee had while on the purchaser's premises. The jury had found both parties at fault. The purchaser filed a cross-appeal from the Court of Appeals' judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fluid capture system purchaser contracted with the seller for the purchase and installation of a system in the purchaser's industrial plant. There was a large amount of oil and grease on the motor room floor, and the employee of the seller slipped and fell through a hole to the floor below, resulting in serious injury. The employee filed a workers' compensation (WC) claim against his employer, the seller, and he received benefits. He also filed a negligence action against the purchaser. The trial court instructed the jury that the purchaser had a duty to exercise ordinary care to maintain its business in a reasonably safe condition, rather than with the employee's requested negligence per se instruction. The jury found both parties at fault and awarded damages to the employee. The Court of Appeals vacated the jury verdict, finding that recovery under the WC claim precluded any further award. On further review, the court held that under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;342.700(1), those parts of the award for which recovery was already had in the WC proceedings were to be vacated.
