</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed the Superior Court of King County (Washington) erred in allowing an officer to testify beyond reading a report because of a lack of memory. He also challenged a sentencing enhancement under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435 for delivering drugs within 1000 feet of a school bus stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with delivery of cocaine with a school bus stop enhancement under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435. He left the area but was arrested on a bench warrant. Trial began nearly five years after the arrest and officers had difficulties remembering details. Appellant claimed that an officer's report should only have been read into evidence as a recorded recollection. This claim was not raised in the trial court. It was unclear what prejudice appellant suffered. Additionally, had he simply made an objection, the trial court could have cured the prejudice by allowing the report to be read into evidence. Appellant also claimed Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435 was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of his case. Information about the location of the school bus stop was available by objective means; thus the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Appellant failed to object to officer's testimony, he did not show prejudice, and any potential error could have been cured with an objection. School bus stop enhancement was not unconstitutional: there were readily understandable and available means to find location of bus stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed that the definition of &quot;motel&quot; in Grays Harbor County, Wash., Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance No. 38a was unconstitutionally vague.

It did not provide adequate standards to prevent arbitrary or discretionary enforcement. Respondent's officials were forced to rely on their discretion to determine if there was a violation. Appellant was entitled to injunctive relief against the enforcement of the ordinance. Thus, the fines previously collected were refunded and those previously imposed but not collected were dismissed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review in the King County Superior Court (Washington) of an order issued by respondent Southwest Air Pollution Control Authority and affirmed by respondent Pollution Control Hearings Board (PCHB). The order directed a power plant owned by respondent owners to reduce its emissions of four pollutants. Respondent PCHB certified the decision for direct appellate review, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.05.518(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Southwest Air Pollution Control Authority (SWAPCA) directed a power plant to reduce its emissions of four pollutants, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Respondent SWAPCA issued the order pursuant to the state's Clean Air Act, which requires all existing sources of air pollutants in the state to control their emissions by using reasonably available control technology (RACT). Appellant argued that respondent SWAPCA did not conduct its RACT review properly, resulting in emission levels that were too high and control technologies that did not adequately protect human health. In affirming respondent Pollution Control Hearings Board's decision rejecting appellant's claims, the appellate court held that appellant did not meet his burden in challenging respondent PCHB's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Respondent PCHB did not erroneously interpret the state's Clean Air Act as applied to the requirements for setting RACT. Substantial evidence supported respondent PCHB's findings that addressed the scientific underpinnings of the emissions limits and the cost effectiveness and impact of various control technologies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed. Respondent pollution control agency's decision to affirm respondent local agency's order directing a power plant to reduce emissions of four pollutants was not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with second-degree assault for pointing a rifle at a police officer. The trial court found that appellant was suffering from diminished capacity and that he could not form the specific intent required for assault. However, it held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.270, unlawful display of a firearm, was a lesser-included offense and convicted him of that crime. It also assessed appellant costs for the expert witness who testified for the defense on diminished capacity. The facts, coupled with evidence of appellant's diminished capacity, supported an inference that he committed the offense of unlawful display of a firearm. Appellant was convicted of a lesser-included offense that was related both procedurally and substantively to the charged offense. The superior court properly assessed him under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.01.160(1) for costs related to the greater offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the insured's former spouse, appealed a judgment of the Yakima County Superior Court (Washington), which granted summary judgment awarding life insurance proceeds to respondents, the insured's children, rather than appellant, who was named as the primary beneficiary in the policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that: (1) oral evidence was admissible to prove the insured's intent to maintain appellant as primary beneficiary after the divorce; (2) Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 11.07.010 was unconstitutional when applied to insurance contracts made prior to the statute's enactment; and (3) Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 11.07.010(2)(b)(ii) rendered the automatic revocation provision inapplicable. In affirming trial court's judgment, the court noted that appellant had standing to assert insured's impairment of contract claim. The court concluded that the statute automatically revoked the beneficiary designation naming appellant. Operation of the statute did not unconstitutionally impair insured's contract with respondent insurer. The statute served a legitimate public purpose by applying will revocation principles to nonprobate assets and requiring that these assets be considered in the event of the dissolution or invalidation of a marriage. Appellant could not recover the policy proceeds because she was no longer a beneficiary under the policy. Any redesignation of appellant as a beneficiary had to be in writing. The court denied respondent children's request for an award of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Statute automatically revoked beneficiary designation naming insured's former spouse as primary beneficiary in life insurance policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to solicitation to deliver cocaine. Appellant claimed that when he disputed the constitutional validity of a prior conviction, the trial court was required to hold a real facts hearing pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.370(2). The proper remedy for appellant to challenge the prior conviction on the grounds that his plea form did not advise him of his right to remain silent would have been to pursue a personal restraint petition. Appellant's collateral attack on his prior conviction was properly rejected.

Appellants could not obtain joint uses of private ways of necessity that would expand the uses of appellees neighboring property owners, nor could they obtain full access to their property by use of the easements held by appellees neighboring property owners.

The search of defendant's car was unconstitutional under Wash. Const. I, &sect; 7, and defendant's suppression motion should have been granted. Any evidence seized as a result of that illegality should have been suppressed, including evidence later seized at the police station. But for the cocaine illegally seized from the car, defendant would not have been arrested and subsequently strip-searched; therefore, the cocaine obtained from the strip-search should have been suppressed also. Without the cocaine, no evidence existed supporting the possession charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed. Search of defendant's car was unconstitutional, and defendant's suppression motion should have been granted. Any evidence seized as a result of that illegality should have been suppressed, including evidence later seized at the police station.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged convictions entered in the Superior Court of Benton County (Washington), claiming Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fled the scene of an accident in which the other driver was injured. Appellant claimed the felony hit and run statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.52.020, was unconstitutionally vague. The victim's cut unambiguously qualified as an injury. Trial court did not err in rejecting instruction on lesser-included offense of misdemeanor hit and run. Trial court's statements made no comment on the evidence or on the merits of the case. Evidence was sufficient for jury to find that appellant drove the car under the influence of alcohol and left the scene without offering assistance. Appellant did not meet the newly discovered evidence threshold showing, and his claim that a police officer had an earlier police report with an exculpatory statement was unsupported by the record. Offender score was not incorrectly computed. Ineffective assistance of counsel and conspiracy claims both failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Victim's cut qualified as an injury; thus hit and run statute was not unconstitutional as applied to appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner ordinance violators were charged in separate cases with violating Spokane, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 10.11.010 involving domestic violence assault. The municipal court convicted each of them. The superior court then affirmed the convictions. Petitioners appealed. They argued the ordinance was unconstitutional, as it required a willful act and the state statute on assault required an intentional mental state. Petitioners also challenged the trial court's jury instruction regarding the definition of assault and whether the evidence supported reasonable apprehension and imminent fear of bodily injury instructions. The court affirmed. The court held respondent city's ordinance was constitutional because the laws did not conflict in the sense that they could not coexist. The court also held there was no indication the legislature meant for the state statute to preempt the ordinance. The court further held the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on assault, and the evidence supported the other instructions given. Finally, the court held no other reversible error occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgments affirmed. The municipal assault ordinance was constitutional even though it used the less serious form of mental culpability &quot;willful&quot; rather than the state assault statute's &quot;intent,&quot; as the laws did not conflict, trial court did not err in instructing the jury on assault definition, evidence supported instructing jury on reasonable apprehension and imminent fear of bodily injury, and no other reversible error occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dissolution action, the trial court awarded the parties' preembryos to respondent, who wanted to place the preembryos with an out-of-state couple, rather than to appellant, who wanted the preembryos awarded to her for implanting in a surrogate, with the intent that appellant would be the primary residential parent for any resulting child. On appeal, appellant argued the trial court erred in applying a best-interests-of-the-child standard to the preembryos, and should have enforced the egg donor contract, which, according to appellant, compelled an award of the preembryos to her. The court affirmed the judgment, determining that although the trial court erred in considering only the best interests of any child resulting from the preembryos, respondent was not bound by contract to become a parent. The court reasoned that because respondent was the only progenitor before the court, he had the right to control the destiny of the preembryos. Accordingly, the court held that under the circumstances, respondent could exercise his right not to procreate in a limited way that allowed the preembryos to develop but avoided placing him in the unwanted parenting role.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the contracts signed by the parties did not require, either by express or implied terms, that respondent continue with the parties' family plan after the dissolution. Further, respondent's right not to procreate compelled an award of the preembryos to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington), refusing to declare a mistrial in his trial, in which he was convicted of third degree assault and unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of third degree assault and unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. The trial court ordered that officers could not have testified about a prior drug incident involving appellant, but allowed officers to testify that they had observed suspicious activity prior to this time involving the appellant. In response to the prosecutor's question as to why the police were suspicious of appellant's actions, one officer responded that he had seen him on two past occasions where there was an arrest for narcotic related activity. Appellant moved for a mistrial, which was denied. The court affirmed the denial, reasoning that even though the testimony violated the court's order, the violation was inadvertent. The reference to &quot;prior contacts&quot; was of minor relevance in the context of the entire case, especially because the direct evidence on the charged crimes was overwhelming. Further the testimony minimized the inadvertent remark by clarifying that appellant was not arrested in the prior incidents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city required a preemployment urinalysis drug test for about half its positions. Taxpayers-appellants challenged the constitutionality of this program, though none claimed to have applied to respondent for employment. They cited both the U.S. Const. amend. IV and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Both sides sought summary judgment. Respondent's motion was granted and the case dismissed. The court reversed, holding that drug testing constituted a warrantless search without particularized grounds for suspicion, and respondent had not met its burden of showing the program was narrowly drawn to achieve a compelling governmental interest. The state constitution was more protective of personal privacy than the federal constitution, and respondent's testing program violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Public safety was a compelling governmental interest but the testing program was applied too broadly to positions not implicating public safety issues, such as librarians and accountants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In connection with shopping center construction, respondent sought a site development permit to clear, grade, and remove approximately 26,000 cubic yards of material from a 1.4 acre parcel of land adjacent to residential communities built on a larger parcel that a previous owner had used to mine gravel. Although the 1.4 acre parcel and the larger mined parcel were originally contiguous, they were severed by the relocation of a road. The court reversed the hearing examiner's decision reversing appellant's denial of respondent's application, holding that the nonconforming use was abandoned. The elements of abandonment of a nonconforming mining use were met, as the 1.4 acre parcel was: (1) never mined; (2) geographically isolated from mining operations; (3) not included in any required mining application, permit, or reclamation plan; (4) ignored as a potential mining source for 17 years; and (5) offered for sale for residential and commercial development with no mention of mining uses. Because respondent and his predecessor abandoned any claimed right to continue a preexisting nonconforming mining use on the 1.4 acre parcel, appellant properly denied respondent's application.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed suit, seeking an injunction and back pay. The trial court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment and dismissed appellant's complaint.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon motion by respondent mother, the trial court modified, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 26.09.191, a parenting plan which limited appellant father's residential time with the parties' three children because of appellant's domestic violence history. The modified order suspended appellant's visitation rights indefinitely pending his completion of a mental health program and the children expressing a desire to renew contact with appellant. Appellant challenged, arguing numerous trial court errors, improper venue, and violation of his constitutional rights as a parent. The Court found that: venue was proper; appellant's claims of abuse of discretion by the trial judge's refusing to recuse herself, denial of a continuance, and admission of alleged hearsay lacked merit; and appellant's constitutional rights were not violated, because the State had a compelling interest in protecting the children's safety and welfare. Due to the complete lack of merit in appellant's challenge, respondent was awarded attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile brought a video camera to his high school and videotaped three female classmates while they exposed their breasts and buttocks. One of the classmates, a 15-year-old, who was several months older than appellant, reluctantly agreed to expose her breasts for the camera only after appellant followed her around and repeatedly asked her. Appellant then showed the recording to several classmates. Appellant was subsequently charged in juvenile court with three counts of sexual exploitation of a minor. The juvenile court found appellant guilty of the charge involving the girl he followed, but not guilty of the two remaining counts because the participants had exposed themselves without any encouragement or communication. Appellant sought review, arguing for reversal, because the statutory definition of the term &quot;sexually explicit conduct&quot; in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.011(3)(e) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the conviction, because appellant failed to demonstrate that &sect; 9.68A.011(3)(e) was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of judgment, because appellant juvenile failed to sustain his burden of demonstrating that the statute defining sexual exploitation of a minor was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, either facially or as applied to his case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contracted with respondent water district to construct an extension between their planned development and respondent water district's water and sewer system. Respondent water district subsequently increased service rates and connection charges, which applied to most of appellants' project. Appellants sued, contending that the rate increases were illegal. The trial court granted summary judgment for respondents, and the court affirmed. Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 57.08.010, respondent water district's authority to pass and implement new connection charges depended only upon adoption of a comprehensive plan and was not conditioned upon county approval of the plan. The connection charges at issue were valid because they were based upon an adopted comprehensive plan. Pertaining to the procedures undertaken by respondent water district in increasing the rates, it was not required to provide notice of regularly-scheduled meetings pursuant to the plain language of Wash. Rev. Code tit. 57. Because public notice of the rate increase hearing was given, respondent water district's procedures did not violate appellants' due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants manufactured products in the state but primarily sold them out of state.

Plaintiffs filed this complaint alleging that the taxes constituted a taking without just compensation. They sought just compensation and a refund of the taxes paid. However, the state legislature amended the business and occupation taxes by introducing a two-way credit scheme. The court held that the credits provided in the remedial statute were the appropriate remedy. It asserted that because the credits applied retroactively, it did not discriminate against appellants. Accordingly, the court held that appellants were entitled to credits not refunds for the taxes they had paid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought relief from personal restraint in the form of the Department of Corrections' calculation of his earned early release credit under Wash.

Petitioner claimed, on several grounds, that &sect; 9.94A.150(1) was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court determined that the personal restraint petition was properly before it, and it considered the petition on the merits. However, in dismissing the petition, the court rejected petitioner's argument that the 15 percent cap pertained only to serious violent offenses that were also class A felonies and excluded sex offenses that were not violent offenses. The lower percentage of good time credit did not add to the liberty deprivation of his original sentencing. Petitioner's equal protection claim failed, as the legislative purpose behind the statute was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The statute did not violate petitioner's due process rights, and it was not a bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>

Juvenile court ordered juvenile to obey a curfew, comply with outpatient drug and alcohol treatment, attend AA meetings, abstain from possession or use of drugs and alcohol, and refrain from verbal abuse. Less than two weeks later, juvenile's parents filed a contempt motion against juvenile. The juvenile court found that juvenile violated the conditions of his ARY supervision on five separate occasions, and it held juvenile in contempt.

Juvenile moved for revision, and the revision judge concluded the imposition of a 14-day determinate sentence violated juvenile's due process rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Superior Court of King County (Washington) committing him as a sexually violent predator pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the trial court committing him as a sexually violent predator, challenging several provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09, under which he was committed, on constitutional grounds, and contending that the trial court erred in permitting testimony from appellant's victims at his commitment trial. The court affirmed. Section 71.09 was found to be civil in nature, such that it did not violate the ex post facto clause. Also, an ex post facto challenge to &sect; 71.09 had to be made facially, rather than by assessing the character of the actual sanctions imposed against appellant. Finding that there was a rational basis for treating sexually violent predators differently from other mentally ill persons with respect to release procedures, the court also rejected appellant's equal protection challenge to &sect; 71.09.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court's order was affirmed. Appellant's equal protection challenge to statute providing for commitment of sexually violent predators failed, as difference in treatment between such persons and other persons who were mentally ill, with respect to release procedures, was rational.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, appellant protestors challenged the orders of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which affirmed the anti-harassment and contempt orders against a male protestor, and affirmed the voluntary settlement agreement between the female protestor and the repressed memory therapist. The therapist obtained an anti-harassment order against the male protestor and filed suit against the female protestor for defamation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A repressed memory therapist was the target of various protests and picketing. The therapist obtained an anti-harassment order against the male protestor, which prevented him from coming within 300 feet of the therapist's clinic and from contacting him or placing him under surveillance with cameras or video equipment. The protestor was found in contempt of the order, and he appealed the order and the contempt ruling. The superior court found the order impermissibly intruded on the protestor's First Amendment rights, but it affirmed the contempt order because the erroneous portions of the order were voidable. The female protestor, after being sued by the therapist, executed a settlement agreement, which she renounced. The superior court granted a motion to enforce the settlement and she filed a motion to invalidate it as unconstitutional, which was denied. Both cases were consolidated, and affirmed. The court held that the restrictions placed on the male protestor were necessary to enforce the no contact provisions. It held that the female protestor knowingly and voluntarily waived her constitutional rights, and that there was no state action involved in her settlement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the anti-harassment order because the order did not violate the male protestor's First Amendment rights. The limits on his First Amendment rights were needed to enforce the no contact provisions of the order. The court affirmed his conviction for contempt in violating the order. It affirmed the female protestor's settlement agreement because it was knowingly and voluntarily entered into by the female protestor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sheriff's deputy stopped appellant after appellant nearly collided with the deputy's patrol car. Appellant's stop and detention began a series of events that culminated in appellant's arrest and conviction for assault in the second degree, assault in the third degree with a firearm enhancement, and unlawful possession of a firearm. At trial, the trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress, under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.6, the evidence seized in the deputy's stop and detention of appellant. On appeal, appellant contended that the deputy had no lawful basis to stop and detain appellant. The court affirmed. Appellant was not driving at a speed appropriate for the conditions, and skidded three times before coming to a stop in a 25-mph zone. Appellant would likely have collided with the deputy had the deputy not moved his vehicle into the oncoming lane of travel. These facts gave the officer a reasonable suspicion allowing him to stop and detain appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that: the prosecution did not provide sufficient evidence that any of the three elements of stalking under the stalking statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.110(1), were met, appellant's actions did not meet the definition of &quot;follow&quot; under the stalking statute because he did not deliberately maintain contact with the victim, and the stalking statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. The court concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that appellant followed the victim. Appellant regularly parked in front of mailboxes near the victim's house during times when the victim was in the neighborhood, he got out of his car just as the victim was walking toward him, and he was seen in the victim's yard. Neither the victim's father nor the victim's friend saw appellant while the victim was out of town, but appellant reappeared in his parked car once the victim returned. A person of ordinary understanding would have been capable of determining that appellant's conduct constituted repeated &quot;following.&quot; Thus, the stalking statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted in 1987 of rape, and before his Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09 commitment trial, argued to be allowed to present expert testimony as to what kind of less restrictive alternative would be acceptable to reduce his likeliness of reoffending. The trial court ruled the evidence inadmissible, as it would confuse the jury because the trial court did not have authority to grant an alternative placement. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial. Appellant had the right to challenge whether or not the state had met its beyond-a-reasonable-doubt burden of proving no less restrictive alternatives were appropriate since that went to the SVPA definition of &quot;sexually violent predator.&quot; Wash. R. Evid. 403's grant of discretion to the trial court to exclude relevant evidence if its potential to confuse outweighed its probative value, did not extend to the exclusion of crucial evidence relevant to appellant's valid central contention. As state did not show that appellant was disruptive, making him wear a shock belt at trial was inappropriate. The SVPA, a civil law, was not an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed and remanded for new trial. Where &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; categorization in civil commitment statute required showing beyond reasonable doubt that confinement was necessary to prevent reoffense, trial court erred to exclude appellant's expert evidence that less restrictive treatment would reduce his likeliness of reoffending. The Sexually Violent Predator Act was not an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant condominium owners and association sued appellee contractors. Appellants alleged mostly negligence-based claims involving a condominium-building project begun in 1988. By September of 1990, the City of Seattle had issued a certificate of occupancy and cleared construction permits. In January of 1997, the storm occurred that made them uninhabitable. Appellees moved for summary judgment. They alleged the six-year statute of repose, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.310, barred appellants' causes of action. The trial court granted the motion. Appellants challenged that holding. The court affirmed. The court held appellants' causes were time-barred under the statute as work on the condominiums had been substantially completed more than six years before the damage occurred. The court also held the statute survived constitutional attack because it did not impermissibly deny access to the courts, and did not impair rights under either the federal equal protection clause or the state privilege and immunities clause.</SPAN></P>

Appellant provided the additional information, but did not get a response on the application until nearly two months after the last resubmission when appellee denied the application.

Under Snohomish County, Wash., Code &sect; 20.20.030, appellee was required to render a decision on the application within thirty days of when the application was complete for processing. This section envisioned a two-step completion process. Appellant's application reached only step one of the process and therefore the thirty-day requirement was never triggered. Appellee violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70B when it failed to render a decision within fourteen days of appellant's resubmission. However, appellant was not injured by appellee's delay because appellant's failure to include a required health district certification and failure to provide for future construction of a public road meant his application could not have been approved under existing law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was recently suspended from school when he told two classmates that he and a neighbor had a plan to kill the school principal. The classmates told authorities and defendant was charged with violation of the harassment statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.020. Defendant claimed the state had to prove that defendant knew his threats would reach the principal in order to obtain a conviction. The court affirmed. The state did not have to show that defendant knew the principal would learn of the threat in order to obtain a conviction. The most natural grammatical construction of the harassment statute was that the adverb &quot;knowingly&quot; modified only the verb phrase that it immediately preceded, which was &quot;threatens to cause bodily injury.&quot; This was supported by legislative intent, which reflected the possibility that the threatened person could feel in reasonable fear whether the person who made the threat intended for them to hear the threat or not. The conviction was supported by sufficient evidence, because the threat was made shortly after a recent school shooting and because the principal knew defendant was emotional, had learned of the threat, and was in reasonable fear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision, finding that the state did not have to prove that defendant knew or should have known that his threats would reach the threatened person in order to obtain a conviction under the harassment statute, because legislative intent and grammatical construction of the statute clearly did not support such an understanding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hired contractor to repair defendant's roof. Contractor hired plaintiff to assist in the repairs. Plaintiff fell from the roof and was injured. Contractor had failed to pay the industrial insurance premium to cover plaintiff's work. Defendant paid the overdue premium after the injury, and was found to be immune from liability under the Industrial Insurance Act (Act), Wash. Rev.

Defendant was not plaintiff's employer and could not be immune on that basis. Defendant did not control any aspect of plaintiff's work. Defendant did not acquire immunity solely from his payment of the insurance premium. As a non-employer, defendant could not erase plaintiff's common law cause of action simply by paying the industrial insurance premium months after the accident.

Rev. Code &sect; 26.19.090 and to pay plaintiff ex-wife attorney fees under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.140.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's judgment modifying a child support order by directing him to pay postsecondary education support as provided by Wash.

The trial court determined that the son and his parents should each pay one-third of his college costs and that defendant should pay $ 1,000 of plaintiff's ex-wife's attorney fees. On appeal, the court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.19.090 did not violate the equal protection clauses of either the United States or State of Washington constitutions because, under the rational basis test, the law affected all divorced parents in the same manner. However, because the court failed to direct that the parents' payments be made directly to the postsecondary school under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.19.090(6), the court remanded for further consideration as to whom the payments should be sent. The trial court also erred by failing to enter a finding that the son was dependent as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.19.090(2) and by failing to consider the financial resources of both parties before awarding attorney fees under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.140.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants represented a class claiming that respondent state department of labor and industries should have adopted a rule mandating a blood-testing program to monitor their exposure to organophosphate and carbamate compounds, the most widely used pesticides on Washington crops. Respondent issued a recommended non-mandatory monitoring program for pesticide handlers in 1993; when it did not alter the non-mandatory character, appellants filed their action for declaratory judgment in 1997, relying on Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 49.17.050(4), 49.17.240(2), part of the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act. The trial court denied the petition. The court reversed, holding that while respondent had some discretion in deciding when and in what areas to initiate rule making, respondent's own investigation revealed that the proposed regulation would have materially reduced a significant risk, and respondent could not have decided not to regulate. The mandatory language of the act required regulation.</SPAN></P>

Appellants made reasonable efforts to address the problem, and had not permitted the existence of the nuisance in the sense of having allowed it, furthered it, or condoned it. The statute, on its face, was not a taking without just compensation. The statutory language imposed an impossible burden. The abatement of a business could not be based on illegal acts of business patrons where appellant owners were not involved in or aware of the illegal activity. Imposition of the closure order was a taking under U.S. Const. amend. V for which compensation was required.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the possession of burglary tools conviction, concluding that although defendant possessed numerous door keys, files and picks, the circumstances did not indicate an intent on defendant's part to use them to commit burglary. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of methamphetamine; neither the admission of the documentary evidence nor the prosecutor's allegedly improper closing argument caused reversible prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Finding no error, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The challenged instruction correctly stated the law, as the instruction allowed jury to find that the display element of the crime of first degree robbery was met even where a victim did not actually see the firearm. Because the instruction correctly stated the law, defendant's argument that it was an improper comment on the evidence failed. The evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant displayed what appeared to be a weapon, and the evidence was sufficient to support jury's conclusion that defendant committed the three robberies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who had filed an unsuccessful preliminary plat application with respondent county, appealed judgment of the Klickitat County Superior Court (Washington), which upheld board of county commissioners' decision that the application was deficient in its plan for water, sewer, and roads.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a preliminary plat application with respondent county's planning department, seeking to subdivide 9.64 acres into 20 residential lots. The application additionally listed the 9.64 acres in a commercial zone &quot;not necessarily to be used for commercial use.&quot; The board of county commissioners for respondent county denied the application. Issue on appeal was whether trial court erred by affirming the board's denial of the plat application for failing to make adequate provision for water, sewer, and roads, and concluding evidence and the law supported the board's decision. The court affirmed trial court's decision, noting that the board made the final decision on whether to accept or reject the plat application; thus, the board did not err. Appellant did not meet the threshold showing for an unconstitutional takings claim. Respondent county's road requirements served the legitimate public purpose of ensuring future residents safe and adequate access to the development and of promoting road safety. The record did not show bias or prejudgment by the board, or that they relied on evidence outside of the record in reaching their decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed convictions for child molestation and attempted child molestation in the Superior Court of Clallam County (Washington), arguing that the trial court erred by: denying his motion to substitute new counsel; admitting evidence under Wash. R. Evid. 404(b); failing to give the jury proposed special verdict form; and imposing exceptional sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before trial commenced, defendant asked that his court-appointed attorney withdraw because of a conflict of interest. The trial court denied the motion to substitute counsel and subsequently, a jury convicted defendant of child molestation and attempted child molestation. At sentencing, the trial court imposed an exceptional sentence. The appellate court affirmed, holding that although defendant's statement that his attorney said he did not want to see defendant win, if true, may have been reason to substitute counsel, such error, if any, was harmless. The appellate court further held that evidence of defendant's leather fetish was admissible under Wash. R. Evid. 404(b) to show defendant's lust toward child victims. Child's testimony alone was sufficient evidence to support jury's finding that defendant's actions demonstrated substantial step. Last, the appellate court found that the trial court's imposition of an exceptional sentence based upon future dangerous and abuse of trust was justification for departing from the standard sentencing range.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; evidence of defendant's lustful disposition towards victims was admissible. When defendant, unrelated adult with no caretaking function touches child's intimate parts, such actions supported jury's inference that touching was for purpose of sexual gratification. Future dangerousness aggravating factor, applicable only to sexual offenses, was supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minors appealed from the Superior Court, Yakima County (Washington) which, after finding them to be at-risk youths and entering disposition orders, held them in contempt for violating those orders, and imposed terms of confinement on them as a sanction for the contempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, three at-risk youths, violated their respective disposition orders, and were held in contempt. The lower court imposed confinement on each minor as sanctions. On their appeal, claiming the trial court lacked authority to impose the sanctions and violated their due process rights, the court reversed the orders of contempt and the sanctions imposed. Although appellants had all served their confinements, the issue was not moot because of the public nature of the issue and the likelihood of recurrence. Although the sanction statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.32A.250(2) and (3), as amended, spoke in terms of &quot;remedial&quot; sanctions, implying civil contempt, the lower court imposed a determinate sentence, without a purge clause, on each minor because he or she had violated a court order. This was a punitive sanction and therefore the contempt was criminal. Because criminal contempt proceedings must be initiated by a criminal information filed by the state, and the appellants' parents initiated the proceedings, the appellants' due process rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Orders of contempt and sanctions imposed were reversed. The sentences imposed on appellants were determinate and lacked purge clauses, so the contempt was criminal, in spite of &quot;remedial&quot; language in the statute. The state was therefore required to file informations for criminal contempt to comply with due process.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code 9.41.250(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer saw defendant walking down the street with his hand in his pocket. He was ordered to stop because he had an outstanding warrant. The officer observed defendant take one hand out of his pocket and drop something. He handcuffed defendant and found a paring knife on the ground. The state charged defendant with furtively carrying with intent to conceal a dangerous weapon, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code 9.41.250(2). The juvenile court found defendant guilty. On appeal, defendant claimed the court did not enter a separate finding of fact identifying the specific evidence upon which it relied to find furtive conduct, and failed to enter either a factual finding or a conclusion of law regarding intent to conceal. The appellate court concluded that by entering findings such as how defendant had his hands in his pocket, was ordered to stop, and dropped a paring knife, the juvenile court satisfactorily specified the evidence on which it relied. While the court did not enter a separate conclusion of law that defendant acted with intent to conceal, it was apparent from the record the court was aware of the element and found the state had proven it beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's adjudication of guilt was affirmed; the evidence was sufficient to sustain the court's adjudication of guilt and the court adequately specified the evidence it relied on to conclude defendant acted furtively.</SPAN></P>

Trial court did not err in admitting defendant's custodial statements in response to interrogation by the authorities, and it correctly determined that defendant impliedly waived his rights by his comments in response to the detective's actions and questions. Trial court did not err in not suppressing a montage identification and a lineup identification, as neither was improperly suggestive.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, King County (Washington), convicted defendant, an attorney, of four counts of first degree theft and two counts of second degree theft, after finding that the charges, filed by the state almost six and one-half years after the last of the alleged offenses occurred, were not untimely because of the tolling provision of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.080 (1996). Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the tolling provision subjected her to perpetual liability for the felony theft charges and violated the Commerce Clause. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that defendant failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the tolling statute was unconstitutional.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.080(2) (1996) provided that the period of limitations of three years for prosecutions for criminal offenses did not run during any time when the person charged was not usually and publicly resident within the state. Because defendant was absent from the state during the time period, the statute of limitation was tolled. The court found that the state's interest in prosecuting alleged violations of its criminal laws was sufficiently significant to justify burdening a person's fundamental constitutional right to travel from one state to another. Moreover, the state's interest in prosecuting crimes was compromised when a person facing charges left the state because investigation generally was more difficult. Further, conserving state resources by avoiding extradition was a reasonable basis for the state's reliance on the tolling provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed judgment of the Thurston County Superior Court (Washington), which convicted defendant of one count of burglary in the first degree and three counts of violations of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, each with a firearm enhancement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, and the State conceded, that trial court erred when it gave an instruction to jury because it improperly shifted the burden of proof to defendant. In affirming judgment, the court found the instruction violated defendant's due process rights by relieving the State of its responsibility to prove the intent element of the crime of burglary beyond a reasonable doubt, but the court held that there was overwhelming evidence of his intent to commit a crime such that any reasonable jury would have so found, and the error was harmless. Regarding defendant's claim that trial court erred in failing to give his proposed instruction of a defense to burglary, the court held that trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to give this proposed instruction. Regarding defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the court found that there was no reasonable probability verdict would have been different, even assuming an error by counsel. Thus, defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged errors of his attorney. Trial court did not violate double jeopardy by convicting defendant on all three controlled substances counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; although improper instruction on burglary impermissibly shifted burden of proof with respect to defendant's intent, there was overwhelming evidence of his intent to commit a crime such that any reasonable jury would have so found, and the instruction error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his convictions and sentence from Superior Court of Kittitas County (Washington), where counsel failed to submit an instruction on unwitting possession as a defense to drug possession and appellant was given consecutive sentences for first degree assault and second degree assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his convictions and sentence for first and second degree assault, drug possession, and firearm possession. The court found a unanimity instruction as to the specific act of assault was not necessary because prosecution relied specifically on the actual shooting as proof of first degree assault. Appellant was not so drunk that he lacked ability to form intent. Judge's comment that he believed witness's statement was the whole truth was not error. Counsel's failure to ask for an unwitting possession defense instruction was error and drug possession conviction was reversed. Appellant testified he was unaware of the methamphetamine baggie in his pocket and others had reached into his pocket while he was being held at gunpoint before deputies arrived. Imposing consecutive sentence for both first and second degree assault was error where second degree assault was not a serious offense and no exceptional sentence was ordered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Drug possession conviction reversed and sentence reversed because appellant was entitled to the unwitting possession defense to drug possession and counsel erred in failing to submit the instruction; first and second degree assault sentences should not have been consecutive where second degree assault was not a serious offense by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of convictions for second degree murder, first degree assault and unlawful possession of a firearm. Coroner's testimony that appellant was sighting right down the gun when it went off, killing victim, was properly admitted expert testimony. Defense counsel was free to cross-examine corner. Opinion testimony by three witnesses concerning whether it was proper for appellant to defend himself was improper lay witness testimony; however, it was not reversible error where the trial was conducted without a jury and judge was presumed capable of limiting its consideration for proper purposes. Convictions for both murder and assault was double jeopardy violation. The convictions were based on the same facts, same act, and same victim. Under the same evidence test, both required intent to inflict great bodily harm and thus constituted a double jeopardy violation. Concurrent sentencing on the two did not correct the error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, owners of a restaurant and lounge in Seattle, appealed order of King County Superior Court (Washington), which found that appellants' restaurant was a drug nuisance under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.43, ordered restaurant closed to further operation for one year, and placed the property in the court's custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city alleged that building where appellants operated their restaurant constituted a drug nuisance under drug abatement law, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.43, because of illegal drug activity on the premises. Trial court found restaurant was a drug nuisance and for one year abated and closed further operation of restaurant by and through appellants and placed the property in the court's custody. In vacating trial court's order, the court held that drug abatement law, as applied to appellants, was an unconstitutional taking of property without compensation under U.S. Const. amend. V and a violation of due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Drug abatement law, when applied to appellants for illegal acts of patrons, which were unknown to appellants and which were not acquiesced in by them, was unduly oppressive. Curtailing illegal drug use was a valid state interest, but not one which justified closure of restaurant on the facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined there was no prejudice arising from the self-defense instruction referring to great bodily harm because defendant did not reasonably and in good faith fear injury.

Also, the aggressor instruction was proper in this case because it was reasonably likely that his actions would provoke a belligerent response. Consequently, there could be no cumulative error. The court vacated the manslaughter conviction, however, on double jeopardy grounds. Nonetheless, his life sentence for felony murder did not violate the ex post facto clause nor constitute a bill of attainder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Defendant not prejudiced by inaccurate self-defense instruction since reasonable juror could not have found defendant believed in good faith he was in danger of injury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a commitment proceeding conducted under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09, the trial court issued an order committing appellant indefinitely as a sexually violent predator. Appellant challenged the order on appeal on several grounds. However, the court affirmed. As to appellant's contention that the trial court erred at the commitment hearing by admitting testimony of respondent state's expert witness, the court held that experts' predictions of future dangerousness in commitment hearings were sufficiently accurate and reliable to be admissible. As to appellant's challenge to the admission of evidence of his prior non-predicate sexually deviant behaviors, the court held that, in assessing whether an individual was a sexually violent predator, such conduct was highly probative of his or her future propensity for violence. The court also concluded that since appellant was incarcerated at the time of his hearing, no evidence of a recent overt act by appellant was necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of appellant's sentence for rape of a child and child molestation, the sentencing court imposed a term of community placement with certain conditions.

On appeal, the appellant contended these conditions were not authorized by statute, and alternatively, were unconstitutional because they failed to provide sufficient notice of proscribed conduct. The court disagreed and affirmed the sentence. The two conditions were statutorily authorized under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(9)(b)(ii), (c).

Moreover, the trial court ruled that the prohibition against profiting from commercialization related to the offenses was a condition of the sentence. The court reversed the sentencing court's order providing that the financial gain prohibition was a condition of defendant's sentence and struck the financial gain prohibition as a condition of community custody as well.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of communication with a minor for immoral purposes, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.090. The question before the court was whether the language of &sect; 9.68A.090 was so vague as to have been unenforceable. The court found that placed in context, a person of common intelligence need not have guessed as to the meaning of &sect; 9.68A.090. A person was subject to the proscription and penalties under &sect; 9.68A.090 by observing and photographing a nude 16-year-old for the purposes of sexual stimulation, or as part of a quid pro quo. The trial court found that defendant employed, authorized, or caused the victim, then age 16, to engage in sexually explicit conduct, by exhibiting her unclothed body for sexual stimulation of the viewer and photographs. Because defendant's resulting conduct was prohibited, any communication regarding that conduct was also prohibited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; defendant communicated with his 16-year-old niece for the purpose of photographing her nude body, and the application of the statute that prohibited communication with a minor for immoral purposes did not result in unlikely, absurd, or strained consequences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For about five years plaintiffs wrangled with their defendant neighbors over a strip of land. Plaintiffs won a prescriptive easement over defendants' property. After defendants tried to block access to the easement with a fence, plaintiffs sued again, for contempt, violation of a court order, injunctive relief, and other causes. All of the plaintiffs' claims were dismissed on summary judgment, but defendants' counterclaims for trespass, frivolous lawsuit, and an injunction went to a bench trial. The defendants lost and appealed, contending: (1) the plaintiffs clearly prosecuted their claims maliciously; (2) the defendants were entitled to an injunction ordering the removal of plaintiff's barn that encroached on the easement by one foot; and (3) the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees. The court affirmed all but the award of attorney fees. The court held that probable cause supported plaintiffs' claims, and that the equities supported rejection of a mandatory injunction.</SPAN></P>

After petitioner was imprisoned for his consecutive sentences, he had a parole hearing in which he asserted several &quot;good time&quot; credits as reason for the granting of a parole agreement. The parole officer found him not parolable on the basis that although he had received counseling for sexual deviancy he lacked an acceptance of responsibility for two of his offenses. As a result, petitioner appealed the decision, arguing that the officer abused his discretion in failing to recognize his rehabilitated state of mind. Upon final determination, the court of appeals denied the petition, holding that the officer was well within his discretion in denying parole, especially where the &quot;good time&quot; credits bore no relation to accelerated parole eligibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was involuntarily committed to a state facility as a sexually violent predator under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.060. One year later, a trial was held to determine whether a less restrictive alternative to confinement was warranted by appellant's circumstances. The trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment, and the court affirmed. No genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether a less restrictive alternative was appropriate. The statute allowed two alternatives to commitment, either conditional release to a less restrictive alternative or unconditional discharge. Therefore, appellant's proposed plan to receive treatment in the community while still confined at the facility was not authorized. In addition, application of the civil rules of summary judgment was appropriate in this special civil proceeding since the sexually violent predator statute was not inconsistent with the civil rules, even though a higher standard of proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, was required.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130 (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the sex-offender registration requirements of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130, appellant provided authorities with the address he intended to use to pick up mail and messages. When appellant could not be located there, he was charged with failure to register as a sex offender. Appellant challenged his conviction arguing that former &sect; 9A.44.130 was unconstitutionally vague. The court agreed that the word &quot;address&quot; as used in the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not clearly indicate whether a sex offender could provide a mailing address instead of a residential address. Because of this defect, the term &quot;failure to register&quot; lacked sufficient definiteness as to the proscribed conduct. Thus, the court concluded that former &sect; 9A.44.130 was unconstitutionally vague. Moreover, even assuming that the statute was sufficiently clear as to the registration requirements, the evidence indicated that appellant could not comply with the statute as written because he was homeless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction was reversed because the word &quot;address&quot; as contained in the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutionally vague in that it did not clearly indicate whether a sex offender could register by providing a mailing address instead of a residential address.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had a previous rape conviction, was sentenced to life in prison without parole, and his appeal challenged constitutionality of the &quot;two strikes&quot; version of the Persistent Offender Accountability Act, Wash.

The court determined that no clear basis existed for distinguishing indecent liberties by forcible compulsion from other strike offenses, and it concluded that defendant's life sentence without parole for the crime of indecent liberties by forcible compulsion did not violate Washington's constitutional prohibition against cruel punishment. The nature of defendant's crime, the legislative purpose and the classification system for strike crimes, all supported conclusion the court reached, as did the facts of defendant's offense. Defendant's punishment was not grossly disproportionate to the offense he committed.</SPAN></P>

The son filed a child in need of services (CHINS) petition, which the lower court granted. Before the appeal, the lower court terminated its supervision and dismissed the CHINS petition. Appellant continued with her appeal, arguing the lower court violated her due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV by not filing a written statement of reasons as required by statute, and insufficient evidence supported granting the petition. The record demonstrated the trial court was very thorough in its oral opinion and followed the statute, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.32A, closely, preventing any prejudice to the parties. Furthermore, appellant did not show how the issues she raised were likely to recur. In short, the issues she raised were moot and not of continuing and substantial public interest. Consequently, her appeal was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, argued that the statutory prohibition on the application of the compromise of misdemeanor statute to juveniles violated the federal and state constitutional equal protection guarantees because the statutory scheme treated juveniles differently from similarly situated adults: a compromised misdemeanor resulted in no criminal history, but the consequences of a diversion was criminal history that could impact future sentences. Respondent state argued that the legislature had a rational basis for distinguishing between those adults eligible for application of the compromise of misdemeanor statute and juvenile offenders who were ineligible. The court held that the legislature's classification was rationally related to the legitimate objective of rehabilitation because the threat of increased punishment based on a prior diversion conceivably served a deterrent function and increased punishment could serve to teach the juvenile that increasingly severe consequences resulted from each incident of unlawful conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed because it found no equal protection violation where the legislature's classification that treated juveniles differently than adults for the purposes of the compromise of misdemeanor statute was rationally related to the legitimate objective of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

Among his grounds for appeal, defendant argued the trial court erred in refusing to permit him to present evidence of other suspects. Defendant's only evidence about a third-party was both limited and tangential. The court excluded evidence about the third-party for several reasons: the evidence against the third-party was insufficient to justify charges against him; two eyewitnesses identified the defendant; and, even if the evidence against the defendant had been only circumstantial, there was little or nothing to indicate that the third-party was present at the time of the shooting. The court found the evidence created barely a suspicion, especially since there was no clear indication that the third-party was even present at the scene. Thus, the court affirmed the trial court's exclusion of other suspect evidence because it was insufficient to connect another person to the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent appealed his commitment as a sexually violent predator, pursuant to Wash. Rev.

The evidence was not insufficient to commit respondent, and the record did not support respondent's claim that he was committed based upon anti-social personality traits. Respondent's failure to properly object at trial precluded review of several claimed errors. The trial court did not err in: denying respondent's challenges for cause of jurors; admitting evidence of respondent's prior convictions of nonsexual offenses; admitting expert testimony concerning scientific evidence and hearsay evidence to show the basis of such evidence; excluding evidence concerning conditions at a commitment center; excluding evidence respondent sought to introduce to impeach an expert witness; declining to instruct the jury on an improper commitment standard; and denying objections to a prosecutor's statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Grays Harbor County (Washington), which affirmed a $ 10,000 civil penalty imposed by appellee natural resources department due to appellant's failure to comply with a Forest Practices Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 76.09, reforestation order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant obtained a forest practices application to harvest 270 acres of timber from a piece of forested land he owned. Appellant completed the harvest but reforested only about 50 of the 270 harvested acres. Subsequently, the county changed the zoning and tax status of the property to from timberland to residential. Appellant then made plans to develop the property as subdivision. Appellee natural resources department fined appellant $ 10,000 for failing to reforest his land in a timely manner. On appeal, appellant contended that the fine was an invalid retroactive application of an amended statute. Under the former version of the statute, the fine was not more than $ 500. The court affirmed the $ 10,000 fine, holding the precipitating event leading to the fine occurred after the effective date of the statute's amendment. The residential zoning designation did not remove appellant's forested land from coverage under applicable statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Appellee properly applied the amended forest practices statute prospectively to appellant's failure to comply with its reforestation mandates because precipitating event was after effective date of amended statute. Re-classification from timberland to residential property was inconsequential for purpose of imposition of fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which imposed an exceptional sentence after convicting appellant of third degree rape and sexual exploitation of a minor with sexual motivation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to three counts of rape and one count of sexual exploitation of a minor with sexual motivation. Because of two prior sex offenses, appellant's offender score for each offense was high. Consequently, the trial court imposed an exceptional sentence of 180 months in prison, relying on several aggravating factors. On appeal, the court held the trial court erred by basing its sentence in part on the fact there were multiple victims because each count involved a different victim. The &quot;multiple victims&quot; factor was ruled invalid. Also, to the extent the appellant's history of sex offenses was used to distinguish him from other sex offenders with high offender scores, the factor was invalid. The trial court properly found appellant deserved harsher punishment because he committed multiple incidents of sexual abuse with each victim. Judgment was affirmed and case was remanded for clarification of community placement term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sentence was affirmed in part; the trial court properly relied on the &quot;multiple incidents&quot; factor when it determined that appellant deserved a more severe punishment due to the multiple incidents of sexual abuse with each of his victims. Case was remanded for specification of the community placement term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced to a standard range sentence of 30 months on one count and 90 days on count two, to run concurrently. Appellant was also sentenced to 24 months based on the school bus stop enhancement, to run consecutively to the underlying sentence. Appellant contended that the State violated his right to due process because the special verdict was based on his proximity to a school bus stop, the presence of which could not be readily ascertained. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435 did not forbid conduct in terms so vague that persons of common intelligence had to guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. Appellant could have discovered the location of the school bus stop by contacting the school district's director of transportation or local schools.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner criminal was convicted of second-degree murder. In his petition for relief from personal restraint, petitioner contended the trial court erred when it included in his sentence a provision for community placement &quot;for the period of time provided by the law,&quot; rather than specifying a length of time; the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction; the instruction for second degree assault omitted an essential element for that offense; the self-defense instruction was unconstitutional; the trial court commented on the evidence; the prosecutor committed misconduct by repeatedly characterizing the incident as an &quot;assault;&quot; and, cumulative error denied him a fair trial. The court agreed that the trial court erred in ordering petitioner to serve the term &quot;provided by the law.&quot; The court found the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, and the State proved he committed the underlying felony of second-degree assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after pointing a gun at two women chasing his friends who had stolen one of the women's purse. At his trial for robbery, after both sides rested, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the charging document and moved to dismiss the case. He argued that the information failed to allege he took property belonging to another person. The court denied the motion, the jury convicted defendant, and defendant appealed, arguing the information unconstitutionally omitted two elements of the crime. The court found that since defendant raised his objection after the State rested, a liberal standard applied. Under that standard, the information adequately informed defendant that the State alleged he stole property belonging to another and was not, therefore, unconstitutional. Moreover, defendant's failure to object to jury instructions on the same grounds required manifest constitutional error for the court's review. That error being absent, the conviction was upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed; the court found that since defendant waited until the State concluded its case before challenging information, a liberal standard applied.

Appellant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance while armed with a dagger, which was a per se deadly weapon. The trial court imposed a deadly weapon sentencing enhancement, Wash. Rev.

The plain and ordinary meaning of the terms &quot;knife&quot; and &quot;dagger&quot; provided adequate standards of specificity and therefore the statute did not invite an inordinate degree of discretion.</SPAN></P>

He appealed, arguing the statute he was convicted under was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. Judgment was affirmed because the court found the statute constitutional and appellant's other arguments failed. The appellant did not meet his burden of proving the statute's unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. It was not unconstitutionally vague because it contained specific conditions that gave an ordinary citizen adequate notice of what type of threats it prohibited; and not overbroad because it contained limiting factors that sufficiently restricted its scope.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tenant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which granted appellee landlord a writ of restitution and entered judgment against appellant for attorney's fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant leased a room in a rooming house from appellees' predecessor on October 2, 1997. Appellees purchased the property sometime in November and the parties entered into a residential rental agreement on November 26. The contract specified a term commencing on October 2, 1997, and terminating on April 1, 1998. During the tenancy appellant complained to appellees about housing code violations, specifically a malfunctioning furnace. He also complained to the city about the violations. Appellees served appellant with two eviction notices when he failed to vacate the premises on April 1. Appellees sued appellant for unlawful detainer. Appellant counterclaimed that the eviction was retaliatory. Appellees were granted a writ of restitution. Appellant vacated the premises on June 8, 1998. The court affirmed, holding the unambiguous rental agreement stated the lease's termination date as April 1, 1998. Because the lease was terminated, there was no question of retaliatory eviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; appellant's holdover in the premises was illegal because the residential rental agreement expressly expired on April 1, 1998, and he did not vacate the premises until June 8, 1998. The presumption of a retaliatory eviction was not applicable because the lease had already expired.</SPAN></P>
