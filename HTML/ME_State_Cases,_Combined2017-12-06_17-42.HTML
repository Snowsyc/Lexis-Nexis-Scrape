</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant step-parent of a minor child asserted that appellee biological parent of the child physically abused the child and petitioned for protection from the abuse and temporary parental rights under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, &sect; 4007(1)(G). The step-parent appealed the judgment of the District Court (Maine) which granted protection but denied an award of temporary parental rights to the step-parent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent contended that an award of temporary parental rights was not available to the step-parent who was unrelated to the child, and that any award of parental rights to the step-parent would violate the parent's constitutional rights to due process. The Maine Supreme Court held that the step-parent was entitled to an award of temporary parental rights. The parent and the step-parent were separated, the child lived with the step-parent rather than the parent, and the step-parent was thus a person responsible for the child who was entitled to seek protection of the child from abuse and temporary parental rights, regardless of the lack of any biological relationship. Further, the parent's fundamental liberty interest in parental rights was not infringed by the statutory authority of the courts to protect the child from abuse, since the state had a compelling interest in protecting the abused child from harm caused by the parent and the statute was narrowly tailored to serve the interest by limiting parental rights only to responsible persons after a finding of abuse, granting any award of rights only temporarily, and providing the parent notice and an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated in part with regard to the denial of the step-parent's petition for temporary parental rights, and the judgment was affirmed in part with regard to protection from abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by appellee department, the Bangor District Court (Maine) found, pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 4002(6), 4035 (2012), that appellant mother placed her child in circumstances of jeopardy. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the trial court erred by prohibiting her from unilaterally terminating her own parental rights without submitting to a jeopardy hearing. However, the appellate court found that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 4052(1) did not authorize a noncustodial parent to petition to terminate his or her own parental rights through a child protection proceeding. Further, contrary to the mother's argument, &sect; 4052(1) did not violate due process and equal protection. There was no fundamental right to abdicate all parental responsibilities, and &sect; 4052(1) survived rational basis review because the legislature's decision not to permit a noncustodial parent to petition to terminate his or her own rights and choose the grounds for jeopardy preserved the integrity of the child protection process. The mother was not similarly situated to a parent who surrendered and released parental rights in an adoption proceeding, and the legislature's decision not to permit a noncustodial parent who was subject to a child protection proceeding to petition to terminate his or her parental rights and choose the grounds for jeopardy was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, sex offenders, challenged a summary judgment order entered in the Superior Court, Kennebec County, Maine in favor of appellees, numerous State officials on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. The sex offenders challenged the constitutionality of Maine's Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 1999, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A, &sect;&sect; 11201-11256 (2012).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that Maine's Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 1999 (SORNA of 1999), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A, &sect;&sect; 11201-11256 (2012), as amended following the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine's decision in State v. Letalien, 2009 ME 130, 985 A.2d 4, did not violate the constitutional rights of the sex offenders. The sex offenders failed to demonstrate, through the Mendoza-Martinez factors, by the clearest proof, that the statute was so punitive in purpose or effect as to overcome the Legislature's civil intent because only factor five, whether the statute applied to behavior that was already a crime, weighed in favor of finding SORNA of 1999 punitive. Under the first Mendoza-Martinez factor, which was whether the statute imposed an affirmative disability or restraint, the statute was nonpunitive overall since Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A, &sect; 11222 significantly reduced the burden on individuals subject to the registry and requiring lifetime registration was not a significant restraint in and of itself. Therefore, SORNA of 1999 did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and Maine Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization argued that the Board abused its discretion when determining which nighttime sound level limit to apply to the applications. The court found that because the Board was responsible for regulating sound levels in order to minimize health impacts, and because when doing so it determined that the appropriate nighttime sound level limit to minimize health impacts was 42 dBA, the Board abused its discretion by approving the permit applications. Although the project's models predicted nighttime sound levels slightly below 45 dBA, the Board failed to give the nearby residents the acknowledged protection of the amended rules. Therefore, the Board's order was vacated and remand for further review using the 42 dBA nighttime sound level limit as introduced in 06-096-375 Me. Code R. &sect; 10(I)(2)(b) (2012). The State of Maine streamlined the permitting process under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 35-A, &sect; 3402 by concisely defining a &quot;scenic resource of state or national significance.&quot; Because that statutory definition rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in promoting wind energy and using an efficient permitting process, it did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment entered in the Superior Court in Somerset County, Maine, that denied his petition for judicial review of a decision of a hearing officer of appellee, the Secretary of State's Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) that denied appellant's petition for reinstatement of his driver's license pursuant to  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29-A, &sect; 2454(5) (2012).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's license had been revoked after he was convicted in 1996 on three counts of vehicular manslaughter. Appellant sought reinstatement of his license in 2011 after the completion of his sentence. During the hearing on the reinstatement application, the hearing officer allowed family members of the victims to testify as to the impact of the loss of their loved ones. The hearing officer found that there was no evidence that appellant would pose a risk to the public if his operating privileges were restored. However, the hearing officer found that the significance of the families' strong opposition to the Secretary of State issuing a driver's license to appellant outweighed appellant's need for a license. The supreme court affirmed. Based on the plain meaning of &sect; 2954(5), the hearing officer did not err by considering the testimony of the victims' families. Further, nothing in the statute required the hearing officer to consider that testimony only as it related to public safety. Rather, the unavoidable implication of the statute's language was that the victim's family members would testify as to the impact of appellant's conduct on their lives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction of domestic violence assault entered in the trial court (Maine). Defendant did not contest his conviction. However, he argued that the sentence, which included a period of two years of probation with a requirement that he participate in a certified batterers' intervention program, violated the Equal Protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6-A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to 180 days in the county jail, with all but 60 days suspended, and a period of two years of probation with a requirement that he participate in a certified batterers' intervention (CBI) program. Defendant objected to the sentence and argued that imposing two years of probation and requiring his participation in a CBI program violated his right to equal protection of the laws because the court could not impose a two-year term of probation for women. The appellate court understood that the Department of Corrections had promulgated rules that authorized CBI programs only for men, thus making two-year terms of probation available for men only. The parties disputed whether CBI programs for women actually existed, notwithstanding the absence of a regulation authorizing such programs. The parties' arguments, although undoubtedly made in good faith, were not based on facts in the record. Absent such a record, the appellate court was unable to reach the constitutional dispute before it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was vacated and the matter was remanded to develop the facts on the issues. After development of the facts and completion of the constitutional analysis, the trial court was to resentence defendant to the same term of probation or a reduced term of probation as its factual findings and legal conclusions might support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants employees sued appellee town in the Penobscot County Superior Court (Maine) for (1) review of government action pursuant to Me. R. Civ. P. 80B, (2) breach of contract, (3) unconstitutional taking, and (4) promissory estoppel regarding the town's payment of benefits. The trial court dismissed the first claim and granted the town's summary judgment motion as to the remaining claims. The employees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees said a personnel policy created an enforceable contract. The supreme court disagreed because, (1) in Maine, a legislative enactment created no contractual rights unless such an intent was clearly stated, and (2) language in Millinocket, Me., Personnel Policy &sect; A128-17(D) (1991) reserving the town's right to change benefits did not state this intent. Promissory estoppel did not require the town to pay the employees' retirement group hospitalization and life insurance premiums because (1) the town charter did not authorize alleged promises by the town manager and/or individual town council members to pay benefits, (2) no alleged promise by the town manager or individual town council members was ratified, as the only body authorized to ratify such a promise was the town council, and there was no evidence that the town council did so, and (3) the continued payment of such benefits was insufficient, as a matter of law, to constitute the town's promise. Denying the benefits was not a taking contrary to Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 or U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV because the employees did not show they had a contractual right to the benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Androscoggin County (Maine), convicting him, upon a jury's verdict, of four counts of gross sexual assault (Class B), two counts of sexual abuse of a minor (Class C), and one count of unlawful sexual contact (Class C), violations of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect;&sect; 253(2(H), 254(a)(A-2), and 255-A(1)(M) (2011).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, defendant's former stepdaughter, alleged that defendant first began touching her sexually when she was 12 years old. From the ages of 14 to 16, defendant engaged in vaginal, oral, and anal sex with her. The victim also alleged that defendant, who practice hypnotherapy, used hypnosis when they had intercourse in order to calm her. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the victim and her mother to testify under Me. R. Evid. 701 about defendant's use of hypnosis because the testimony was largely factual, based on personal knowledge, and was not a matter of opinion. Furthermore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it permitted the introduction of evidence under Me. R. Evid. 403 regarding defendant's use of hypnosis because the danger of any unfair prejudice did not outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Finally, although the trial court omitted the term &quot;similar&quot; when responding to the jury's request for clarification regarding the instruction for gross sexual assault, the instructions were sufficient to inform the jury of the elements required for it to find defendant guilty pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 253(2)(H).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, the Lewiston District Court (Maine) convicted defendant of domestic violence assault (Class D), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 207-A(1)(A) (2011). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying her motion to enlarge time to file a jury trial request after the 21-day deadline of Me. R. Crim. P. 22. The appellate court found, however, that at defendant's arraignment, both an instructional video and the trial court informed defendant of the need to file a jury trial request form within 21 days. The motion to enlarge time was properly denied. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of Rule 22. Because the procedural rules at issue did not impinge on the right to a jury trial, strict scrutiny did not apply. The Maine Judicial Branch was actively implementing Unified Criminal Dockets (UCDs) in the state, and the creation and launch of the Bangor and Cumberland County UCDs, with their associated rules, were the first phase. There was a strong rationale for making these changes to criminal procedure incrementally. Because there was a sound and rational basis for implementing UCDs in phases, use of Rule 22(a) did not violate equal protection. The fact that UCDs had not been implemented statewide did render the otherwise constitutionally compliant procedural rules applied by the non-UCD courts constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A quarry operator filed an action under Me. R. Civ. P. 80B, seeking to enjoin a city from enforcing certain zoning ordinances against it. The city counterclaimed under Me. R. Civ. P. 80K and Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30-A, &sect; 4452 (2011). A group of three neighbors intervened. The Business and Consumer Docket (Maine) affirmed the zoning board of appeals decision, and approved and entered a consent decree. Two neighbors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consent decree effectively treated quarrying activity at the property as a grandfathered use that is not subject to the zoning ordinances' current prohibition against extractive industries, adopted performance standards that delimited the use, and established a scheme for the enforcement of those standards. The trial court concluded that the city had the power to settle the claims as part of its right to sue and be sued, that the opponents to the consent decree received ample notice and an opportunity to be heard, and that it would not second guess the city's judgment that it was in the city's best interest to settle the litigation with the operator rather than risk an adverse result after trial. The consent decree's enforcement provision was unenforceable. The performance standards did not fall within the standards that could have been enforced pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30-A, &sect; 4452 (2011) because the consent decree adopted performance standards without those standards having been formalized through a contract zone agreement or by amendments to the land use ordinance, as authorized under the city's home rule authority to regulate land use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as to the denial of an evidentiary hearing and the determination that the City had the authority to settle the litigation through a consent decree declaring the operation of a quarry on its property to be a grandfathered use under the City's zoning ordinance. Otherwise, the court vacated the judgment and remanded the matter to the Business and Consumer Docket for proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme judicial court held that a legal standard different from that used by the trial court applied. The anti-SLAPP statute could not be invoked to achieve dismissal of claims alleging abuses of process without giving the plaintiff the opportunity to establish a prima facie case to support the claims. Upon a special motion to dismiss, a nonmoving party's action or claim had be allowed to proceed unless the nonmoving party failed to make a prima facie showing that any, rather than all, of the petitioning activities by the moving parties were devoid of any reasonable factual support or arguable basis in law. If the candidate failed to make a prima facie case that any of MDP's petitioning activities in Maine were devoid of any reasonable factual support or arguable basis in law, the action had to be dismissed because there would be no basis for the courts to assert jurisdiction over actions that occurred only in other states. A plaintiff could meet its burden of proof if, through the pleading and supporting and opposing affidavits, the plaintiff presented some evidence&quot; that the defendant's petitioning activity was devoid of factual or legal support and caused actual injury.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that defendant's consent to search was not voluntary, granted the motion to suppress the tape, but denied the motion to suppress the victim's testimony. Defendant argued that the witness's testimony should have been suppressed because they would not have been identified if it were not for the illegal search of his apartment and seizure of the tape. The appellate agreed that the consent was not voluntary but that application of the Ceccolini factors weighed in favor of admitting the live-witness testimony. The trial court found, among other things, that the witnesses testified of their own free will, that there was a possibility that the witnesses could come forward in the future, and that the purpose of the detective's search was not to identify the then unknown victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In adoption proceedings, the Hancock County Probate Court (Maine) denied appellant putative father's petition to establish his parental rights to the child pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 18-A, &sect; 9-201 (2011), and granted the petition of appellees, the child's guardians, to terminate appellant's parental rights pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 18-A, &sect; 9-204 (2011). Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With the guardians' adoption petition, the child's mother submitted an affidavit of paternity stating the father was unknown. She later advised appellant he was the father and filed an affidavit of paternity to that effect; he filed an acknowledgement of paternity. The trial court assumed, for purposes of the adoption proceeding, that he was the father but terminated his parental rights under &sect; 9-204 based on the child's best interest. The high court found substantial doubt as to whether he was the father, as the mother believed that he was based solely on the child's appearance, and she conceded that someone else could be the father. The uncertainty as to the child's paternity could not be overcome by mutual agreement between the mother and appellant that he was the father. Moreover, the guardians failed to meet their burden under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 4055 (2011) to establish at least one ground of appellant's parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence before the child's best interests could be considered. To the extent In re Baby Duncan, 976 A.2d 935 (Me. 2009), suggested that termination could be based solely on the child's best interest, it was overruled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated and the case was remanded to the trial court for DNA testing. If appellant was determined to be the father, the trial court was instructed to reconsider the prior guardianship order.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 33 controlled and did not offend the FOAA, and (2) Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 33, &sect; 651 (2011) said it did not govern. Ch. 378 applied retroactively because (1) the legislature explicitly so intended, despite Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, &sect; 302, and (2) this was not unconstitutional. The statute did not violate separation of powers, under Me. Const. art. III, &sect; 2, because it did not usurp adjudicatory power. It did not violate due process because it (1) had a rational basis and (2) was not arbitrary or capricious. It did not violate equal protection because (1) plaintiffs were not treated differently, and (2) it was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. It did not violate the takings clause in Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 because it impaired no legitimate property interest. It was not special legislation, under Me. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Penobscot County Superior Court (Maine) denied defendant's motion to motion to strike a conviction offered by the State to enhance his current charge to a Class C crime, he entered a conditional guilty plea to operating after habitual offender revocation (OHR) and was sentenced to seven months in jail. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To enhance the OHR charge from a Class D to a Class C offense, the indictment alleged that defendant had previously been convicted of operating under the influence of intoxicants (OUI). He argued that the OUI conviction was imposed illegally because it was based on a guilty plea that was not knowing and voluntary, as the judge had not informed him of his rights pursuant to Me. R. Crim. P. 5, and his attorney had not explained his constitutional rights, the penalties he faced, and his duty to immediately pay any fine imposed. The high court held that a defendant whose criminal charge or sentence was subject to enhancement because of a prior conviction could not, in the current prosecution, collaterally attack the prior conviction based on any claim other than the deprivation of the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI.  Defendant did not claim he was denied his right to counsel, only that his counsel failed to advise him of his constitutional rights pursuant to Rule 5; moreover, he did not claim he would not have pled guilty but for counsel's alleged deficiency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer sought review of a decision of appellee superintendent which determined that the insurer's proposed rate increase for its individual health insurance products of 9.2 percent that contained a built-in risk and profit margin of 3 percent was excessive and unfairly discriminatory and indicated that an increase of 5.2 percent would be approved. The Business and Consumer Docket (Maine) affirmed. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer argued that the decision violated Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, &sect; 2736 (2011) and the United States and Maine Constitutions because the rate increase eliminated its opportunity to earn a reasonable profit. The appellate court disagreed. The superintendent's interpretation of &quot;inadequate&quot; as a standard that protected an insurer's &quot;financial integrity&quot; comported with other jurisdictions. A built-in risk and profit margin was not guaranteed by the definition of &quot;inadequate,&quot; or by the rating approval framework for individual health insurance products more generally. The superintendent's interpretation of the term &quot;inadequate&quot; passed the reasonableness test, in part because &sect; 2736 was devoid of language suggesting that the superintendent had to consider an insurer's profit in approving rates for individual health insurance products. The superintendent also applied a reasonable interpretation of the term &quot;excessive,&quot; and employed a reasonable approach in arriving at her decision that the insurer's proposed rate increase was &quot;excessive.&quot; Because the insurer suffered no losses, and anticipated a profit on the approved rates, there was no unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant conceded that he did not have a fundamental right to possess marijuana, but insisted that the prohibition violated his fundamental right to liberty and to property. The Supreme Judicial Court found, inter alia, that there was a rational explanation for the Legislature's decision to proscribe the possession of marijuana. There was evidence that marijuana was harmful. In addition, the manner of exercising the police power--imposing a maximum civil fine of $1000 for possession of up to 2-1/2 ounces of marijuana--could not be described as arbitrary or capricious. Therefore, the Legislature's decision to proscribe the possession of marijuana in &sect; 2383(1)(A) did not violate defendant's right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One count charged three victims' attempted murder. The supreme judicial court held it was no error to instruct the jury defendant could be convicted if it found attempted murder was proved as to any victim because (1) it was properly asked to return a general attempted murder verdict as to any of the three victims, (2) defendant sought no instruction that attempted murder had to be proved as to at least one victim, and (3) it could be concluded one incident was charged, not three incidents with three victims. A proposed instruction requiring the jury to find attempted murder was proved as to all three victims was improper because it did not follow Maine law or general verdict jurisprudence. Sufficient evidence supported the conviction because it showed defendant and his accomplice (1) went to the victims' home to murder one victim and any witnesses to the murder, and (2) took a substantial step toward committing the murders. The evidence was sufficient to find &quot;premeditation-in-fact&quot; and &quot;extreme cruelty,&quot; under Me. Rev. Stat.

The State argued that the motion for a new trial was properly denied because postconviction review was the exclusive avenue for judicial review of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The supreme judicial court concluded that defendant had to avail himself of the postconviction review process, even if, as he argued, it was unclear that his claim could succeed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Cumberland County Superior Court (Maine), defendant was convicted of criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon (Class C) (Me.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant yelled at the victim that he was trespassing and said he would shoot him if he did not turn around. The victim ran into nearby woods; defendant exited his trailer with an assault rifle and began shooting in the victim's direction. The trial court charged the jury pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 104(1) (2010) that defendant had a right to use nondeadly force to defend his premises, and defined &quot;deadly force&quot; to include discharging a firearm in the direction of another person. Defendant argued that the &quot;in the direction of another person&quot; element of the definition of deadly force in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 2(8) (2010) was unconstitutionally vague. The high court disagreed. As defendant told a detective he fired into a woodpile in the direction he had seen the victim walking, the deadly force definition was not vague when applied to the facts. Verdicts of not guilty of reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon and guilty of threatening with a dangerous weapon were not inconsistent. The evidence did not justify an instruction on the lesser-included offense of criminal threatening, and the instructions actually given were proper.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2125 prescribed a procedure defendant could use. The court also lacked jurisdiction because his motion was not a civil declaratory judgment motion, since he filed no civil complaint under Me. R. Civ. P. 57. Treating the motion as a post-conviction review petition did not give the court jurisdiction because he (1) did not raise the issue in a prior post-conviction petition, as Me. Rev. Stat.

The motion was time-barred as a post-conviction review petition, under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2128 (2010), because (1) the time for a direct appeal from his convictions expired over one year before he filed his motion, and (2) he knew of the issue over one year before filing the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty in the Waldo County Superior Court (Maine) to robbery, under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 651(1)(C) (2010), kidnapping, under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 301(1)(A)(3) (2010), and attempted murder, under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 152(1)(A) (2010), and received an aggregate sentence of 50 years, with all but 45 years suspended. He appealed his sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said his sentences violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The supreme judicial court disagreed because (1) the facts supported his maximum sentence for attempted murder, and (2) his constitutional claim regarding his sentences' legality was limited to whether each sentence was cruel or unusual, which it was not. He was not denied a jury trial when the trial court made findings under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1256(2) (2010) in imposing consecutive sentences resulting in a sentence greater than the maximum for any individual crime because no constitutional violation occurred when the sentence for each crime did not exceed that crime's maximum. His consecutive sentences did not violate Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1256(3)(B) (2010) because (1) the robbery did not facilitate, nor was it facilitated by, the kidnapping and attempted murder, as his criminal objective substantially changed from stealing the victim's property to killing her, and (2) his motivations for the two sets of crimes differed, as the robbery was committed because he wanted money, while the kidnapping and attempted murder were motivated by a desire to avoid punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer sought judicial review in the Superior Court (Maine) of the decision of appellee Superintendent of the Bureau of Insurance (Superintendent) denying the insurer's request for a rate increase for its health insurance product for the year 2009. The trial court affirmed the Superintendent's decision, and the insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The approved rates did not give the insurer a profit margin. The supreme judicial court held the matter was moot because (1) the insurer could obtain no financial relief, as the rate year was over, and it could not recover higher rates from the subscribers for that year, (2) despite a continuing controversy over the following year's rates, a decision involving the 2009 rates would have no practical effect, as the Superintendent allowed a small profit margin for the following year, so such a direction from the court was unnecessary. The exception for issues capable of repetition yet evading review did not apply because the precise issues presented would not likely recur, as (1) the rate year in question was unique, and (2) rates approved for the following year allowed a small profit margin. The exception for questions of &quot;great public concern&quot; did not apply because (1) the enactment of significant federal legislation and (2) the possibility that a new Governor and substantially changed legislature would eliminate the ambiguity giving rise to the appeal signaled a potential for substantial change in the regulatory environment governing health insurance rates.</SPAN></P>

During the competency exam defendant asserted her right to remain silent. The examiner found defendant competent to stand trial. The record indicated neither clear error nor abuse of discretion in the trial court's ordering the competency examination, finding her competent to stand trial, and permitting her to represent herself with assistance of available standby counsel. At trial, defendant's opening statement was disrespectful of the trial court and the jury. At one point, defendant swore at the judge. Later defendant got up from her seat, walked out of the courtroom, and refused to return. Defendant refused the trial court's offer to provide a room where she could hear the proceedings. The trial court properly completed the proceedings despite defendant's provocations and demands for recusal. Defendant received a fair trial despite her continually disruptive and disrespectful conduct toward the trial court and the jury.</SPAN></P>

Code R. &sect; 011-11.19(1)(D) (2009), a scallop-fishing catch-measurement regulation published to implement Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12,  &sect; 6728 (2009). The crewman appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A department of marine resources officer testified that he picked out the smallest shucked scallops (&quot;meats&quot;) from the fisherman's catch, put them in a pint can, and counted them. He cited the fisherman for possessing over 35 meats per pint, the measure limit specified in &sect; 011-11.19(1)(D). The fisherman argued that the regulation, as applied through the sampling method used in his case, was unconstitutionally vague because it did not specify whether the officer would take a &quot;random&quot; or &quot;culled&quot; sample of the harvested scallop meats. The high court held that &sect; 011-11.19(1)(D) (2009), as applied through the culled sampling method used to determine compliance, forced fishermen to guess at how it would be applied, failed to give them adequate notice as to what fishing practices would comply with the law, promoted practices harmful to the conservation purpose of the law, and forced the courts to be uncertain in their interpretation of the law. As such, &sect; 011-11.19(1)(D), as applied through the culled sampling method, violated basic due process principles and was improperly applied to find that the crewman had committed a civil violation of &sect; 6728.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 251(1)(E) was ambiguous by allowing a finding of compulsion when a person was unable to physically repel an actor but also stating a victim had no duty to resist the actor. The statute's definition of compulsion was not ambiguous because neither its &quot;unable to physically repel&quot; nor its &quot;no duty to resist&quot; provision was ambiguous on its own, nor was any ambiguity created when they were read together, as an actor was reasonably expected to understand when he made another unable to physically repel him even if the other did not physically resist. Neither Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 251(1)(E) nor Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 253(1)(A) (2009) were void for vagueness because they were definite enough to let ordinary people know it was against the law to compel another to have intercourse through the use or threat of physical force, even if the other did not resist. The statutes were not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant because they were clear enough to give him adequate notice that his conduct was prohibited when he restrained the victim with his friend and forced intercourse on her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said state officers illegally searched his ship in a federal exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The supreme court held the search was legal because (1) the ship was registered in Maine, so (2) 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1856(a)(3) let them search under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 6306(1) (2007). Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 6001(36)'s (2009) &quot;registered vessel&quot; definition was not an overbroad basis for state jurisdiction in the EEZ because the ship was registered in Maine, so its link to Maine was not remote. Maine's marine resource law enforcement in the EEZ did not offend equal protection because a limitation to Maine vessels created no suspect class. Prosecuting under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 6432 (2007), and not Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 6952-A (2007), was not error because (1) he broke both laws, and (2) the prosecutor could elect the statute.&nbsp;Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 6431(5)'s (2007) immediate liberation defense did not apply because banded lobsters in storage totes were not immediately freed. It did not have to be shown that they were not liberated in Maine coastal waters because, under Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 6001(16) (2009), such waters included the EEZ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a conditional guilty plea, defendant was convicted of two counts of possession of sexually explicit material under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 284(1)(A) (2009). The Superior Court, Franklin County (Maine) sentenced defendant to 270 days in jail and ordered him to register as a sex offender on the first count and a consecutive 270 days, suspended, on the second count, and placed him on probation for one year.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence and oral and written statements. The supreme judicial court found no error in the denial of defendant's motion to suppress. Among other things, the supreme judicial court concluded that the warrantless search and seizure of defendant's flash drive were lawful due to defendant's consent. While the initial warrantless seizure of defendant's computer violated the Fourth Amendment and was not authorized by defendant's consent and the warrantless preview search was not justified by exigent circumstances, suppression was not required because the computer would have been inevitably discovered by the authorities through lawful means. The supreme judicial court further concluded that the State's failure to complete its forensic examination of the computer within the 10-day period established by the warrant and Me. R. Crim. P. 41(d) did not justify application of the exclusionary rule. Finally, the supreme judicial court concluded that defendant's statements were voluntarily made and no Miranda violation occurred because defendant was not in custody when the statements were made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to killing his friend. As the State did not attempt to admit any of the evidence obtained from defendant while he was in the hospital following an auto accident or the statements defendant made while in the hospital, the question of whether that evidence should have been suppressed was moot and was not considered on appeal. The trial court properly declined to suppress two statements made by defendant in separate interviews at his home. With regard to the first interview, the record supported the finding that the interview was noncustodial and that defendant had been fully instructed on his Miranda rights. While defendant was in custody at the time of the second interview, defendant was once again fully instructed on his Miranda rights. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a mistrial after psychiatrist, testifying as to why defendant's memory might be faulty, stated that people who murder other people often have memory lapses. The curative instruction given by the trial court was sufficient. Finally, the trial court's state of mind instruction correctly stated the law in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 35(1)(A) and was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment entered by the Superior Court, Franklin County, Maine, denying its motion to correct a sentence of 15 months of imprisonment, with all but 90 days suspended, two years of probation, 500 hours of community service, and a $ 1000 fine, following defendant's conviction for operating after habitual offender revocation (Class C) under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29-A, &sect; 2557-A(2)(D)(2) (2008). Defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that the sentence was facially illegal. A mandatory sentence could not be unconstitutionally disproportionate under &sect; 9 solely because of a defendant's particular circumstances. The Maine legislature mandated a sentence for defendant's conduct of two years', or 40 percent of the maximum to prevent revoked drivers with three recent operating under the influence (OUI) convictions from continuing to drive. A mandated sentence for that conduct on the lower end of the zero-to-five-years' scale was not shocking or disproportionate. Defendant's equal protection rights were not violated as the danger created by drunk drivers justified the imposition of a minimum mandatory sentence for habitual offenders with OUI convictions who continued to drive. Due process did not require that defendant be individually notified of a change in the law. Defendant's confrontation rights were not violated by the admission of a certified record from the Maine Secretary of State stating that defendant's privilege to operate had been revoked, that he had received proper notice of the revocation, and that he had three OUI convictions within the preceding 10 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that defendant had standing to challenge the detective's search of his computer. Defendant consented under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, to the initial search by stating the computer belonged to him, and leading the detective to and assisting the detective in waking up the computer. Although the detective claimed he was investigating a problem in the neighborhood of people gaining access to others' computers, he was actually investigating the dissemination of child pornography. The finding that the detective's statements were not affirmatively misleading was not clear error as the detective identified himself and indicated he was investigating a computer issue, and defendant allowed the detective to enter his home and gave him permission to search the computer. However, the consideration of subjective factors in determining the scope of defendant's consent. was improper. A reasonable person would have concluded that defendant was consenting to a search to see if someone had been accessing his computer without his permission. The detective clearly exceeded that scope when he ran a general search for all of the video files on defendant's computer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Knox County Probate Court (Maine) found that an inmate was incapacitated and designated the Department of Health and Human Services as his public guardian for the limited purpose of making psychiatric care and medication decisions pursuant to Me.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was severely afflicted with a mental illness that caused him to attempt suicide and regularly attempt to harm himself or others. However, he was often resistant to taking medications which reduced the manifestations of his illness and the risks he posed. Both parties agreed that, on a preponderance of the evidence standard, the record at the hearing supported the trial court's findings and conclusions that led to the guardianship order. The inmate argued that, while the trial court applied the standard of proof in accordance with the then-governing statute, former Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 18-A, &sect; 5-304(b) (2008), that statute was unconstitutional because it should have required at least a clear and convincing evidence standard. The trial court was not asked to address the appropriate standard of proof. The appellate court found that the trial court committed no obvious error adversely affecting substantial rights. The law at issue had been changed to require the standard of proof that the inmate asserted should have been applied. Further, no manifest injustice occurred if the lower standard of proof was applied because no different disposition would have resulted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's former girlfriend obtained an extended protective order which barred him from having any contact with her or following, stalking, or monitoring her along her work route. She then saw him parked along her work route during her commute; he was criminally charged. The high court rejected his claim that his prosecution violated his constitutional right to be on public roads. As evidence of a series of incidents allowed the jury to find that the State satisfied the &quot;course of conduct&quot; element of stalking, giving the jury only a general unanimity instruction was not error. The complaint charging him with violation of the protective order was not defective; as stalking a person along a specified route constituted contact with that person, the court that issued the protective order was authorized to prohibit defendant from stalking the victim along her work route under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, &sect; 4007(1)(D). The State charged defendant with conduct that, if proved, constituted either direct or indirect contact with the victim and satisfied the element of the crime that required a violation of a provision in a protective order that was authorized by &sect; 4007(1)(D).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty and was sentenced for sexually assaulting a child under 14. After he was released from prison but while still on probation, SORNA of 1999 was enacted. A later amendment made SORNA of 1999 apply retroactively to offenders sentenced for sex offenses or sexually violent offenses between June 30, 1992, and September 18, 1999. Under SORNA of 1999 the duration of defendant's duty to register increased from 15 years to his lifetime. The trial court held that the retroactive application of SORNA of 1999, as applied to defendant, violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The high court held that, for ex post facto purposes, SORNA of 1999 was properly evaluated on its face, not as applied; Doe v. District Attorney, 932 A.2d 552, was overruled to the extent it held otherwise. Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 11's ex post facto ban was coextensive with the corresponding prohibition in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1. SORNA of 1999 imposed an ex post facto punishment on persons sentenced before its effective date who were required to register as part of their sentence and who were then subjected to the more burdensome requirements of SORNA of 1999 after its effective date.</SPAN></P>

The Cumberland County Superior Court (Maine) restored the railroad's rights in parcel A-3 and but denied its request for attorney fees under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect;&sect; 154, 3029.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city condemned the railroad's track rights over the parcels. The trial court adopted a referee's report which found that the railroad held an easement appurtenant to the land. The trial court held that the city demonstrated public exigency as to parcels A-1 and A-2, but not A-3. The high court held that as the trial court found under Me. R. Civ. P. 54(b)(2) that the attorney fee claims were integral to the relief sought, its prior judgments were not final until it issued the fee award; thus, the city's appeal was timely. There was no basis for the trial court to reject the city's finding of exigency as to parcel A-3. Res judicata precluded the city from relitigating the issue of whether the railroad had an easement. The railroad's track rights were taken for a public use, in spite of the benefit to a private party. By its stipulation with the city, the railroad waived its right to seek relief for alleged coercion under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 154-B (2008) as to parcels A-1 and A-2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a divorce case, the Portland District Court (Maine) ordered shared parental rights and responsibilities and granted defendant mother primary residence of the parties' daughter, but also ordered primary residence to be transferred to the father in the event that the mother relocated out of state as she intended. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother alleged that father was violent and abusive and that he needed mental health treatment. None of the evaluators found him to be suffering from a mental illness. The trial court found that the father's testimony was credible while the mother's was not. The high court held that as the father conceded that the automatic-transfer-of-custody provision was ineffective because the mother had not relocated as of the date of the divorce judgment, the mother's statutory and constitutional challenges to that provision were moot. As the mother's last minute disclosure of two experts, and their failure to appear at trial, deprived the father of a reasonable opportunity to question them in person, the court did not exceed its discretion under Me.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants landowners sought judicial review in the Hancock County Superior Court (Maine) of the order of appellee Board of Environmental Protection (Board) denying their application for a permit to build a pier pursuant to the Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38, &sect;&sect; 480-A to 480-GG (2008). The trial court affirmed the order, and the landowners sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners said Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38, &sect; 480-D(1), barring unreasonable interference with existing scenic, aesthetic, recreational, or navigational uses, was unconstitutionally vague. The supreme judicial court disagreed because its operative terms were defined by (1) the NRPA, (2) their plain meaning, or (3) established legal principles. Authority to administer the statute was not unconstitutionally delegated to the Board because (1) it was subject to the Maine Administrative Procedure Act (Act), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &sect;&sect; 8001 - 11008 (2008), and, (2) under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38, &sect; 341-D(1-B), the Board had to promulgate rules, subject to the Act, to enforce the statute. The record showed the pier would unreasonably interfere with existing scenic and aesthetic uses because (1) the shoreline at issue was a &quot;resource of state significance,&quot; under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38, &sect; 480-A, (2) it was &quot;relatively undisturbed,&quot; and (3) less damaging practicable alternatives existed. Denying their application did not unreasonably regulate their common law right to wharf out from their property because the permit requirement reasonably regulated that right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order by the Aroostook County Superior Court (Maine) that granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence in the operating under the influence case brought against him; defendant claimed that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 10353(2)(G) (2008), authorizing game wardens to stop any all-terrain vehicle (ATV), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although he had no specific suspicion of any criminal activity, a game warden stopped defendant's ATV in order to check his registration and safety equipment. As defendant searched for his registration, the warden observed that defendant's movements were slow, his speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot, and his breath smelled of alcohol. The warden also noticed a beer can in one of the compartments that defendant had opened. After defendant performed field sobriety tests, he was arrested and ultimately charged with operating an ATV while under the influence. The Supreme Judicial Court found, inter alia, that because ATVs were designed, regulated, and primarily used for off-road recreation, and given the State's legitimate and substantial interest in its natural resources and protecting private property and individuals, there was a limited expectation of privacy. The intrusiveness of the stops authorized by &sect; 10353(2)(G) was minimal when compared with the State's legitimate and substantial interests in regulating ATVs. Accordingly, because defendant did not demonstrate the statute's unconstitutionality, the trial court erred in granting his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A telecommunications company appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court (Waldo County, Maine) which vacated a decision by the Town Board of Appeals ordering the approval of a project by the company's predecessor-in-interest to build a 190-foot telecommunications tower in the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company requested permission to build a telecommunications tower which was to be 190 feet tall. Although the appeal from the initial decision did not involve the definition or interpretation of the individual factors, the Planning Board chose to redefine the term &quot;tree line&quot; on remand to mean the true height of the average-sized trees. The appellate court agreed that under the new definition, any tower would be above the tree line, and that the new definition was inconsistent with Lincolnville, Me., Land Use Ordinance &sect; 19.7.2(1), which allowed telecommunications towers to be up to 195 feet tall. Accordingly, the Planning Board's original finding, that the proposed tower would not pierce the top of the tree line, resulted in a positive outcome for the company. The company met its burden of establishing the factual elements necessary for the grant of its application as five of the seven factors did not result in an adverse impact upon the scenic view, and the Planning Board's findings with respect to the remaining two factors did not rise to the level necessary to support a denial of the application. Thus, the evidence before the Planning Board compelled a positive finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738A(d) and Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, &sect; 1746(1), Maine had continuing jurisdiction subject to a determination of whether it was an inconvenient forum. The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Maine was not an inconvenient forum based on the Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, &sect; 1751(2) factors, namely, that the children were in Maine, some of their medical providers were in Maine, and the Maine courts where the divorce originated were familiar with the case. DHHS did not engage in unconstitutional selective enforcement by pursuing a child support order against him, while failing to enforce the arrears owed to him by the mother. DHHS was not bound by the mother's agreement that the father would not have to pay child support to her as she had assigned her right to child support to the State of Maine based on her receipt of public assistance (TANF) for the children and DHHS was not a party to, and therefore was not bound by, the agreement. The father was not receiving TANF while the case was pending, and thus, he and the mother were not similarly situated for purposes of child support enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, through the Attorney General and the Superintendent of Insurance, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Penobscot County (Maine), which partially denied their motion for summary judgment in a breach of a consent agreement (CA) claim filed by a former insurance company employee under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8003(5)(B) (2005). The matter arose from the State's separate CAs with the employee and the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Numerous complaints regarding the alleged improper marketing of insurance policies by the insurance company branch where the employee was the sales manager were reported. Thereafter, the employe entered into the CA with the State to resolve licensing violations associated with misrepresentations. The insurance company entered into a separate CA with the State, which required it to, inter alia, terminate the employee from his position. The employee filed suit against the State, alleging that its entry into the CA with the company, inter alia, constituted further disciplinary action in violation of his own CA. The trial court granted summary judgment to the State on all claims except as to the breach of CA claim upon finding that &sect; 8003(5)(B) constituted an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity. On appeal,  the court reviewed the statutory language of &sect; 8003(5)(B) and concluded that there was no explicit waiver of sovereign immunity that subjected the State to an action for damages. Further, there was no implicit waiver found, as the Superintendent's entry into the CA was in furtherance of his duty to protect the public interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the trial court, and remanded the matter with directions for the trial court to enter summary judgment in favor of the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners applied for permits to build a driveway over their property.

The ZBA applied the factors in &sect; 4353(4) and granted the landowners a hardship variance. The supreme judicial court held that the ZBA properly considered the landowners' setback variance request. Section 4.A.2. of the Reorganization of the Town of Mount Desert, Me., Zoning Board of Appeals authorized requests for variances from setback requirements to be considered pursuant to &sect; 4353. The town's zoning ordinance did not explicitly require that appeals from CEO decisions proceed directly to the superior court. Therefore, pursuant to &sect; 4353(1) and the case law, the landowners were required to appeal the denial of the driveway permit by seeking a variance from the ZBA. The ZBA's determination that without a driveway allowing access to the lots, the landowners would suffer the practical loss of all beneficial use of the lots was not clearly erroneous given the property's proximity to a golf course and conservation lands.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer provided coaches to an independent tour operator, which provided tour operators to conduct cruise passenger excursions on shore in Maine. The taxpayer filed use tax exemption certificates for the coaches. The Maine Revenue Service found that the coaches were not exempt instrumentalities of interstate commerce. The supreme judicial court held that the exemption did not apply to tour buses that transported cruise ship passengers on excursions within Maine. The taxpayer's coaches were not operating in interstate commerce when they took cruise ship passengers on recreational excursions within the State. The coaches did not further the passengers' interstate journey, they did not cross state lines, and they did not move the passengers from their arrival in Maine toward another state. The coach tours the taxpayer offered did not affect interstate commerce because they originated and terminated within Maine, they were optional, and the imposition of the use tax did not result in the disproportionate taxation of an interstate instrumentality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the District Court (West Bath, Maine) for having possessed four female lobsters marked with a v-notch or any female lobster that was mutilated in a manner that could hide or obliterate that mark pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 6436(1)(B) (2008). He argued that his possession of the lobsters did not fall within the prohibition as each lobster showed evidence that it had regenerated through the molting process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Department of Marine Resources Warden received complaints that defendant was keeping lobsters in violation of lobster conservation provisions including the v-notch program. The Warden met defendant's boat as it returned to the docks and inspected the catch. Out of the hundreds of lobsters in Weeks's possession, the officers identified six they believed had mutilated right center flippers and were possessed in violation of &sect; 6436. Defendant argued that the possession of the lobsters was not a violation of &sect; 6436 because the damaged flippers had regenerated after molting, and based on Bureau of Marine Patrol policy, it was not a violation of the statute to possess a lobster with a mutilated right center flipper that had subsequently regenerated. The appellate court held the four lobsters at issue bore evidence of regeneration, but they also bore evidence that their right center flippers had been mutilated in a manner so as to hide or obliterate a v-notch. The trial court did not err in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that all four lobsters were taken in violation of the v-notch law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State Tax Assessor, challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine), which granted summary judgment to appellee title insurance company and vacated the Assessor's premium tax assessment against the company for the tax years 1999 through 2002. The Assessor had imposed the tax, pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 2513 (2008), which the company appealed under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 151.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue in the case was the definition of &quot;gross direct premiums,&quot; and whether that term encompassed title examination fees collected by a title insurer's agent. The Assessor asserted that the trial court misinterpreted the meaning of the term &quot;gross direct premiums&quot; as used in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 2513 (2008). The court found that the company admitted the Assessor's statement that the deductions at issue in the case were solely for amounts retained by the company's independent agents for title search and examination fees. Ultimately, after finding that admission and examining the legislative history of &sect; 2513, the court held that, as used in &sect; 2513, the term &quot;gross direct premiums&quot; meant insurance premiums that were directly attributable to risks located or resident in Maine, and excluded from taxation premiums that were indirectly associated with such risks. Consequently, the court held that the taxable premium included the total consideration paid by the insured for the title insurance, including the cost of the title search and examination completed by the insurer or its agent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for entry of a judgment in favor of the Assessor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant operated a pub out of the ground floor of a colonial-style house, with the upper stories being used by her for living space and storage. Upon receiving a tip, the Liquor Inspections Unit, the Fire Marshal's office, and the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (MDEA) agreed that a regulatory inspection of the tavern would be performed. A representative from the Unit and four from the Fire Marshal's office entered the premises. On the third floor stairwell landing, marijuana leaves were found. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying her motion to suppress evidence because, among other things, the initial administrative inspection violated her Fourth Amendment rights because it was a pretextual inspection executed to obtain evidence to justify the search warrant and it exceeded the scope of a valid regulatory inspection. The court held that the administrative inspection was not illegal as a pretextual search but that it did exceed the permissible scope of an administrative inspection by extending to the third floor. As a result, defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's convictions and remanded the case to the trial court for suppression of the evidence obtained through the warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Tax Assessor brought a proceeding against a taxpayer, seeking to collect income taxes for the years 1996 through 1999. The taxpayers raised several affirmative defenses, including that he was not a resident of Maine during 1996-1999 but had always been a resident of Pennsylvania. The Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine), entered summary judgment in favor of the assessor. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that he was not liable for the taxes because he was not a Maine resident during the period. The trial court found, inter alia, that assessments mailed by the assessor became final by default, had res judicata effect, and barred the taxpayer from contesting residency. The taxpayer argued that the assessments were not a final judgment because, under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 174, the assessor's certificate was only prima facie evidence of the levy of the tax, of the delinquency, and of the compliance by the assessor. The appellate court disagreed. The existence of an enforcement method did not undermine the finality of the assessments. Further, the reconsideration and review procedures available gave the proceeding all essential elements of an adjudication. However, a fact issue existed as to the taxpayer's residency during 1997-1999. If the taxpayer was not a resident, the assessor acted beyond its authority in entering the assessments, which thus could not have had res judicata effect. Nevertheless, the taxpayer registered to vote in Maine in 1996 and swore then that he was a Maine resident. He was not allowed to claim that he was not a resident in 1996.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices ruled that a candidate had violated Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, &sect; 1014-A, which regulated the endorsement of political candidates. The candidate sued the Commission, seeking a ruling that &sect; 1014-A was unconstitutional because it violated the First Amendment. The Superior Court of Cumberland County, Maine, affirmed the constitutionality of &sect; 1014-A, The candidate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">About a week before a primary election, the candidate printed leaflets containing endorsements from two U.S. Senators. These endorsements had been given in a prior election for the same office, two years earlier, and the dates of the endorsements were included in the leaftets (albeit in small print). The candidate did not attempt to obtain permission from either Senator to reuse endorsements, as required by &sect; 1014-A, His opponent filed a complaint with the Commission, which found that the candidate violated &sect; 1014-A. The high court held that as &sect; 1014-A regulated core political speech and was content-based, it had to receive strict scrutiny. The State could not substitute its judgment as to how best to speak for that of speakers and listeners by requiring proof of accuracy in advance of a campaign statement. Section 1014-A attempted to protect voters from potentially misleading or inaccurate speech, the precise action that First Amendment jurisprudence prohibited. It was not narrowly tailored to serve a state interest in preventing fraud, as the unauthorized use of an endorsement was not necessarily fraudulent. Therefore, &sect; 1014-A was facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was vacated, &sect; 1014-A was stricken as unconstitutional, and the case was remanded to the trial court for remand to the Commission to strike its finding of a violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant sought a stay of the court's mandate to obtain a review of the court's opinion by the United States Supreme Court. The remaining parties, including the Secretary of the State of Maine, opposed the motion for stay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the merits, the movant had unsuccessfully challenged Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 354(2007), which mandated the voiding of an entire ballot initiative petition when the circulator's oath, although made in good faith, was later found to be inaccurate with regard to a single signature. The court noted that its mandate would normally have issued 14 days following the certification of its opinion pursuant to Me. R. App. P. 14(a)(2) but that it had held the mandate, pending receipt of each party's position on the motion to stay, which was filed simultaneously with a motion for stay with a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2101(f). The movant averred that he intended to file an expedited petition for certiorari solely to challenge whether application of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 354(7)(A), (9), violated the First Amendment. The court held that, although movant did not establish a reasonable likelihood of success in obtaining review and prevailing in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court because generally applicable and evenhanded restrictions to protect the integrity of the electoral process were routinely upheld, a one-week stay was prudent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although finding that movant was unlikely to succeed in obtaining certiorari review in the U.S. Supreme Court, the court partially accommodated movant's request for a stay of the court's mandate by granting a stay for one week. However, the court refused to grant a further stay unless the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a stay of the mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The high court held the owner's claim for damages under &sect; 3029 was entirely independent of his inverse condemnation claim; therefore, the principles of inverse condemnation were not the basis of the city's liability. Because the language of the exclusion did not clearly address coverage for claims that did not involve takings, its application to the owner's claim was ambiguous at best. As ambiguities in insurance contracts had to be resolved in favor of the insured, the trial court erred in granting the insurer summary judgment on the basis that the inverse condemnation award barred indemnification.</SPAN></P>

To have access to the child under &sect; 1653, the grandparents had to show &quot;urgent reasons&quot; justifying their standing, the same as for a petition under &sect; 1803. Rather than determining whether infringement of the mother's rights was appropriate because the grandparents were, as they claimed, the child's de facto parents, the trial court found that they had &quot;sufficient connection&quot; with the child. This was insufficient. However, the high court rejected the mother's claim that &sect; 1653(2)(B)&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringed on her parental rights. Section  1653(2)(B) could be applied constitutionally, because if the grandparents had been de facto parents, there was a compelling basis for the State's intervention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court vacated the order allowing the grandparents to intervene and remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the motion court could rely solely on the evidence already presented in determining whether the grandparents met their burden or, in its discretion, could decide to allow the parties to supplement that record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary concluded that &sect; 354(7)(A), which required voters to sign in the circulator's &quot;presence,&quot; required both &quot;physical presence&quot; and &quot;awareness,&quot; and that the circulator could not be too far away to see the voters sign their names. Accordingly, the Secretary invalidated three of the challenged signatures, each on a separate petition, because the voters signed the petitions outside the circulator's presence. The Secretary rejected the challenger's argument that the three petitions had to be entirely voided as each contained invalid signatures, that is, signatures that had not been observed by the circulator. The high court agreed with the Secretary that signatures that had not been observed by the circulator were invalid, but ruled that if even one signature on a petition was invalid for this reason, the entire petition had to be stricken. The candidate, as the circulator of the three petitions, took an oath under &sect; 354(7)(A) averring that all of the signatures were made in his presence. His oath was inaccurate, as three signatures were gathered outside of his presence. Under &sect; 354(9), as the nomination petitions did not meet the requirements of &sect; 354, they were void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A coalition appealed the judgment of the Superior Court (Franklin County, Maine) which affirmed a decision of the Land Use Regulation Commission (LURC) to authorize a company's proposed water extraction facility. The coalition argued that LURC's decision was arbitrary and unsupported by competent evidence, and that the category of permitted use under which the application was approved was unconstitutional on its face and as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company secured an option to purchase an approximately 1000 acre site that was subject to the LURC's Land Use Districts and Standards for areas within its jurisdiction. Under the LURC Rules, the site was primarily located within a general management subdistrict (M-GN) under 04-061-51 - 53 Code Me. R. &sect; 10.22 (2006). An aquifer was under the site and was the source for the drinking water. The appellate court found that the company's proposed use was permitted under Category 30 of the uses permitted in the M-GN subdistrict by the LURC Rules, 04-061-010 - 53 Code Me. R. &sect; 10.22(A)(3)(c)(30) (2006). Category 30 was not void for vagueness. The company's proposed use was consistent with the purposes of the M-GN subdistrict. The record showed that the environmental impact of the proposed use was negligible, while its impact on the creation of jobs would be positive, demonstrating a good fit with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan's goals for reasonable development, quality jobs, and natural resource protection. Such a use would fit the M-GN subdistrict well, because that subdistrict assumed that many activities could co-exist without adversely affecting each other or the forest resource.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the mother had no right to appeal because the order was entered pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 4038-C, which contained no statutory right to file an appeal. The statutory limitation did not deny her due process because she had notice of the judicial review and permanency planning hearing, was represented by counsel, and had an opportunity to rebut the Department of Health and Human Service's evidence and to present evidence. She was not deprived of her equal protection rights because the mother was not similarly situated with parents seeking to appeal an adverse ruling pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat.

The personal representative appealed and also appealed from the trial court's partial denial of her motion to dissolve its attachment order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sister-in-law and husband loaned the personal representative and her husband some money. The funds came from the sister-in-law and husband's mortgage of their Massachusetts home. The loan was memorialized by a promissory note. The personal representative's husband died having made no payments on the note and after also allegedly allowing a required life insurance policy to lapse. The sister-in-law and husband filed a breach of contract complaint. The trial court granted the sister-in-law and husband's ex parte motion for an attachment for the full amount allegedly owed. Thereafter, the trial court denied the personal representative's motion for judgment on the pleadings and reduced the attachment amount. The state supreme court found that (1) the personal representative could not show she had standing to challenge the attachment statute's constitutional validity because only a very small amount was attach and sufficient evidence did not show that the amount attached was statutorily exempt and (2) the personal representative did not show that denial of her motion for judgment on the pleadings involved either a final judgment or that an exception applied.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 13071-A(4)(A)(33) (2007) because the statute unconstitutionally violated substantive due process rights. The State of Maine appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operated was cited for violating &sect; 13071-A(4)(A)(33), which prohibited operating personalized watercraft on Lake St. George. The operator presented evidence that personalized watercraft created no greater noise or environmental dangers than other watercraft. The trial court held that the right to boat on &quot;great ponds&quot; such as Lake St. George was a &quot;fundamental right,&quot; and, applying a heightened level of scrutiny, found &sect; 13071-A(4)(A) was not an appropriate means for achieving the ends sought and was unduly arbitrary. The high court held that the public's right to use great ponds under the public trust doctrine was not &quot;fundamental.&quot; Thus, the constitutionality of &sect; 13071-A(4)(A) was presumed, and the burden was on the operator to establish that no facts existed on which a rational basis supporting the statute could be found. He did not meet his burden. Section 13071-A(4)(A) was enacted for the general welfare of the people of Maine, the means chosen were appropriate, and regulation of one form of watercraft while other forms were unregulated did not make the statute unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An alien, a noncitizen awaiting deportation, appealed after the Superior Court, Cumberland County, Maine, dismissed his Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 2121-2132 (2007), petition for postconviction review. The petition alleged ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the alien's 1998 guilty pleas to two misdemeanors that became the basis of the deportation proceedings against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A certificate of probable cause was granted on the issue of whether the jurisdictional requirement of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2124 (2006) was constitutional as it applied to the alien. The alien could not demonstrate the jurisdictional restraint or impediment required by &sect; 2124(3)(C). The pending deportation proceeding was not the functional equivalent of a pending trial as described in &sect; 2124(3)(C). It was a civil proceeding, and deportation itself was not a criminal punishment. The alien also could not demonstrate that he was subject to any of the restraints or impediments specified in &sect; 2124(1), which were all imposed by a government as a criminal punishment. The deportation action was not one in which the alien was &quot;effectively&quot; being tried for the crime of trespass. Until the deportation question was resolved, the alien's presence in the United States was lawful. Finally, the jurisdictional prerequisite in &sect; 2124 was constitutionally sound. Limiting postconviction review actions was rationally related to legitimate state interests in promoting timely resolution of criminal charges, protecting the finality of judgments, and providing closure for injured victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A humane agent for the State of Maine Animal Welfare Program (AWP) obtained a search warrant and seized an owner's animals based on an allegation that the animals were cruelly treated. Acting under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17 &sect; 1021(4) (2007), the agent obtained an ex parte order to seize the animals prior to a hearing. The animal owner appealed from a judgment of the District Court, Calais, Maine, forfeiting the owner's animals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An anonymous tip claimed that the animals were cruelly abandoned or cruelly treated within the meaning of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 4011 or Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 1031 (2007). The owner argued that (1) notice by service and filing of an ex parte order and application for the order, to initiate forfeiture proceedings, was improper procedure pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 1021 (2007), and was insufficient to constitute due process; and (2) &sect; 1021 was void for vagueness. After a two-day show cause hearing, the district court ordered the animals forfeited to the AWP, finding that the animals had been treated cruelly due to deprivation of humanely clean conditions. The owner asserted that the case was not brought correctly under the statute and that notice was flawed. The supreme judicial court held that (1) the owner had sufficient notice of the reason and time for the hearing; (2) the owner was afforded due process when she was given a full opportunity to present her case; and (3) that &sect; 1021(5-A) was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A land owner challenged a judgment of the Superior Court (Washington County, Maine) granting the town's Me. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the owner's complaint that sought a declaration that the town's residents erred in construing the town's shoreland area ordinance at a town meeting, where they unanimously voted against the owner's request to reclassify its land from strict resource protection to limited residential/recreational.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's cause of action accrued when the original zoning classification was made, and therefore the complaint was barred by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 752 (2007). Once the owner's land was originally designated as a strict resource protection tract, nothing changed objectively; the town's rejection of the owner's request to amend the ordinance merely preserved the status quo. The voters acted as the town's legislative body; in that capacity, the decision was entitled to great deference from the courts. The state legislature's requirement for the adoption of zoning regulations in shoreland areas and the town's ordinance were each presumed to be constitutional. The owner's due process claim was stale because it could have been made when the land was originally zoned. Once the six-year period of limitation expired, the time bar fell on the potential cause of action, and a claim of procedural irregularities at the town meeting, even those of constitutional import, could not resurrect it. The zoning classification was in harmony with the comprehensive plan and the statutory mandate of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38, &sect; 438-A, so no inquiry as to the voters's decision was needed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town and its residents filed a complaint against the State of Maine in the Superior Court, Cumberland County (Maine), for a declaratory judgment that 2001 Me. Laws ch. 8 and 2005 Me. Laws ch. 2, &sect; D-69 violated provisions of the Maine and United States Constitutions. The trial court determined, based upon an agreed statement of facts submitted by the parties, that both laws were constitutional. The town and its residents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maine Legislature passed legislation, 2001 Me. Laws ch. 8, which deleted the language in a bill of secession that allowed the town to later withdraw from a school administrative district in accordance with applicable state law. The legislation also provided that the town could not withdraw from the school administrative district unless the withdrawal was first authorized by further amendment. Subsequently, the Legislature passed 2005 Me. Laws ch. 2, &sect; D-69, which excepted the municipalities in the school administrative district from the new general cost-sharing formula of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &sect;&sect; 15688 and 15689 (2007). On appeal, the court found that because Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &sect; 1405 (2006), the only state law allowing for the withdrawal of a town from a school district, had been repealed, the challenge to 2001 Me. Laws ch. 8 was moot. Additionally, the challenge to 2005 Me. Laws ch. 2, &sect; D-69 pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause of Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6-A and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 failed because the town and its residents did not meet their burden of showing that there were similarly situated towns that were treated differently under the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's case arose from a series of cases against the health care providers associated with the failure of implants placed into the patients' mouths to relieve joint malfunction. At the center of the patient's case was the alleged failure to obtain the patient's informed consent. At trial, the patient proffered the expert testimony of a medical school professor. The trial court excluded his testimony. After the patient conceded that the expert was her only informed consent witness, the trial court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the health care providers. The state supreme court found that the expert's testimony was properly excluded because he would have testified from an ethics standpoint what the standard care of should be and not what it was. It then found that judgment as a matter of law was properly granted to the health care providers since nobody else could establish the standard of care. Too, the state supreme court ruled that the issue of whether Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2905(1)(A) was constitutional had not been preserved for review but that the statute adequately provided a standard of care to be applied on a case-by-case basis.</SPAN></P>

The Cumberland County Superior Court (Maine) ruled in favor of the city. The facility appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Until the city passed the SMRF ordinance, the facility had annually received licenses from the city under the Maine Junkyard and Automobile Graveyard Statute (Junkyard Statute), Me.

Ann. tit. 30-A, &sect; 3754-A(7) stated that the Junkyard Statute did not impinge on a city's home rule authority, the Junkyard Statute did not preempt the ordinance. There was no evidence that the Maine Hazardous Waste, Septage and Solid Waste Management Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38, &sect;&sect; 1301-1319-Y (2007), applied to the facility, that the city enacted stricter standards than those of Act, or that the ordinance frustrated the purposes of the Act. There was no substantive due process or equal protection violation. The ordinance bore a rational relationship to a legitimate government end, and it was not arbitrary or irrationally discriminatory. There was no &quot;taking,&quot; as the ordinance did not deprive the facility of all economically beneficial uses of the property. The facility did not prove the ordinance violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, by discriminating against interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A resident filed an action alleging that the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 1999 (SORNA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A, &sect;&sect; 11201-11256 (2006), violated the resident's constitutional rights. The Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine), dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The resident appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident was convicted and sentenced before 1986 for a sex offense he committed when he was 19 years old on a family member, and to which he pleaded guilty. The complaint stated that since the sex offense conviction, he had no arrests or convictions for sexual offenses. Pursuant to amendments to SORNA which were made retroactive, the resident was required to register as a sex offender for life. The resident argued that the requirement that information concerning his sex offender status be published on the internet gave him reason to believe that he would lose his job, and that his wife would leave him to protect her family. The state supreme court could not say that these were all things that could otherwise occur through the use of routine background checks. The state supreme court further held that the fact that a sex offender never had the ability to escape the registration requirements, regardless of behavior, consequences, or contributions following the conviction, had the capability to be excessive and diverging from the purpose of protecting the public. Thus, the state supreme court held that the resident should be given the opportunity to develop the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court, Androscoggin County (Maine), which convicted him of the Class A offenses of manslaughter and kidnapping, in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect;&sect; 203(1)(A) and 301(1)(B)(1) (2006). The trial court imposed consecutive terms of imprisonment on him pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victim had a relationship for several months, which the victim ended.

When she regained consciousness and banged on the truck to get out, he changed directions quickly, causing her to fall out onto the road. She died from her injuries. Defendant was convicted of manslaughter and kidnapping. Pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1256(2)(D) (1983 &amp; Supp. 2003), the trial court imposed consecutive sentences.

As the sentence for each individual crime did not exceed the statutory maximum under Me. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that Maine's murder sentencing statute, former Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1251, and the sentencing procedure of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1252-C, violated his Sixth Amendment right to have a jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, any facts that increased his sentence of imprisonment. Plaintiff claimed that former Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1251 created a statutory minimum sentence of 25 years for murder. The appellate court disagreed. Pursuant to former Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1251 (Supp. 1999), a person convicted of murder may have been sentenced anywhere from a minimum of 25 years to a maximum of life in prison. The factual findings made by the trial court in this case did not have the effect of increasing plaintiff's sentence beyond the maximum statutory sentence of life imprisonment for murder. Rather, the trial court, employing these factual findings, arrived at a sentence of 40 years, well within the statutory sentencing range.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prelitigation screening panel determined that while the doctor had deviated from the standard of care regarding the treatment of a fracture site wound, that deviation was not the cause of the patient's injury. During the second trial held in the case, the trial court admitted the causation finding, but not the standard of care finding, into evidence. That led to a reversal of the verdict in favor of the doctor. Both findings were admitted, over the doctor's objection, in the third trial. The doctor contended that the trial court erred in doing so. The supreme court agreed. Under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2858(2), the decision of whether to make a patient &quot;subject to&quot; the panel's negative finding on either the issue of negligence or causation was one to be made by the doctor. Neither the constitutional right to a jury trial nor the Health Security Act required the admission of the panel's findings when the panel had decided negligence in favor of the patient but causation in favor of the doctor and when the doctor objected to the admission of the findings. As the doctor opted to not subject the patient to the panel's findings, they were inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, &sect; 6913(a)(1) (2006), as it applied to a state health insurance program (the program).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association argued that the program's board of directors (the board) originally interpreted the term &quot;aggregate measurable cost savings&quot; too broadly and, as a result, the superintendent erred in reading the statute to include cost savings encompassed in the broader act within which the program was created. The supreme court first determined that &sect; 6913(1)(A) was ambiguous because the legislature created a new phrase, &quot;aggregate measurable cost savings,&quot; without providing a definition of the types of cost savings the term encompassed. Absent a definition, the statute could be reasonably interpreted to support both parties' positions regarding its meaning. In light of this ambiguity, the supreme court deferred to the board's interpretation because the board was created contemporaneously with the act, and was expressly directed to determine the aggregate measurable cost savings realized during the program's first assessment year. Moreover, absent a definitive expression of legislative intent, the board's interpretation of the phrase &quot;aggregate measurable cost savings&quot; to include savings that were realized through the broader act that created the program was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation, a vehicle manufacturer, appealed the judgment of the Kennebec County Superior Court (Maine), which affirmed a decision of defendant, the Acting Executive Director of the Maine Revenue Service, denying the corporation's request for a sales tax refund. The corporation had requested a refund of $ 50,981, the total amount of sales tax it paid to the owners of 58 vehicles the corporation either replaced or repurchased.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the corporation argued that it was entitled to a refund pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 2011 (2006), and that the interpretation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 2011 raised multiple constitutional infirmities when applied in conjunction with the Maine Lemon Law, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 1161-1169 (2006). The state supreme court concluded that the corporation was not entitled to a refund because the corporation was not a taxpayer pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 111 (2006). The corporation was not paying a tax to the State, as the definition of taxpayer required; it was reimbursing the consumer for the tax that the consumer paid to the State. In addition, the corporation was not a taxpayer's successor because there was no refund to which the corporation could succeed where the consumer-taxpayer never paid a tax more than once, nor was the consumer-taxpayer subjected to an illegal or erroneous tax. The statutory language dictated that a successor in interest could only receive a refund to which the taxpayer was entitled. Finally, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 2011 was constitutional when applied in connection with the Maine Lemon Law.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat.

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 13-A(1). Defendant argued that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 201(1-A) was unconstitutionally vague because it did not give adequate notice of what conduct was criminal and produced confusion in the jury. The supreme court disagreed, finding that the statute was not unclear or vague in any way that would render its application in defendant's case unconstitutional. Finally, defendant argued that the trial court set his basic sentence too high because the murder was not among the most egregious imaginable and fell in the low-to-medium range of seriousness. The supreme court disagreed, noting, inter alia, defendant's refusal to accept responsibility or show any empathy or remorse, perjury, pattern of escalating behavior, and violence at the Youth Center and in prison.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found, however, defendant's theory that she was an alternative suspect was wholly speculative. There was no evidence that the witness had any recent experience with knives or suggesting that the witness could have been responsible for the stabbing of her brother. This line of questioning was not relevant. There was no evidence showing that the witness lied when she denied carrying a knife at the time of the victim's death. As the trial court properly concluded, the defense sought to use the Department of Health and Human Services records to suggest that because the witness had carried a knife four years in the past, she may have been carrying a knife at the time of the victim's death. This line of questioning was also not relevant because there was no evidence linking the victim to the stabbing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father allegedly shook the child, resulting in brain injury. Doctors asked for a do not resuscitate directive. The parents refused to consent. The trial court then entered a finding under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 4037 that authorized the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to make all medical decisions, including a decision to approve a do not resuscitate directive. In the &sect; 4037 proceeding, the preponderance of the evidence standard applied. The reviewing court found that, because a do not resuscitate directive could have resulted in termination of parental rights, due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6-A required that the clear and convincing evidence standard of parental termination proceedings apply. The reviewing court found that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 4037 did not grant the Department the right to unilaterally approve a do not resuscitate directive except after notice to the parents and, if they object, a right for them to be heard. In the case at issue, the hearing on the do not resuscitate directive was inadequate because no testimony was given at the hearing and no findings were made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated insofar as the trial court permitted the Department to approve a do not resuscitate directive without a hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant intervenor challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine), which vacated a decision of appellee Maine Secretary of State that an initiative petition was supported by the timely filing of a sufficient number of valid signatures. The court held that, under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, &sect; 903-A (2005), the Secretary erred in accepting petitions that were filed one year and three days after the petition was issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plain language of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, &sect; 903-A(1) established a filing deadline one year after the date of issuance. Neither the Maine Constitution nor the statutes explicitly provided the Secretary with the authority to extend those very specific time frames. The court found that the one-year-from-issuance deadline established by &sect; 903-A was inconsistent with both the Maine Constitution and statutory provisions on point where, while the Legislature might have had the authority to set reasonable limits on the time allowed for circulating and filing petitions, the one-year limit set by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, &sect; 903-A was inconsistent with Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, &sect; 18 and conflicted with statutory provisions acknowledging &sect; 18. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, &sect; 903-A(1) was facially inconsistent with the Constitution because it denied initiative proponents the flexibility allowed by the Constitution to circulate their petitions, to choose a filing date, and to file up to the dates set out in Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, &sect; 18. Because the one-year statutory deadline was invalid, the Secretary did not err in accepting the late petitions filed by the intervenor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disciplinary action stemmed from a complaint filed by the parents of two children the LPC was counseling.

The supreme court affirmed, holding that 1) the language of Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, &sect; 13858 was clear and unambiguous; 2) &sect; 13858 limited the authority to diagnose and treat mental health disorders to licensees with clinical status; 3) LPCs did not have clinical status, and therefore, the LPC had no authority to diagnose mental health disorders; 4) interpretation of &sect; 13858 was part of the Board's adjudicative responsibility during the LPC's hearing, and therefore, the Board was not required to engage in formal rulemaking before its interpretation of the statute could be applied to the LPC; and 5) the statutory scheme regulating LPCs was not void for vagueness as it specifically stated that only counselors holding clinical status were authorized to diagnose and treat, and LPCs did not have clinical status.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &sect; 2951(2) (2005). The trial court dismissed the town defendants and granted summary judgment to the State. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &sect; 2951(2) (2005) in an attempt to comply with the requirements of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The court upheld a constitutional challenge to the statute's exclusion of religious schools from state funding. The United States Supreme Court later issued an opinion upholding a state's public tuition subsidies to students to attend sectarian educational institutions under certain circumstances. The parents then filed an action challenging &sect; 2951(2) in light of the new high court precedent. The trial court held &sect; 2951(2) to be constitutional. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 2951(2) did not improperly infringe on the free exercise of religion because it merely prohibited the State from funding the parents' school choice, and as such, it did not burden or inhibit religion in a constitutionally significant manner. The court also held that &sect; 2951(2) did not violate equal protection because the State's concern to avoid excessive entanglements between government and religion provided a rational basis to maintain the statute's funding limitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an injured patient and his wife, appealed from a judgment entered in the Superior Court (Hancock County, Maine) in favor of defendant doctor following a jury trial on a complaint for medical malpractice. The patient and his wife contended that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2857 (2005) was unconstitutional because it violated their right to a jury trial guaranteed by Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor treated the patient for an open fracture of his ankle. The fracture did not heal correctly. Prior to the trial, a prelitigation screening panel had unanimously determined that the doctor deviated from the applicable standard of medical care and that the deviation did not cause the patient's injury. Pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2857(1), the court allowed in evidence the panel's finding favorable to the doctor but refused to allow in evidence the panel's findings favorable to the patient. The appellate court held the partial admission reduced the strength and persuasiveness of the patient's case to the jury and, at the same time, strengthened the doctor's case, thereby significantly infringing upon the patient's right to have facts determined by a jury. The panel's finding that the doctor was negligent was necessary to put into context its finding that the doctor's acts were not the proximate cause of the injuries. The application of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect;&sect; 2857(1)(B) and (C) was unconstitutional and denied the patient's right to a jury trial under Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents sought visitation when their son died, over the mother's objection. The supreme court held Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, &sect; 1803(1)(A) (1998) violated federal substantive due process as applied to the mother. Strict scrutiny applied as making her litigate the claim, that could infringe a fundamental right to her child's care, infringed the right. Section 1803(1)(A) did not let a court decide if urgent reasons justified imposing this litigation burden on the mother, when seeking visitation due to the child's father's death. The death did not justify this per se rule. It was no urgent reason to interfere in family life over the mother's objection as it did not affect her right to decide her child's contact with the grandparents. A state interest in keeping a child's connections with a deceased parent's family was not so compelling to recognize it in every case. The trial court did not decide the grandparents' request for time to file financial affidavits opposing the mother's motion for attorney's fees and costs and then granted the motion. The parties had to have a chance to file affidavits and for a hearing under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, &sect; 105(1) (2005).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of the victim's murder because (1) she died from injuries that occurred during a period of time when defendant was with her and during an altercation with him; (2) he stated that he had tried to hurt her; and (3) the jury could have inferred that the hammer was the instrument that caused the victim's head injury and that he used the hammer to hit her on the head. Also, the alternative theories of committing murder, through either intentionally or knowingly causing the death of another or by engaging in conduct that manifested a depraved indifference to the value of human life and that in fact caused the death of another, were permissible alternatives and not separate offenses. Thus, the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Maine Constitutions did not require the jury to settle unanimously on one of the alternatives. Therefore, the trial court did not commit error in failing to instruct the jury that it had to unanimously agree on one of the alternative theories of committing murder. Finally, based on the violation of defendant's bail condition that he not have contact with the victim, a sentence of 37 years was not illegal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3026 (1992), the city discontinued two public roads, both of which terminated at the boundary of the landowner's property. The city did not award the landowner any damages for the discontinuances. The trial court determined that the landowner had suffered neither a physical nor a regulatory taking as a result of the city's discontinuance of the roads. The parties proceeded to trial on the landowner's claims brought pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3029. The appellate court declined to import a constitutional takings analysis into Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3026 because such a construction would be contrary to the letter and spirit of &sect; 3026. The language and context of &sect; 3026 indicated that an action for damages pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3029 was not limited to cases in which there had been a taking of constitutional dimensions. Also, the trial court committed no error in limiting the time frame for mitigation of damages to the relevant period of immediately before and after the discontinuances.</SPAN></P>

After another argument with the girlfriend, defendant dropped the cat carrier out of the truck's window and began to drive away. While maneuvering around another car, defendant ran over the cat carrier and killed the cat. The supreme judicial court held that defendant was not left to guess whether his conduct violated &sect; 1031(1-B). He needed only to ask himself whether a reasonable person would find his conduct to be morally debased, posing a high degree of risk, and manifesting a total lack of concern for the cat's death or suffering.

Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 203(1)(A) (Supp. 2000). The Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine), sentenced her to a prison term of 28 years, with all but 20 years suspended, to be followed by six years of probation. Defendant appealed her sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's five-year-old foster child would go into rages and would scream uncontrollably. Defendant secured the child to a high chair with duct tape, wrapped duct tape around her mouth and head, and left her alone. The child died of asphyxia. The trial court found that, as the crime was among the most heinous crimes committed against a person, a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum of 20 years was appropriate under former Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1252(2)(A) (Supp. 2001). The high court held that defendant's waiver of a jury in the guilt phase did not apply to the sentencing phase. As Blakely was decided after defendant was sentenced, her unpreserved Blakely claim was reviewable as plain error. Former &sect; 1252(2)(A) could not be constitutionally applied without affording defendant an opportunity to have the fact-finder of her choice, judge or jury, determine whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the crime was among the most heinous offenses committed against a person. On remand, if the State sought a sentence in excess of 20 years, or the trial court was inclined to impose such a sentence, defendant was entitled to have a jury decide the heinousness issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a complaint against his childhood priest and the Diocese for punitive damages after he was allegedly sexually abused by the priest as a child. The supreme court found that if a religious organization knew or had reason to know that a member of its clergy had a propensity to sexually abuse children, the First Amendment and Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 were not necessarily violated if the civil law imposed on the organization a duty to exercise due care to protect children with whom the organization had a fiduciary relationship, consistent with Restatement (Second) of Torts &sect;&sect; 315(b) and 317. Under the facts alleged, the risk of harm posed by a priest to a child with whom the Diocese had a fiduciary relationship was &quot;reasonably to be perceived within the range of apprehension&quot; and created a duty on the part of the Diocese to act. Plaintiff's claim that the Diocese learned of the priest's propensity for sexual exploitation and abuse but failed to report him to law enforcement officials and then concealed the information from parishioners and the public stated a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

The Department found that the dock did not meet NRPA requirements in two respects: it would unreasonably interfere with existing scenic uses, and it would unreasonably harm significant marine aquatic habitat. The superior court affirmed. On appeal, the court found that the record supported the Department's findings that the proposed dock would result in the loss of coastal wetland area, functions, and values, a loss of marine aquatic life and habitat, and that the owner had alternatives that would meet the project purpose making the impacts unnecessary and unreasonable. The court noted that although the owner failed to provide information regarding alternatives, as required by Code Me. R. 06 096 310-7 &sect; 9(A), the Department found that he had dock space and a mooring at the town landing for his large boat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All but two developers had previously sued the town regarding applications for development projects, but they did not challenge the impact fees, and they did not appeal summary judgment for the town. The trial court found res judicata barred the current suit, except as to one developer. The supreme court held challenges to municipal administrative acts had to be brought within thirty days of the act or failure to act, under Me. R. Civ. P. 80B(b), and the conditional approvals were not challenged within that period. When the time to appeal expired, the conditional approvals, including the impact fee requirements, became final and were not subject to challenge. The developers could not use a declaratory judgment action to avoid that. A governmental action could be challenged at any time, when the action was beyond an administrative body's authority, but the town's planning board had the authority to condition subdivision approval. The declaratory judgment law did not permit anticipatory challenges to the town's ordinance, which had been amended to comply with Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30-A, &sect; 4354 (Supp. 2004).</SPAN></P>

The sister claimed that respondent suffered from a mental illness, was at risk of physical harm because of her behavior, and was unable to manage her property and affairs.

The appellate court held that a court-appointed psychiatric examination did not violate respondent's liberty interest in being free from unwanted medical treatment. The evaluation that occurred consisted of two interviews lasting a total of six hours. No invasive procedures were performed. Respondent was free to not answer the questions. Respondent also argued that the trial court erred in not holding an evidentiary hearing prior to entering its orders. The appellate court held that requiring an evidentiary hearing would create additional cost without a corresponding benefit. Me. R. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted on appeal that the State did not demonstrate that he possessed the requisite criminal intent, that the trial court did not sufficiently respond to his request for findings of fact, and that the statutes under which he was prosecuted were void for vagueness. Defendant conceded that he was domiciled in the State of Maine in the relevant tax years and that he did not file tax returns or pay income taxes. Defendant urged that the State failed to carry its burden of proving that he acted with the intent to violate the tax laws, asserting that there was a difference between the legal activity of intentionally avoiding taxes and the illegal activity of intentionally evading taxes. The court determined that the State demonstrated that defendant consciously chose to violate a known legal duty to pay taxes and file returns as well as negated defendant's claim that he misunderstood the law. The court further found that the trial court's findings of fact were adequate, because they addressed the issue of intent to establish domicile and the intent to evade.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Washington County Superior Court (Maine) concluded that neither appellant property owners nor appellee neighbors held title to a disputed piece of land and entered summary judgment. The property owners appealed the grant of summary judgment with respect to their claim for declaratory judgment and trespass. The neighbors appealed the grant of summary judgment with respect to their claim for title by acquiescence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the property owners argued that the trial court erred by failing to apply the tax lien statute of limitations provisions set forth in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 946-A (Supp. 2003). The neighbors argued that a genuine issue of material fact existed relating to their claim of title by acquiescence. The state supreme court found that the 1948 conveyance from one previous owner to another left the previous owner with a separate lot that was erroneously swept up into the 1951 foreclosure on the property. Because the 1951 tax lien certificate was void as to the westerly portion of the lot at issue, the State never obtained title to that land and did not acquire the ability to convey it in 1954. Thus, all subsequent conveyances of the westerly portion of the lot, including the conveyance to the property owners, were ineffective, and the trial court correctly found that the property owners could not establish title to the westerly portion of the lot. Because neither of the parties owned the disputed parcel, neither the neighbors' claim of title by acquiescence against the property owners, nor the property owners' claim of trespass against the neighbors, could prevail.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant bank appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Androscoggin County (Maine), which held the bank liable as trustee for attached proceeds. The bank appealed from the denial of its motions, and challenged the constitutionality and application of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 2614 (2003). Plaintiff former officer filed a cross-appeal of the trial court's determination that he was only entitled to a portion of a severance amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former officer was entitled to payments under a severance agreement, which was then breached. The officer filed an action against his former company, as well as a motion for attachment and trustee process (ATP). The motion was granted, and the bank was served with a trustee summons. The bank failed to file the required disclosure statement, and the clerk entered a default. Thereafter, the bank filed the necessary papers, but the trial court did not grant the bank's motions to dissolve or modify the ATP, nor did it vacate the clerk's default. The trial court allowed the bank to intervene at the damages phase, and judgment was entered for the officer. On appeal, the court found that the bank could not challenge the underlying attachment order pursuant to Me. R. Civ. P. 4B(i), as it was a defaulted party and should have first sought relief from the default. The bank failed to show good cause to set aside the default pursuant to Me. R. Civ. P. 55(c). As the bank had sufficient notice, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 2614 did not impose a grossly excessive and unconstitutional fine, and it was clear by the severance agreement language that the acceleration clause was not triggered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to several close primary elections, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court was asked to resolve disputes over certain ballots.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was a dispute regarding certain ballots in several close primary races. The court was asked to resolve the disputes. It determined that Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, &sect; 3 did not vest exclusive authority in the Maine Legislature over legislative primary recount appeals. Therefore, the court was not prevented from exercising jurisdiction over the case. Further, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, &sect; 737-A(10) (Supp. 2003) was ambiguous based on the phrase &quot;any election.&quot; As such, the court examined the legislative history of &sect; 737-A(10). After conducting such an analysis, the court concluded that the Maine Legislature intended to give the judicial branch jurisdiction over recount appeals in primary elections. Voters were given instructions for marking ballots in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, &sect; 691 (Supp. 2003). If a vote was invalid under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 21-A, &sect; 696 (Supp. 2003), then the court was not required to analyze the voter's intent. The court reviewed three elections, attempting to discern the voter's intent on several ballots. Several votes were judged invalid under &sect; 696. The court was able to render a decision in all of the elections after reviewing the ballots.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the winner in two elections, and it found that a write-in candidate did not receive enough votes for a nomination.</SPAN></P>

Various citizens challenged the constitutionality of the scheme, and the high court held that most of them (the challengers who owned property, as opposed to renting) had standing. It proceeded to hold the scheme invalid, because it had been undertaken by the city without authorization by the state legislature. Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 9 made it clear that the legislature controlled taxing powers. In certain time-honored circumstances, that power even allowed the legislature to authorize exemptions from taxation that would otherwise have been forbidden by Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8, which prescribed equal apportionment of taxation. There had been no authorization for the local legislation in question, however.

The employee petitioned for restoration, contending that because she had lost her employment, her economic circumstances had changed since the 2000 decree, and she was entitled to a new determination of benefits. While her petition was pending, the legislature enacted Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39-A, &sect; 224 (Supp. 2002), mandating a new calculation method. Because its language made clear that &sect; 224 applied to pending petitions, her petition for restoration, pending at the time &sect; 224 became effective, was governed by that provision.

There was no reason that the taxpayer could not prove discrimination by showing that the neighboring lots were assessed at drastically lower valuations, that there were no distinctions between the properties that justified the disparity, and that any rationale offered by the town for the lower valuation was unfounded or arbitrary. In addition, the board misunderstood the legal remedy for unjust discrimination because an abatement was a proper remedy for unjust discrimination in a property tax assessment case. Also, the board's limited findings were insufficient to explain its decision to deny the taxpayer's abatement requests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a mobile home park owner and his corporation, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, York County (Maine), which denied their request for attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. Specifically, the trial court concluded that even if appellants were to be considered prevailing parties for purposes of an award of attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, special circumstances existed warranting a denial of those fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellants argued that they were prevailing parties pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 and were entitled to attorney fees because no special circumstances existed to justify the denial of an award. The state supreme court concluded that appellants were prevailing parties because they satisfied all three requirements of the relevant test. First, the parties' legal relationship was materially altered by the trial court's holding that a town ordinance was invalid insofar as it prohibited the reasonable consideration of expansion of existing mobile home parks. Second, the state and federal claims shared a common nucleus of operative facts--the ordinance's prohibition of the expansion of mobile home parks. Third, appellants' efforts to challenge a discriminatory ordinance presented a substantial, although not dispositive, federal claim, and the protection from discrimination provided the essential legal interconnection between the state and federal claims. In addition, the sole fact that the meritorious claim of discrimination arose in the context of a zoning dispute was insufficient to constitute a special circumstances exception to the award of fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Maine Committee on Judicial Responsibility and Disability reported findings that respondent probate judge had violated Me. Code Jud. Conduct Canons 5(A)(3) and 5(A)(1)(e) in the course of an unsuccessful state senate campaign, and recommended imposition of appropriate discipline. The judge challenged the constitutionality of the canons as applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Various parts of Me. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 5 put strict limits on political activity by probate judges, although, as the only elected judges in Maine's system, they were permitted to engage in certain political activities when they were up for re-election. When he decided to run for state senate, the judge in question did not resign. He did not solicit funds extensively, but did personally solicit just enough small contributions to qualify for public funding of his campaign. The court agreed that this conduct violated the canon. Separation of powers principles made explicit at Me. Const. art. III made the court responsible for setting standards of judicial conduct, so to the extent that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &sect; 312 (Supp. 2002) appeared to allow the judge to engage in conduct forbidden by the canon, it was unconstitutional. The canon also did not unconstitutionally limit the judge's free speech rights, because of the compelling state interest in judicial impartiality. It simply offered him a choice between remaining a probate judge and running a campaign for state senate. Since the judge tested the canon in good faith, there was no reason to impose a sanction on him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trustee filed an application with Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), seeking permission to construct a 90-foot dock from a 62-acre parcel of property which was owned by a trust, into a cove that bordered the property. The DEP recommended that Maine's Board of Environmental Protection assume jurisdiction over the application, and the Board denied the application. The state supreme court held that the Board's decision had to be reversed because it was based on conclusions that were not supported by evidence in the record; namely, that approving the trustee's application would set a precedent which allowed other people to build docks, and that the cumulative impact of increased boat traffic generated by the trustee's dock and other docks which would likely follow could, at some time in the future, have an adverse impact on the marine environment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after an officer observed defendant squealing tires while driving his motor vehicle on a paved roadway that extended around the perimeter of the fairgrounds racetrack. Defendant's operating license had been suspended. The fairgrounds were private, but the public was invited onto the fairgrounds for events. The public used the perimeter roadway to access events in the fairgrounds. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in finding that the area in which he was operating his vehicle was a parking area as defined by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29-A, &sect; 101(51) (1996). He also asserted that the definition of parking area in &sect; 101(51) was vague. Because the perimeter roadway was designed for public use, defendant was prohibited from operating a vehicle on the perimeter roadway, as the roadway was a parking area as defined under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29-A, &sect; 101(51). The term parking area in &sect; 101(51) was not vague. Parking area was clearly delineated from a private way under Me. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two challenges to a reapportionment plan were filed. &quot;Portland&quot; challengers challenged the plan's composition of the Portland, Maine, area districts. The &quot;District 36&quot; challenger was challenging the composition of District 36, comprising several towns and islands in two counties. The Department of the Attorney General, the Maine Democratic Party, the Speaker of the House, and the House Republican Party Leader asserted the plan was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Challengers to a reapportionment plan presented state-law based challenges to the plan based on Me. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, pt. 1. A challenge that the plan maximized representation of voters in a Democratic Party stronghold by ensuring that current Democratic incumbents resided in separate districts and by placing a &quot;jog&quot; in a boundary line did not rise to the level of a constitutional or statutory violation. There was not discrimination against an identifiable political group. Although residences on islands presented transportation challenges, the choice of connecting the islands by district to one peninsula rather than the other was not irrational. There was no indication that the plan hindered access to meaningful representation. The District 36 challenger claimed the district was not compact. While the island district posed transportation challenges for its representative, those challenges were within what was constitutionally permissible under the state compactness-and-contiguity test when the special nature of islands was considered. The challengers failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality that precedent required the court to attach to the redistricting plan.</SPAN></P>

The DHS also imposed a financial penalty against the operators for having provided assisted living services to more than two residents without a license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 7801(1)(A), (3) (Supp. 2002). The DHS issued an immediate cease and desist order, which was eventually complied with. In the interim, the operators applied for two types of residential care facility licenses, both of which were denied. Thereafter, a new application for an AFCH license was filed, which was again denied by the DHS based on its finding that the operators did not have a record of honest and lawful conduct. In a separate administrative matter, the DHS fined the operators upon discovery that they had provided prohibited assisted living care services. On appeal, the trial court affirmed those decisions, and the operators sought further review. The court found that the standard of &quot;honest and lawful conduct&quot; was not a legislative delegation of authority, nor was it impermissibly vague. Additionally, the court found that the operators had violated DHS rules by providing unlicensed services, and the fact that one of the residents slept in a recreational vehicle did not change the fact of the violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with assault and was convicted. He appealed his conviction and sentence. The court noted that defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial was voluntary. The record revealed that he was made aware of his jury trial right through an arraignment tape and by the trial judge personally, and that he did not file his late request for a jury until nearly two months after the arraignment. Accordingly, there was no error in the denial of his late jury request. The court indicated that alleged errors which were not preserved for appeal and did not constitute an &quot;obvious error&quot; were not reviewable. The court found that the period of probation was a cognizable challenge because defendant's dispute involved the legality, rather than the propriety thereof. The court held that a period of probation was a &quot;sentence&quot; within Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1201(2) (Supp. 2002), and therefore, the strictures of Apprendi applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parents separated, and the mother obtained a protective order against the father, the mother denied the paternal grandmother access to the three grandchildren. The high court, after noting with regret that the issue of standing under Me. Rev. Stat.

The grandmother in the instant case had a more conventional relationship with her grandchildren, and it simply did rise to the level of urgency required for standing.

The owner argued that the city failed to prove that it presented nude entertainment, as the police officer who testified could not state the specific names or descriptions of the dancers he observed. This argument was rejected, as the evidence included the owner's admission that the dancers exposed their buttocks and breasts. As to constitutionality, the appellate court found that the ordinance at issue was enacted within the city's police power. It furthered the important government interest of controlling the issuance of special amusement permits for music, dancing, and entertainment for liquor licensees, and prevented the harmful secondary effects associated with nude entertainment. It was content neutral, and the incidental restriction on speech was no greater than was necessary to achieve the government's purpose. It provided reasonable alternative avenues for expression, and it was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

That action was dismissed pending resolution of state-based ownership issues. After the town seceded from the city, the owner again filed the action in federal court, this time against the town. The action was dismissed on grounds of res judicata. Thereafter, the owner commenced the state court action seeking to quiet title to the streets and the submerged lands, and to recover for the alleged unconstitutional takings of his property. The town's motion to dismiss was granted as to the quiet title claim over the streets and the damages thereunder, and denied as to those claims with respect to the submerged lands. Both parties appealed and the court dismissed both appeals, holding that the orders were interlocutory and not properly appealable. The judicial economy exception to allow review of interlocutory orders was not applicable because there were no unique circumstances and no substantial rights of the parties that justified it.</SPAN></P>

The psychiatrist related that defendant's PTSD was severe and opined that jail could trigger his symptoms and make him a danger to himself and others. The supreme court held that the fact that the sentence imposed on defendant was harsher and had longer detrimental effects on him than on an ordinary person did not mean that the sentence as applied to him was disproportionate or offended prevailing notions of decency. Without evidence or information as to how the sheriff intended to manage defendant's sentence, the trial court was unable to determine that defendant's condition could not be accommodated, and, thus, was unable to find that applying the mandatory minimum jail sentence to defendant could result in an unconstitutionally excessive sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an undercover operation, defendants, both licensed guides, accompanied a game warden, a lodge owner, and others while hunting. The lodge owner acted as the official guide. The group members kept in radio contact, and the first defendant directed the hunting activities to flush out the deer. When the warden killed an antlerless deer in the wrong district, the deer was dragged to a road before tagging, and the second defendant drove it to the correct district. The supreme judicial court held that &sect; 7458(10) was not unconstitutionally vague since it informed defendants that directing the hunting activities to flush out the deer was illegal. Although the warden might have created the opportunity for the second defendant to illegally transport the deer, more was required for an entrapment defense. There was sufficient evidence that the first defendant was guilty of violating Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 7371-A(1) (1994) by knowingly assisting clients to violate the fish and game laws. However, the second defendant was only employed as a truck driver; therefore, the evidence was insufficient to find that he met the definition of a guide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The member argued that the trial court erred in finding that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &sect; 1002(4) (Supp. 2001), which prohibited the member's service on the committee while another school within the same school union employed his spouse, did not violate his and the voters' constitutional rights. Analyzing the statute within the Anderson framework, the injury to the member's and the voters' rights was minimal, the state's interest in maintaining public confidence in elected officials by eliminating conflicts of interest was significant, and no less restrictive alternatives would resolve the conflict of interest presented. Thus, the statute survived the member's First Amendment challenge. With respect to the member's Fourteenth Amendment challenge, the appellate court held the statute did not burden a suspect class or fundamental right, and the statute was rationally related to the legitimate public interest of preventing conflicts of interest and maintaining public trust in elected officials. It was neither overly broad nor underinclusive, and drew a rational distinction between spouses, whose finances were typically interdependent, and other family members or colleagues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the harassment statute was void for vagueness, as it did not define &quot;course of conduct,&quot; and that, strictly construed, the enhanced charging provision in the stalking statute, former Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 210-A(3), precluded the application of the general statute providing for enhanced charges for repeat offenders, former Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1252(4-A). The state supreme court concluded that there was no inconsistency between the two code sections. The extra enhanced charging provisions in the stalking statute pertained to domestic violence related offenses that were, with the exception of stalking, found outside the criminal code and were in addition to those found in the general enhanced charging statute that addressed prior criminal convictions. In addition, defendant failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that there was no reasonable interpretation of the harassment statute that satisfied constitutional requirements. Defendant called the complainant at least twice after receiving the protection from harassment order, which was sufficient for a &quot;course of conduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant transportation department acquired 1.4 acres of land from plaintiff landowner by eminent domain for continued use as a parking lot. The landowner appealed the judgments of the Cumberland County Superior Court (Maine), which granted partial summary judgment to the department on the issue of the department's authority to take the land and concluded that the public use clause of Me.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the landowner contended that the department exceeded its legislative authority, and that the taking was for a private use, in violation of Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The state supreme court concluded that, in enacting Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 153-B(1)(G) (Supp. 2001), the legislature intended to allow the use of eminent domain, in accordance with other statutorily authorized &quot;purposes,&quot; and not to require specific legislative enactments for non-highway projects on a case-by-case basis. Section 153-B(1)(G) was a general authorization, delegated from the legislature to the department, to take the property that was necessary to achieve the State's transportation policies. In addition, giving priority parking to year-round residents of the island did not render the use private. The island residents constituted a community. They were not a particular, identifiable group of individuals distinct from the public. Granting the year-round residents priority in the use of the small parking lot that served the island did not make the use private. Finally, the lot was taken to support a transportation system that was open to all members of the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner held a valid license from the town to operate a kennel. She had 16 dogs on her property. After the town received several complaints about the dogs' noise, it sent a notice to the owner. When the continual barking was not corrected, the town filed a civil action. The state supreme court held that the ordinance was not invalid in toto and therefore incapable of any valid application. The ordinance was capable of being interpreted so as to overcome its infirmities by importing a reasonable person standard into its language. Therefore, the ordinance meant that continuous or repeated dog barking that was unnecessary was actionable only if it was unreasonable. The ordinance recognized the occasional necessity of &quot;continued or repeated&quot; dog barking and howling that could disturb a reasonable person.

The supreme judicial court held that the mother did not have standing to bring her First Amendment claims. The court also held that the language of the statute was inconsistent with the mother's interpretation. The court found that the statute clearly stated the presumption that proceedings would be closed absent extraordinary circumstances. In addition, the court noted that its conclusion was consistent with federal law. Finally, the court concluded that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Between the time the defendant committed his offense and September 2000, when he was convicted, the State of Maine enacted SORNA. SORNA expanded the sex offender registration requirements in effect before the defendant committed his offense by adding additional offenses to the list of offenses which required registration, and unlawful sexual contact with a child was one of the offenses added. In imposing sentence, the trial court ordered the defendant to comply with the registration provisions of SORNA. The state supreme court held that (1) the trial court did not violate the defendant's rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution or the state constitution by requiring the defendant to register as a sex offender, pursuant to SORNA; and (2) although the trial court should have designated the defendant as a sexually violent predator, and not a sex offender, the trial court's failure to specifically make that determination was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, the Superior Court of Hancock County (Maine) entered a judgment convicting defendant of, among other things, attempted murder, pursuant to former Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 152(4) (Supp. 2000) (repealed and replaced by 2001 Me. Laws ch. 413, &sect; 1), and sentencing him to a total effective sentence of 40 years in prison. Defendant filed a direct appeal from the judgment, challenging the legality of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose out of a single incident in which he shot a law enforcement officer (LEO) twice in the chest at very close range. During the sentencing stage, the State sought the imposition of a life imprisonment sentence pursuant to the enhanced sentencing provisions of former Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 152(4) (Supp. 2000) (repealed and replaced by 2001 Me. Laws ch. 413, &sect; 1). The trial court considered the fact that the attempted murder was committed against a LEO and sentenced defendant to what it characterized as probably a de facto life sentence. On appeal, the state supreme court conducted an Apprendi analysis and concluded that the trial court committed an error when it did not instruct the jury to determine whether defendant attempted to murder a LEO. However, because no rational jury could have concluded otherwise, i.e., that the attempted murder was not committed against a LEO, the omission of the instruction did not affect defendant's substantial rights. Therefore, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city placed granite blocks and a culvert on the property to control erosion and limit storm damage. The landowners claimed the blocks limited their shorefront access and emitted noxious odors that resulted from decaying material becoming lodged in the blocks. The landowners opposed the city's summary judgment motion and filed their own motion for summary judgment supported by affidavits and a detailed statement of material facts with appropriate record references. The appellate court held that a genuine issue of material fact remained on whether the trespass was a continuing trespass or a permanent trespass. The answer to this issue would determine whether the trespass claim was barred by statute of limitations. The appellate court held it could consider only the facts contained in the landowners' statement of material facts because those facts were not contested, and were the only facts supported by appropriate record references. Nothing in that statement established, without dispute, that the trespass in question was permanent because of any intended permanency of the alterations or anticipated value to the public, or because the circumstances reflected a taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power company filed an alternate rate plan in 2000. The 2000 plan included eight service indicators that the power company was required to satisfy, or pay hefty fines for failure to do so. The public utilities commission (PUC), after considering all proposals and testimony, received a stipulation incorporating many of the PUC's recommendations. The PUC allowed objections, and the consumer protection group objected to the stipulation. Nonetheless, the stipulation was approved. On appeal, the consumer group argued that approval of the stipulation violated the statutory requirement that rates be just and reasonable and that the only just and reasonable way to determine the rates was by way of the power company's rate of return. The reviewing court found that the PUC was permitted to contemplate other issues in addition to rate of return when determining whether a rate was just and reasonable. Hence, the 2000 plan, providing the service indicators and a formula for predicting distribution costs over a seven year period was just and reasonable. The PUC did not exceed its authority in implementing the 2000 plan.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged a probate court's orders granting them temporary and then permanent guardianship pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 207. The high court affirmed the orders. The evidence was compelling that the daughter fled an intolerable situation. Given appellant's and her family's constant moves among jurisdictions, Maine could properly exercise jurisdiction, given the child's significant ties with Maine, under both the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738A, and Maine's enactment of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect;&sect; 1731-1781. A guardianship was not irrevocable; appellant still had various procedural avenues for challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment. Jurisdiction was proper under applicable federal and state statutes and appellant had plenty of procedural ways to challenge a guardianship order. The evidence was ample that conditions calling for guardianship existed, and appellant's daughter, as an older child, properly nominated her choices as guardians.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant grandmother requested that her grandson be removed from a foster home and placed in appellant's home. The District Court, Portland (Maine), denied the request. Appellant challenged the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that she had a fundamental liberty interest in having her grandson placed with her pursuant to the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, Me. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6-A, and that the trial court should have awarded her custody unless the court found that to do so would have placed the child in jeopardy, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 4002(6) (1992). Instead, the court applied the best interests of the child standard, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 4005-B(4) (Supp. 2000). The appellate court held that a grandparent possessed no constitutional right of access to a child. Therefore, appellant lacked a fundamental liberty interest in challenging the constitutionality of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 4005-B(4), which stated that grandparents had priority for consideration for placement if that placement was in the best interests of the child. Therefore, the appellate court held that the best interests of the child standard was constitutional when applied to a grandparent after a finding that the child is in jeopardy with his parents. The appellate court also held that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 4005-B(4) did not deprive appellant of due process.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 11008 (1989) and Me. R. Civ. P. 80C, in Superior Court, Penobscot County (Maine). Plaintiff's petition was dismissed on ground that her attorney, who was with Office of Advocacy within Maine Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation, and Substance Abuse Services, was not authorized to represent her in court. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was involuntarily committed to defendant institution. She suffered from phenylketonuria, and thus was prescribed a restrictive diet. She objected to the diet and filed a grievance with defendant alleging her right to refuse the diet. They eventually settled, and as part of the settlement, defendant was to train its employees. Plaintiff asked for verification of the training. Defendant refused, and plaintiff filed her petition. In seeking to disqualify plaintiff's attorney, defendant should have filed a motion to disqualify the attorney, not a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. If the motion to disqualify was granted, plaintiff's petition would have survived the disqualification. It was inefficient for courts to deal with the scope of representation of an attorney or the eligibility of a client as a collateral issue in individual cases. It was also an invitation to opposing parties to thwart the access to the courts by clients such as plaintiff. Questions concerning plaintiff's eligibility for representation by the Office of Advocacy should not have been reached by the trial court in the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, board members, were volunteer members of the General and Executive Boards of the Lincoln County Planning Office (LCPO). The Executive Board hired plaintiff as LCPO's executive director. Plaintiff was terminated retroactively, appealed, was ordered reinstated, and was awarded back pay from dismissal to reinstatement. The Executive Board reinstated plaintiff with less responsibilities, who then sued under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV violations among other things. Plaintiff was suspended with pay and the General Board dissolved LCPO for financial reasons. Plaintiff added defendants, board members, to his complaint. The trial court denied defendants summary judgment based on qualified immunity. The court reversed and remanded for entry of such judgment. Plaintiff had received full procedural due process for the events concerning which he was reinstated. Plaintiff had no right to return to his original specific job duties, nor were his due process rights implicated by suspension with pay.

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, &sect;&sect; 1801-1805 (1998), violated Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grandparents sued defendant parents for visits with their grandchildren, two of whom plaintiffs had provided with years of parental care, while defendant mother, plaintiffs' daughter, moved in and out of plaintiffs' home between relationships with the children's fathers. The district court found for defendants, holding that the Grandparents Visitation Act (Act), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, &sect;&sect; 1801-1805 (1998), violated the U.S. Const. amend. XIV by not requiring a showing of harm to a child as a prerequisite. The court vacated the judgment, addressing a question of first impression, the constitutionality of the Act, and finding it constitutional. Cessation of contact with a grandparent whom a child viewed as a parent could have had a dramatic, even traumatic, effect on the child, giving the State a compelling interest in providing grandparents with such a relationship with a forum to seek contact, holding Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19-A, &sect; 1803(1) (B), which required a &quot;sufficient existing relationship&quot; between grandparent and child, could have been applied in a manner consistent with the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was vacated, as grandparents visitation statute was narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interest of addressing children's relationship with people who had cared for them as parents, and thus did not violate Due Process Clause or constitutional rights of parents, where grandparents had acted as parents for significant periods of time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were record owners of certain beachfront property which included a portion of beach historically used by the public without permission and maintained by defendant town. Plaintiffs filed a quiet title action against defendant town and all users of the property to determine both title and equitable use of the property. Defendant town counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of fee simple, adverse possession, acquiescence, and easement. The trial court found plaintiffs were the record title owners but defendant town established the town's and public's right to use the beach, through a prescriptive easement, for general recreational purposes and maintenance. Both sides appealed. The court affirmed, holding as a matter of law defendant town derived no title to the property absent an express grant from the proprietors, whereas language in deed of plaintiffs accurately conveyed the property to plaintiffs' forebears. Defendants failed to prove adverse possession under a claim of right but did prove prescriptive easement for &quot;general recreational purposes,&quot; as plaintiffs had acquiesced in these historic uses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants entered guilty pleas to 12 counts of disseminating sexually explicit materials. On appeal, they contended that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 2923 (1983), amended by Pub. L. 1983, ch. 223, was unconstitutionally vague, and that the court erred in sentencing them to three consecutive five-year sentences. The supreme court affirmed, holding that &sect; 2923 provided ample notice to an ordinary person that disseminating child pornography over the internet was prohibited. The statute prohibited the dissemination of &quot;any book, magazine, print, negative, slide, motion picture, videotape, or other mechanically reproduced visual material&quot; depicting child pornography. There was no doubt that defendants' computer was a machine and that its files contained &quot;mechanically reproduced visual material&quot; even though the material was not visible to the naked eye unless printed or displayed on a computer screen. As to defendants' sentences, defendants failed to show that the trial court exceeded its statutory powers.</SPAN></P>

By prohibiting the dissemination of videotapes, motion pictures, slides, and negatives depicting child pornography, the statute clearly reached the dissemination of stored images as well as finished pictures, and was not unconstitutionally vague.

The decision was affirmed on appeal. The legislature then amended Me. Rev. Stat.

Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the stop was granted by the trial court. Upon the State's appeal, the suppression was vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings. The rules promulgated by the chief of the state police were substantive rules required to be approved by the state legislature. The rules required stop lamps to emit a red light and required a vehicle's original or replacement lights to function.

The trial court also found the presence of an aggravating factor, and ordered that the Department be relieved of any obligation to provide reunification services to appellant. The court ruled that all of the elements of aggravated assault were present. Further, the court held that shaking a baby with the degree of force sufficient to cause shaken baby syndrome constituted a gross deviation from a reasonable person's standard of conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs applied to defendant town's planning board for a permit to construct a campground. The board denied the application, because the proposed site was in the Resource Protection District of the town's shoreland, which did not allow campgrounds, and the proposed campground did not satisfy the Georgetown, Maine, Shoreland Zoning Ordinance's conditional use guideline of conserving the area's natural beauty. Plaintiffs appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals (ZBA), which changed the district determination to one allowing campsites but affirmed the &quot;conserving natural beauty&quot; denial. Plaintiffs sued, challenging the constitutionality of the &quot;natural beauty&quot; requirement. Abutting landowners intervened, challenging the change of district. The court affirmed. The parties appealed. The appellate court affirmed the ZBA's discretionary findings, on the record, that the proposed site was in a district allowing campgrounds, but vacated and remanded with instructions to grant plaintiffs a permit, holding there was no way to quantify &quot;natural beauty&quot; so the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Me. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1992, when appellant was 15-years old, she was seriously injured in an automobile collision involving two vehicles. Appellant was a passenger in one of the vehicles, and the other vehicle was operated by a driver who died a year after the accident.

No probate proceedings regarding driver's estate were filed until 1999, when appellant filed a petition for formal adjudication of intestacy and appointment of a personal representative. In the petition, appellant requested that she, as a creditor, be named personal representative. The trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellant's claim could not be presented to driver's estate until there was a personal representative. The claim was premature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Cumberland County (Maine), which entered judgment following a jury verdict adverse to plaintiff's medical malpractice claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice complaint against defendants, alleging negligence. The trial court allowed the use of the unanimous adverse finding of the medical malpractice screening panel. It was proper for defendants to present the neutral medical malpractice screening panel findings to a jury, not to explain or litigate the panel findings, but to prevent a jury from drawing improper inferences from the total absence of information and the unexplained silence of plaintiff's counsel in the face of the highly prejudicial findings. The neutral comment supported the general &quot;without explanation&quot; mandate of the legislature designed to avoid a trial within a trial or any such process developing regarding unanimous panel findings. Plaintiffs had the burden of proof in the negligence action. It was the jury's duty to believe or disbelieve the witnesses and testimony and decide what inferences to draw from the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment finding no medical malpractice by defendants upheld, because the mention of the unanimous adverse finding of the medical malpractice screening panel was not prejudicial but rather used to explain plaintiff's silence, and the jury had the duty to accept or reject the testimony of witnesses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The J-Lot owners have an &quot;easement by implication based upon estoppel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The eastern boundary of Lot J-46 is the approximate mean high water mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The intent of I. Alan Balfour, in creating the drainage and walkway easement on the 1970 Plan was to provide access to Secret Beach to J-Lot owners for general recreational purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The following activities are permitted on the drainage and walkway easement: foot traffic; wheeled apparatuses incidental to foot traffic, such as baby strollers, wagons and wheelchairs; other modes of non-motorized travel, such as bicycles; and wheeled apparatuses incidental to the exercise of public trust rights to fish, fowl, and navigate in the intertidal zone, such as bringing kayaks on wheels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Motorized vehicles are not permitted on the drainage and walkway easement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The J-Lot owners may use the easement without time restrictions. J-Lot owners, and a reasonable number of guests, may use the easement to access Secret Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The electronic access system (i.e. the gate) is an unreasonable obstruction &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">[*2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"> of the Plaintiffs/Third Party Defendants use and enjoyment of the easement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The gate shall be removed. The surveillance cameras shall be removed. Woods and Muther may continue to have motion-detecting lights directed on the easement. Woods and Muther may post &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signage at the top of the easement. No other structures may be erected across or along the easement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The Court granted a Temporary Restraining Order against Mr. Woods and the owners of Lot J-46, based on the inherent interference with the easement rights of J-Lot owners. The TRO included a prohibition against Defendants' interfering with J-Lot owners' access and use of the easement, and one against all parties from behavior, including speech, which unreasonably interferes with the parties' peaceful enjoyment of their property rights. These restrictions are now a Permanent Injunction. These restrictions do not prevent Woods and Muther from making reasonable inquiries of users of the drainage and walkway easement.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to Woods and Muther's Counterclaim Count III (Overburdening of Easement) and Third Party Complaint Count VI (Overburdening of Easement):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The J-Lot owners have not overburdened the easement by &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">[*3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"> using the easement to access the intertidal zone on Secret Beach for recreational purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Use of the easement by J-Lot owners to cross over to Dr. William Holt's property is an impermissible overburdening of the easement and Woods and Muther may restrict the use of the easement to prevent persons from using the easement in this way.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to Third Party Defendants' Counterclaim Count VI (Prescriptive Easement to the intertidal zone and above the high-water mark):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The J-Lot owners' prescriptive claim regarding the intertidal zone in front of Lot J-46 is not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The J-Lot owners failed to establish a prescriptive easement over Woods and Muther's upland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The J-Lot owners failed to establish a prescriptive easement over the lands of Holt.</SPAN></P>
