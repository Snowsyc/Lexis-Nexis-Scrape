</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, three same-sex couples, sought review of a judgment of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which dismissed their declaratory judgment complaint. The couples sought to obtain marriage licenses from defendant county circuit court clerks. The Indiana Attorney General intervened on behalf of the clerk, and five amicus curiae briefs were filed in support of the State's position.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were all in same-sex long-term relationships, and had traveled to Vermont to enter into civil unions. The only impediment to their marriages was the opposite sex requirement of Ind. Code &sect; 31-11-1-1(b), and they sought a declaratory judgment for issuance of marriage licenses by the clerks. Plaintiffs claimed that &sect; 31-11-1-1(b) violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 1, 12, and 23. The trial court granted the State's motion to dismiss the complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Plaintiffs appealed and the court held that there was no violation of the Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23, as the reason for the disparate treatment was reasonably related to the State's responsible procreation justification and the interest in raising children within a stable environment. Similar reasons supported the court's holding that there was no violation of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12. Further, the limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples did not materially burden a &quot;core value&quot; protected by Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1. The court noted that it was doubtful whether art. 1, &sect; 1 was capable of independent judicial enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer cited defendant for violating the Ordinance due to loud music coming from his vehicle. After a bench trial, judgment was entered against defendant. He appealed, arguing, among other things, that the Ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because it prohibited any unusual or unnecessary noise, or any noise that annoyed others, within the city. The city argued that since Indiana's disorderly conduct statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-45-1-3(2), was held not to be vague and contained language that was less clear than the Ordinance, the Ordinance should survive the vagueness challenge. The court found that the disorderly conduct statute, unlike the Ordinance, contained a reasonableness test and required that a person be warned before being cited. Indianapolis, Ind., Rev. Code Consol. City &amp; County &sect; 391-302(a), (a)(2) did not include a sufficiently ascertainable standard of conduct to enable individuals of ordinary intelligence to adequately comprehend what conduct the Ordinance prohibited. Therefore, it was unconstitutionally vague. However, a portion of &sect; 391-302(a)(2) that clearly defined what noise was prohibited during a certain time period was not vague and was severable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant successor cemetery (SC) sought review from a judgment of the Allen Superior Court (Indiana), which granted summary judgment to appellee funeral service providers in their action, alleging breach of a settlement agreement and intentional interference with a contractual relationship. The trial court had held that the application of the Exclusive Rights Act, Ind. Code &sect; 23-14-46-7, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The providers' prior antitrust action resulted in a settlement agreement with the predecessor cemetery, which set forth a relationship between them of unlimited duration which was binding on successors. The SC indicated that it would not be bound by the agreement. The providers filed suit, and each party sought summary judgment. The trial court granted partial summary judgment to the providers, finding that the providers were entitled to specific performance of the agreement. The trial court struck a cemetery official's affidavit. The cemetery appealed, and the court found that it was error for the trial court to have stricken the supplemental affidavit of the cemetery, as it provided additional evidence to rebut the providers' assertion that they had performed under the agreement. Further, the providers failed to meet their burden of showing that they were entitled to specific performance under the agreement. The court held that application of the Act was not unconstitutional, as there was no violation of the Contracts Clause of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 24. Further, the Act was reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the general public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, and remanded the matter with directions for the trial court to enter summary judgment in favor of the cemetery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal seeking review of the judgment of the Hamilton Superior Court (Indiana), which denied defendant's motion to dismiss in his criminal action. Defendant had alleged that Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-6, regarding class C felony child solicitation, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police detective logged on to an internet chat room and impersonated a 13-year-old girl. Defendant allegedly instant messaged the detective, made several sexually explicit remarks, and arranged a meeting. When defendant arrived at the time and place of the meeting, he was arrested. Defendant argued that Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-6 violated his right to free speech. In order to pass constitutional muster, &sect; 35-42-4-6 had to be necessary to serve a compelling state interest, and it had to be narrowly drawn. Section 35-42-4-6 served the compelling state interests of preventing adults from urging children to have sex and proactively seeking child predators prior to the child being harmed. The use of an undercover officer instead of a child was a necessary means to accomplish the State's compelling interests. Section 35-42-4-6 was narrowly drawn despite defendant's argument that it merely criminalized solicitation of an adult police officer. Section 35-42-4-6, however, involved the belief that the police officer was an underage girl. Furthermore, &sect; 35-42-4-6 was not unconstitutional merely because it failed to protect speech that involved a mistake of fact.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded that the admission of the breath test instrument certification documents at issue here did not violate the rule set forth in Crawford. The appellate court noted that certificates regarding the inspection and compliance with relevant regulations of breath test instruments were admissible in prosecutions for operating a vehicle with a BAC of 0.08 percent or greater. Such certifications were not included in the class of evidence that were subject to Confrontation Clause scrutiny. However, the appellate court also found that admitting into evidence the BAC ticket purporting to prove the breath test results, absent any &quot;live&quot; testimony that would establish a foundation for its admission, was improper because the State failed to establish an adequate evidentiary foundation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the State did not present sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction and that the trial court abused its discretion when it imposed a 12-year enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence at trial showed that defendant was present during a fight between two individuals and rejected another onlooker's suggestion that they break up the fight.

He, then, drove the individual away from the crime scene. Defendant was convicted. The trial court also imposed an enhanced sentence against defendant. On appeal, the court held that sufficient evidence sustained defendant's conviction for attempted aggravated battery as an accomplice because defendant's conduct before, during, and after the shooting was fully consistent with that of an accomplice. Further, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced defendant to two years longer than the presumptive sentence for the crime. While the trial court improperly considered an aggravating factor to which defendant did not admit and on which the jury did not make findings, the court found that the enhanced sentence was proper because the trial court found the existence of two valid aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, parents of a deceased child, appealed from a grant of summary judgment by the St. Joseph Superior Court (Indiana) in favor of defendant physician in a wrongful death action arising out of the physician's alleged medical malpractice in delivering the child. The parents argued that Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 precluded the trial court's holding that their action was time-barred under Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1 (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although &sect; 34-18-7-1 provided a two-year limitations period for filing medical malpractice claims, in the case of child patients, such a claim could be filed until the child reached eight years of age. The parents never filed a negligence action while their child was living, but they filed an action under the Child Wrongful Death Statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 34-23-2-1 (1998), when he died at the age of two. The two-year period had expired by then, but the parents argued that since the medical malpractice limitations statute had already been held applicable to wrongful death actions, its extension in cases involving injuries to children should likewise be applicable. The appellate court agreed. The parents were similarly situated to parents whose children had not died between expiration of the limitations period and their eighth birthdays, and yet their wrongful death action would be held time-barred under the physician's proposed interpretation of &sect; 34-18-7-1 while the other parents' negligence action would not be.

The appellate court disagreed, noting that, inter alia, defendant was pulled over only after officers observed him driving without a seat belt, he was detained only after giving officers the wrong name and the registration to another vehicle, and an inventory search was performed after officers properly impounded the vehicle for improper registration. Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial on the basis that witnesses were being excused without the court asking jurors if they had questions. The appellate court found no error as the trial court informed jurors of the procedure for asking questions and was not required to inquire after each witness. Finally, defendant argued that he received an improper double enhancement. Because the appellate court found that defendant's habitual substance offender determination was the only enhancement, he was not the recipient of an improper double enhancement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had slowed and begun to make a left-hand turn into a gas station when he struck a motorcycle. The motorcycle driver was killed and his 11-year old nephew was injured. While speaking with defendant, a deputy did not observe any physical signs of intoxication, but had difficulty ascertaining defendant's physical condition because he was receiving medical treatment at the time. Defendant expressed some confusion as to what his address was. Without requesting permission or advising defendant in any way and without claiming on a hospital request form that he had probable cause to do so, the deputy asked the hospital staff to obtain blood and urine samples from defendant, and the hospital staff complied. The appellate court held the deputy did not properly attain defendant's consent to a portable breath test or chemical test without some objectively observed clear indication of intoxication, such as dilated pupils, telltale odor or failed field sobriety test(s). Defendant's difficulty in answering the deputy's questions was not significant enough, by itself, to provide the probable cause. Thus, the urine toxicology test results should not have been admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants lived together as roommates. During one occurrence, the female defendant had custody of her children, age five and age three. Also present were the male defendant's children, who were older, and defendant's brother. The brother decided to play a game with the older children called &quot;hostage,&quot; where their wrists and ankles were taped together with light construction tape and the children competed to see who could break free first. While the female defendant was cutting the tape from behind the three-year-old's stroller with a pocketknife, the child reared back and sustained a superficial cut. On a second occasion children again took turns having their wrists and ankles taped and hopped about the house. The appellate court held that although the so-called &quot;hostage&quot; game was somewhat bizarre and not something many child development experts would condone, there was insufficient evidence that playing the game exposed the children to a substantial, actual, and appreciable risk of mental or physical harm. Furthermore, there was insufficient evidence that defendants were subjectively aware of a high probability that the children were endangered by the taping.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, appellant City brought proceedings against appellee landlords, alleging that the landlords failed to pay the annual landlord registration fee required by Vincennes, Ind., Code of Ordinances &sect; 156.04 for multiple years in varying amounts. The Knox Superior Court (Indiana) found that the city Rental Housing Code, Vincennes, Ind., Code of Ordinances &sect;&sect; 156.01-156.06 was unconstitutional. The City appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City argued that the landlords did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the housing code because any injury to them was only speculative. The appellate court disagreed. Every two years, rental units were subject to a mandatory inspection, and it was clearly the landlords' interests that were implicated in the inspection. Therefore, the landlords had standing. In order to satisfy the requirements of Camara and thus pass muster under the Fourth Amendment, the housing code was required to give the landlords the option to consent and to include a warrant procedure to be followed in the event the landlords refused to consent to a search. The city Rental Housing Code did not, and it was therefore unconstitutional on its face. Because the ability to maintain a rental unit pursuant to the housing code was ultimately tied to the inspection of the unit, the constitutionally invalid provision was not distinct and separable from the remainder of the housing code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Pike Circuit Court (Indiana) convicting him on jury verdict of dealing in methamphetamine (by manufacturing it) and visiting a common nuisance. He challenged denial of his suppression motion, an alleged limitation on cross-examination, the sufficiency of the evidence, whether imposition of an enhanced sentence was proper, and various rulings regarding fees and bail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police investigating a tip regarding smells suggestive of a methamphetamine manufacturing operation approached a mobile home. Smelling chemicals and observing other &quot;meth lab&quot; evidence, they approached the house and arrested the occupants and others, including defendant. The appeals court held that under the totality of the circumstances, it was reasonable to have approached and entered the house without a warrant and that the evidence found there, including methamphetamine in process of manufacture, was sufficient to support conviction and a nuisance determination. Cross-examination was not limited where the trial judge merely warned the defense that certain questions could open the door to risky rebuttal. Under Apprendi and Blakely, defendant should not have been subject to an enhanced sentence without jury findings, since his criminal history was negligible. A drug fee should not have been assessed without a finding of means to pay, defendant's cash bail should have been returned to him, and, finally, his threats against the prosecutor and his family justified immediate revocation of bail as long as a hearing was held soon thereafter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence, as well as an order regarding payment of a drug fee and an order that his cash bail be retained. It remanded for resentencing and for a determination as to whether defendant had the means to pay a statutory drug fee and in what amount.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with battery while armed with a deadly weapon, a Class C felony, in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-2-1(a)(3). A jury found defendant guilty as charged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. Defendant contested only one element of battery - that she did not touch the victim in a rude, insolent, or angry manner when she stabbed him. The appellate court concluded that the evidence produced at trial showed that defendant became angry with the victim, brandished a knife in an effort to intimidate him, and accidentally stabbed the victim instead of the couch. That evidence was sufficient for a reasonable fact finder to have concluded that defendant touched the victim in a rude, insolent, or angry manner. Defendant also contended that her sentence was inappropriate and was improperly enhanced. Defendant argued that her Sixth Amendment right to have the facts supporting the enhancement of her sentence tried to a jury was violated. Of the four aggravating factors used by the trial court, the only one at issue was that defendant was on probation at the time of the offense. Because a single aggravating factor was adequate to justify a sentence enhancement, the failure to have one of four factors proved beyond a reasonable doubt did not require reversal of defendant's enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the warrantless search that resulted in the dog's seizure was improper because the doghouse was within an area where he had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The State asserted that the evidence was admissible under the &quot;open fields&quot; doctrine. The appellate court held that the warrantless search violated both the Indiana and United States Constitutions. Defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the doghouse and the officer's search, in the absence of exigent circumstances, was unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. Among other things, the officer invaded defendant's curtilage when he left the obvious and direct route to the house and pulled the dog out of the doghouse. In addition, the officer walked into the yard even though he saw nothing from the driveway that would have given him suspicion a crime had occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mortgage corporation challenged the decision of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which dismissed the mortgage corporation's complaint against appellees, a county treasurer, a county auditor, and a property tax assessment board of appeals. The mortgage company asserted federal claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 (1998) and state claims under the Indiana Tort Claims Act (ITCA), Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 34-13-3-1 (1998) et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cause of action arose as a result of the mortgage corporation paying property taxes one day late on numerous parcels of real estate. The county treasurer assessed a penalty for the delinquent tax payment pursuant to Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 6-1.1-37-10(a) (2003), which the mortgage corporation paid. The lawsuit was filed after the county auditor refused to refund the penalty. The trial court dismissed the complaint without specifying the grounds for the dismissal, though the motion for dismissal asserted that the actions were time-barred due to the applicable statute of limitations of two years to tort claims and because the mortgage corporation failed to file notice under the ITCA. The court held that the Journey's Account statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 34-11-8-1 (1998), saved the mortgage corporation's federal claims from the applicable statute of limitations. However, the notice requirements of the ITCA barred its state law claims because the mortgage corporation failed to demonstrate substantial compliance with the notice requirements of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 34-13-3-8 (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the mortgage corporation's state law claims but reversed the dismissal of the &sect; 1983 claims. The court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings with regard to the &sect; 1983 claims.</SPAN></P>

The buyers were required to send the notice of sale to the owner's last address, as shown in the county auditor's records. The buyers did send notices of sale and the filing to the owner's last address, as shown in those records. The buyers also sent the notice of filing to the owner at an alternate residence. The owner's wife signed for delivery, but the owner claimed that she did not give the notice to him. The auditor had no other records that linked the owner with a different address, and the auditor was not required to search other records to find a valid address.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant clinic challenged a decision from the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which dismissed its complaint against appellee class of state prosecuting attorneys. The clinic's complaint sought to challenge the constitutionality of Ind. Code &sect; 16-34-2-1.1, which was a statute requiring voluntary and informed consent to abortion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clinic challenged the constitutionality of Ind. Code &sect; 16-34-2-1.1, claiming that the statute's requirement that women seeking abortions receive in-person counseling at least 18 hours before obtaining an abortion infringed the women's right to privacy under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 by requiring two trips to the clinic. The clinic also claimed the requirement that abortion providers orally convey information specified in the statute to women seeking an abortion violated free speech under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. When the complaint was dismissed under Ind. R. Trial P. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim, the clinic appealed. The court found that the privacy right in Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, protected the right to seek an abortion, and a hearing was necessary on whether the two-trip requirement was an impermissible material burden on that right. However, the statute was a valid exercise of the state's police power since it related to a legitimate state interest in making sure women gave informed consent to an abortion. Therefore, the statute did not infringe on the free speech rights in Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed dismissal of the clinic's complaint and ordered that a hearing be held on whether the challenged statute imposed a material burden on the constitutional right to privacy.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the condition of probation that he was found to have violated was impermissibly vague and that the finding that he violated a term and condition of his probation was unsupported by the evidence. The appellate court held that the condition was not sufficiently clear to inform defendant of what conduct would result in his being returned to prison. Consequently, this condition of probation was void for vagueness and the trial court abused its discretion by revoking defendant's probation.</SPAN></P>

He argued that underrepresentation of African Americans in the venire violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the manner in which jury venires were pulled in the county where he was tried, from six regions into which the 19 zip codes were divided, resulted in a venire, in his case, with only one African American. The appeals court held that defendant's bare assertion of unfairness did not meet his burden to show statistical underrepresentation resulting from the selection method used. On its own motion, the appeals court noticed that the trial court said it had merged the convictions of intentional and felony murder before sentencing him. There was nothing wrong with the sentences themselves, but, to avoid double jeopardy violations, if the trial court had in fact entered judgment on the felony murder count before claiming to merge the murder convictions (it was not clear from the record if this was in fact what the judge had done), it had let too many convictions stand.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff daughter, as personal representative of plaintiff mother's estate, appealed from an order of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) compelling arbitration of the estate's survival and wrongful death claims against defendant nursing home. The estate argued that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and illegal, that it had been deprived of the right to trial by jury, and that the clause was not binding on it as a nonparty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter placed her mother, who suffered from Alzheimer's Disease, in the nursing home under hurried circumstances in the midst of a care crisis. The daughter did not read much of the agreement and missed the arbitration clause. There was no showing of unconscionability, however, as the clause was prominently placed and nursing home staff were available to discuss the agreement with her. Shortly after her admission, the mother had a bad fall and developed other problems that soon led to her death. The appellate court upheld the validity of the clause. Not only was it not unconscionable, but it was also not forbidden consideration given in return for nursing home admission within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396r(c)(5)(A)(iii). The guarantee of a jury trial in civil cases under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 could be waived, and that was accomplished by the arbitration clause. Finally, the estate could not argue that it was not bound by the agreement because it was not a party to it. Ind. Code &sect; 34-23-1-1 made it clear that a personal representative could pursue a survival and wrongful death claim only subject to the same defenses that could have been raised against the decedent.</SPAN></P>

The State failed to show that defendant entered the park after having been denied entry by the park or its agent. While police had to enforce municipal ordinances pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 36-8-3-6(c)(3), the municipal ordinance, Kokomo, Ind., Mun. Code &sect; 96.19, merely authorized an officer to order a person from a city park for misbehavior. The ordinance did not give the authority to ban a person from the park on a permanent basis. While Ind. Code &sect; 35-43-2-2 permitted private property owners to permanently bar a person from the owner's property, the powers of police officers were limited by Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 36-8-3-6, -10, neither of which granted such authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was 16 at the time of the incident, had guests at his house who had an altercation. One guest's father came to pick her up, and as he started to drive a few of the guests away, defendant kicked in the door of his father's locked bedroom, retrieved a semi-automatic rifle, and fired at the car. Defendant was arrested and convicted of numerous offenses. On appeal, the court found defendant was properly charged in adult criminal court rather than in juvenile court, as the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction under Ind. Code &sect; 31-30-1-4(a) (1998 &amp; Supp. 2003). Sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction for firearm possession, as there was sufficient evidence that defendant was under 18 years old and that he did not have permission to possess the gun. The jury reasonably inferred that defendant possessed the specific intent to commit the attempted murder. Exclusion of a witness's testimony as to defendant's possible motive to harm her was proper and even if erroneous, was harmless in the circumstances. Defendant's sentence was appropriate, as there were no mitigating factors found and several aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother challenged the order of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which dismissed the mother's medical malpractice claim defendants, two attending physicians and a hospital, under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. Originally, the plaintiff was the mother's child. Upon the death of the child, the mother was substituted as plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action arose from alleged medical malpractice by the attending physicians, which triggered birth complications to the child that caused serious and permanent physical and mental injuries. Within two years of the child's 18th birthday, the action was filed, which was in compliance with the law at the time the child was born. However, after the child's birth, the law changed and the Indiana Medical Malpractice Act, Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 34-18-7-1-1(b), made the statute of limitations from the child's 20th birthday to her eighth birthday. Unaware of the change in the law, the child commenced suit within two years of her 18th birthday. The court held that &sect; 34-18-7-1-1(b) was unconstitutional as it applied to minors, in that it violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The court held that that the classification between minors injured by medical malpractice and minor victims of other torts was no longer reasonably related to the goal of maintaining sufficient medical treatment and controlling malpractice insurance costs. Further, within the class of minors injured by medical malpractice, not all minors were treated equally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of dismissal and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 8, &sect; 1. The corporation cross-appealed from a finding of violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV guarantees as to poor children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To balance its budget, the corporation instituted the student fee, which was used for many purposes, including paying certain educational staff members.

Looking at the provision in historical context and with attention to the plain meaning of &quot;tuition,&quot; which was forbidden in the guarantee of common schools, the appeals court held that it related to teaching or instruction. Even though the fee was not very large, if it were allowed, there would be no way to prevent schools in the future from charging larger amounts in order to avoid raising taxes, thereby creating the very evil the framers had sought to avoid when they tried to assure an education for all.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 35-41-2-4 and 35-42-1-3, a Class A felony. Defendant contended that the testimony of the principal that he participated in the killing was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, and that his sentence was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While drinking in their apartment, defendant and his roommate became angered with their guest. Defendant left the room, returning and getting into a fight with the guest. He had left the room to don his prosthetic arm, which had a hook at the end. Testimony of his roommate showed that defendant had hit the victim, shouted to the roommate to continue beating the victim, and helped dispose of the victim. The victim's body showed that he was hit with a hammer and probably a screw driver. Defendant's own blood, but none of the victim, was found on his prosthetic arm and the roommate testified that defendant had told him that he would wash the area and his arm with bleach to eliminate any DNA. On appeal, the court found the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction. The court held that the uncorroborated testimony of the roommate as an accomplice was sufficient, rejecting defendant's contention that the &quot;incredible dubiosity&quot; rule applied. The court then considered defendant's sentencing appeal, holding that under Ind. R. App. P. 7(B), because his sentence was within the range and appropriate in light of the nature of his offense, it was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the LaPorte Superior Court (Indiana) that convicted him of violating Ind. Code &sect; 9-19-10-2, the seat belt law. He argued on appeal that the statute violated his equal privileges and immunities guaranteed under Ind. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Indiana's motor vehicle registration law, defendant's utility vehicle could have been registered as either a passenger car or a truck. He registered it as a passenger car and was arrested for noncompliance with the seat belt law, which applied only to passenger vehicles. The appeals court adhered to its earlier Price decision and found no unequal treatment depriving defendant of his privileges and immunities in the legislative decision to treat passenger vehicles and trucks differently, even though the categories overlapped. Defendant had waived a similar federal equal protection argument. The appeals court also found no substantive due process violation. It could not be said that a driver's right to drive as he chose was a property right or that it rose to the level of such issues as reproductive decisions, in which substantive due process was sometimes invoked. Moreover, the law was rationally related to the proper state aim of reducing traffic fatalities.</SPAN></P>

The board counterclaimed for an order to remove the mobile home from the town. The trial court denied the complaint for a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mobile home owners transported their mobile home to the mobile home park. The town had an ordinance regulating mobile homes. The ordinance required that all persons moving mobile homes into the town needed to have a license issued by the board. Thus, the mobile home park requested a license for the mobile home owners to occupy their mobile home in its mobile home park. However, the ordinance specifically provided in a separate paragraph that mobile homes that were five years of age or older were restricted from being moved into the town for occupancy. As a result, the board voted against approving the requested license for the mobile home owners because their mobile home was at least five years old at the time the application for the license was submitted. On appeal, the court found that (1) the ordinance was not an ultra vires act or unenforceable as a matter of law; and (2) the ordinance did not violate the Equal Privileges Clause of Ind. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The probationer was convicted of burglary and received a sentence of probation. About seven months after his probation expired, his probation officer petitioned to revoke his probation and alleged, inter alia, that he failed to pay restitution, that he had failed to complete a drug treatment program, and that he was found in contempt of court after the probationary period ended because he had not paid child support. The probation officer knew of the violations at or near the time they occurred. The probationer moved to dismiss on the ground that the petition was untimely filed, but the trial court denied the motion. It then revoked his probation. It also overruled his objection that submitting a DNA sample was not required of probationers and ruled that a state statute required that he submit such a sample. On appeal, the appellate court agreed that pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-2-3(a)(2)(B), the petition to revoke was not filed within the required 45 days after the State received notice of the probation violations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a husband and his wife, appealed an order from the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which granted summary judgment to defendant Indiana State Department of Health, and which denied a cross-motion for summary judgment, on the issue of whether the husband complied with the notice provisions of the Indiana Tort Claims Act (TCA), Ind. Code &sect; 34-13-3-6(a), in presenting a personal injury claim to the Department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was tested for HIV at a clinic, which forwarded the sample to the Department. The husband was told he was HIV positive, but was not instructed to undergo re-testing. He was monitored for eight years, but was not re-tested. On a trip out of the country, the husband was required to submit to an HIV test, which returned a negative result. The husband served a tort claim notice on the Department. A complaint was also filed alleging the Department negligently performed the original HIV test and negligently failed to order retesting. The Department moved for summary judgment claiming the notice was not filed within 270 days after the loss occurred, as required by the TCA. After the trial court granted the Department's motion, the husband appealed. The Department argued the husband's loss occurred when the erroneous positive result was given, so the claim was not timely. The husband argued the negative result eight years later triggered the notice period. The court found the statutory period to file the notice was triggered when the husband's personal injury claim arose, which was when he discovered he was not HIV positive. The summary judgment grant was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment for the Department, it reversed the denial of the husband's cross-motion for summary judgment, and it remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant applied for adjustment of claim against appellee, his former employer. He late amended his application to include appellee company, which he alleged was the former employer's successor. The Worker's Compensation Board (Indiana) dismissed the matter on grounds that the claim was time-barred. The claimant appealed, arguing that Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-7-9(f) as applied to him violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant, who was totally disabled, alleged he was diagnosed with possible Alzheimer's disease. A psychiatrist concluded that his exposure to aluminum while working for his former employer was the likely cause of his cognitive problems. The claimant filed his application more than 10 years after the last date on which he worked for the worker, and it was undisputed that his disability occurred more than two years after the last day of his last exposure to the hazards of his disease. Therefore, Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-7-9(f) barred his claim. The claimant alleged he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable diligence, could not have discovered that he had suffered a disease-causing exposure in the course of and arising out of his employment before the two-year period of repose expired. Therefore, he argued, &sect; 22-3-7-9(f) was unconstitutional as applied to him. The appellate court held that precedent from the state supreme court compelled it to conclude that &sect; 22-3-7-9(f), a statute of repose rather than a statute of limitations, did not violate Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 (which guaranteed citizens' access to the courts) as applied in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Worker's Compensation Board of Indiana dismissed appellant former employee's claim against appellee former employer for worker's compensation benefits, ruling that because the employee had settled with one or more third parties, pursuant to Ind.

He and his wife filed a civil suit for damages against a number of defendants and accepted payment pursuant to several settlement agreements. A jury returned a verdict in their favor against several other defendants, including the employer, but there was no evidence that the judgment was paid and accepted. The employee argued that &sect; 22-3-7-36(b) did not bar his claim against the employer until his third-party action was fully concluded by settlement or judgment which was procured and paid. The appellate court agreed. Even though the employee had settled with some defendants and had been paid by them, his third party action was not fully concluded because the judgment in his favor had not yet been paid. Therefore, the Board's dismissal of the employee's application for worker's compensation benefits was premature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Greene Superior Court (Indiana), which convicted him of sexual misconduct with a minor in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-9 (Supp. 2003). The trial court imposed the presumptive sentence as well as a term of probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a friend of the victim's father, and eventually the minor victim and defendant entered into a &quot;romantic relationship,&quot; which resulted in the victim becoming pregnant and giving birth to a baby girl. Defendant was charged and convicted, and he was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, of which three years were suspended, as well as a term of probation. The trial court found that due to the balancing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the presumptive sentence was appropriate, and further, that any sentence less than 10 years would depreciate the seriousness of the crime. On appeal, the court found that although two aggravating factors lacked record support - that the crime was likely to recur and that the victim was impeded in her future plans by having a child - no reversal of the sentence was required. The court found that the sentence imposed was appropriate. However, a probation condition authorizing searches by the probation department was violative of U.S. Const. amend. IV. Other conditions imposed were found to lack sufficient specificity to properly inform defendant of which conduct would constitute a probation violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, but remanded the matter back to the trial court with instructions to revise the probation conditions in order to: 1) reflect that any search must be reasonable; 2) set out any prohibition against materials related to deviant interests and behaviors with more specificity; and 3) reconsider and clarify the prohibition against defendant's presence where children congregated.</SPAN></P>

The Porter Superior Court (Indiana) found defendant to be a repeat sexual offender and sentenced him to 20 years on the underlying convictions and to an additional 10 years based on his repeat sexual offender status. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion in instructing the jury that the uncorroborated testimony of one witness alone was sufficient to sustain a conviction so long as it convinced the jury beyond a reasonable doubt as to defendant's guilt on each essential element of the charge. The appellate court concluded that defendant waived the issue for review, having failed to object to the instruction at trial, and that, even if it had not been waived, any error was harmless as the subject testimony was corroborated. Defendant also contended that Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-14 violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, because it does not allow a jury to determine the law and the facts regarding his status as a repeat sexual offender following a jury trial and conviction on the underlying felony. The appellate court concluded that the right to have a jury determine the facts and the law regarding a defendant's repeat sexual offender status existed by virtue of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, and therefore, Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-14 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed. The adjudication that defendant was a repeat sexual offender and corresponding sentence enhancement were vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with numerous criminal offenses, including Class A misdemeanor distribution of obscene matter and exhibition of obscene matter based on the images that had been displayed on the computer. Defendant's motion to suppress was granted. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) found defendant guilty of the aforementioned charges and sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of 180 days on each count. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Indiana's obscenity statute was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to give the type of notice that would enable an ordinary citizen to comprehend precisely what conduct was prohibited. The appellate court found said argument waived on appeal. Defendant also contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions because the materials he displayed and sold were not obscene and were displayed in the privacy of his own home. The appellate court concluded that it was within the fact finder's prerogative to find the materials, displaying a woman having sexual intercourse with a dog and a woman having oral sex with a horse, obscene. In addition, because defendant displayed the images in his home for the purpose of making a sale, his actions were not constitutionally protected. Finally, defendant's claim that his convictions violated double jeopardy principles failed, as each conviction required proof of an element the other did not; the conviction for exhibition required proof that defendant &quot;showed&quot; the obscene material, whereas the conviction for distribution required proof defendant did in fact distribute the material.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizen, an employee of an attorney who sued a law firm on behalf of several individuals and sought to compel appellee small claims court to allow him to inspect and copy an affidavit under the Indiana Access to Public Records Act (APRA), Ind. Code &sect; 5-14-3, sought review of the grant of summary judgment by the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) in favor of the small claims court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The affidavit concerned the procedure for filing claims in the small claims court and it confirmed the judge's policy that no complaint tendered for filing in her court would be rejected by the clerical staff for lack of attachments. An attorney of the law firm asked the judge to sign it and she did not retain a copy of the affidavit. The parties to the lawsuit, which involved the affidavit, filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice pursuant to a settlement agreement. The appellate court held the citizen was not required to state a reason for his request. Thus, there was still an issue as to whether the citizen rightfully had access to the affidavit. The small claims court did not create the affidavit. Nor did it retain, maintain, or file the affidavit. The judge signed the affidavit as a witness. She was not acting in her official capacity. Because it was not a public record, the small claims court was not required to follow the mandates of the APRA with regard to the timeliness of its response and a reason for denying the citizen's request. Also, the small claims court did not have a copy of the affidavit and therefore could not produce it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sued appellee for negligence and a jury held against him after finding appellant 85 percent at fault and appellee 15 percent at fault.

The record did not reflect that appellee paid the jury's per diem or mileage costs, the jury's lunch and dinner costs, or the bailiff reimbursement for jury expenses. As such, appellant was therefore not obliged to &quot;indemnify&quot; her for such. Rather, the costs imposed on appellant seemed to be in the nature of a penalty imposed on him as the losing party and they were therefore improper. The jury costs the trial court assessed were not filing fees nor were they statutory witness fees. As a result, the trial court erred in assessing jury costs and expenses against appellant in the absence of authorization by statute or court rule.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that, although the student's expulsion had ended, it would consider the allegedly moot issue as a question of great public importance. The student's contention that he did not engage in unlawful activity was based on the faulty premise that a prosecutor had to make this determination, rather than on a cogent argument asserting that his threat to shoot his schoolmates did not constitute unlawful activity. As such, the student failed to establish that the board's decision to expel him was arbitrary and capricious, as defined by Ind. Code &sect; 4-21.5-5-14(d).</SPAN></P>

This statute did not save the widow's case, based on the prior class actions, or under the rule that she could file with the Department of Insurance before the class actions were dismissed, because those actions did not allege medical malpractice, and, for &sect; 34-11-8-1 to apply, the later suit had to continue the prior suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lendees and a putative class, who had obtained loans secured by second mortgages, sought review of the judgment of the Vanderburgh Circuit Court (Indiana) which dismissed all nine lendees' cases against defendant non-holders of the loans. All nine complaints alleged similar violations of the Indiana Uniform Consumer Credit Code (IUCCC), namely, that excessive origination fees were charged on their second mortgage loans.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaints did not allege that the 64 non-holders were current or former holders of the second mortgage loans at issue, nor did they allege any relationship, contractual or otherwise. Rather, the complaints only contended that the non-holders held promissory notes related to the mortgage loans made to the lendees and the putative class members. The appellate court held the lendees failed to establish any personal stake in their lawsuits against the non-holders, and could not establish any injury or harm caused by the non-holders. Even assuming the loan origination fees were excessive, the lendees could not recover from the non-holders, who had no alleged connection to them or their loans. In short, the non-holders were not proper defendants. The dismissal of the non-holders on the basis of standing was proper. Also, the &quot;class&quot; had not been certified. The complaints were merely proposed class actions. Thus, there was no standing regarding the classwide basis against the non-holders. Neither of two defendant lenders could have relied upon or acted in conformity with a letter written after the loans were made. Therefore, the &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision of the IUCCC was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the grant of two lenders' motions to dismiss and remanded to the trial court for matters consistent with the proceedings. The judgment was affirmed as to the non-holders. Thus, the judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner former husband appealed an order of the Madison Superior Court III (Indiana), regarding the husband's overpayment of an alleged child support arrearage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indiana Title IV-D agency notified the husband of a significant arrearage in his child support payments. The husband responded immediately, contesting the existence of any arrearage and providing the agency with documentation of his payments. He then received correspondence with language that indicated that the matter had been resolved. Nonetheless, the agency, acting pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 31-16-15 but without notice to the husband, issued an order for employer withholding of child support. That action resulted in an overpayment of child support. On appeal, the husband asserted that &sect; 31-16-15 was unconstitutional, that his due process rights had been violated, and that the trial court miscalculated the amount of overpayment. The court held that (1) the husband had waived his constitutional challenge to &sect; 31-16-15; (2) the agency violated the husband's due process rights when it failed to follow the notice and hearing requirements of Ind. Code &sect; 31-16-15-7 before issuing the withholding order; (3) the trial court failed to provide a coherent basis for its overpayment determination; and (4) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the husband attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case with instructions that the trial court first determine whether the agency possessed statutory authority to initiate the proceeding against the husband, and if so, to set forth a calculation of the proper overpayment to be credited to the husband. In the event the agency was without authority, the overpayment was to be determined and the withholding order was to be terminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, defendant challenged a judgment on jury verdict of the Lake Superior Court (Indiana) that convicted him of rape, robbery, and criminal deviate conduct and from a judgment of the same court that denied his petition for post-conviction relief, sought on grounds of newly discovered evidence and counsel ineffectiveness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Strong circumstantial evidence connected defendant and four other men to the abduction, robbery, and repeated rapes of the victim. In his direct appeal, defendant challenged various evidentiary rulings and an instruction, but the appeals court held that allowing a highway maintenance worker to testify regarding auto glass shattering was only harmless error, and that evidence about defendant's frequenting of strip clubs did not relate to misconduct at all. An instruction regarding the basis for finding defendant guilty as an associate of his co-defendants correctly stated Indiana law, despite overruled case law to the contrary. Post-conviction relief was also unavailable. DNA results obtained 10 years after the first round of tests remained too inconclusive to constitute newly discovered evidence and the fact that counsel, who had sleep apnea, briefly dozed just once during trial did not make him ineffective. Furthermore, since none of the objections counsel failed to raise during trial could have succeeded and affected defendant's outcome, the failure to object was also not ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed a delinquency petition under Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-11(1) subjected him to double jeopardy when, based on the same possession of marijuana, he had already been subjected to a forfeiture under Ind. Code &sect; 34-24-1-1. While forfeiture under Ind. Code &sect; 34-24-1-1 was tied to criminal activity, the government was not required to establish scienter. Serving more than a punitive purpose, civil forfeiture proceedings advanced diverse legislative interests; while punishing and deterring those who have engaged in illegal drug activity, forfeiture also advanced other non-punitive, remedial legislative goals. This evidence did not provide the clearest proof necessary to show that the proceeding was criminal. Therefore, an in rem forfeiture under Ind. Code &sect; 34-24-1-1 was civil for purposes of the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause. Because civil forfeiture under Ind. Code &sect; 34-24-1-1 was not punishment for Fifth Amendment purposes, the Double Jeopardy Clause was not violated when defendant was required to forfeit $ 550 and then was alleged to be a delinquent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the unauthorized practice of law. Defendant filed a motion seeking dismissal of the charges. The Marion Superior Court, Criminal Division, Room 7 (Indiana), denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the supreme court was granted exclusive and original jurisdiction of matters concerning the unauthorized practice of law by Ind. Const. art. 7, &sect; 4. Consequently, he asserted that the superior court had no jurisdiction to try him for a violation of Ind. Code &sect; 33-1-5-1. Further, he claimed that the enactment of Ind. Code &sect; 33-1-5-1 by the General Assembly amounted to a violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government, in contravention of Ind. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1. The appellate court concluded that the grant of original jurisdiction in Ind. Const. art. 7, &sect; 4 did one thing--it gave the supreme court the power to entertain and decide all cases involving the issue of unauthorized practice of law. However, it did not give the supreme court the power to hear cases concerning the unauthorized practice of law to the exclusion of other courts. Thus, the appellate court held that trial courts appropriately had jurisdiction to conduct trials in which an individual was charged with the unauthorized practice of law under Ind. Code &sect; 33-1-5-1. The appellate court further found no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Indiana Department of Natural Resources was granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) ordering appellant landowner to cease any and all excavation and construction activities below the shoreline of a lake. The landowner ceased all activities that required entering the lake's waters. The Cass Circuit Court (Indiana) found the landowner in contempt for violating the TRO, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department alleged that the landowner was dumping construction debris into the lake and altering its shoreline without a permit. The landowner was found to be in contempt of the TRO based on construction done below the shoreline. On appeal, the landowner argued that the trial court abused its discretion in finding him in contempt because, inter alia, the TRO failed to give any definition of the word &quot;shoreline.&quot; The appellate court concluded that said failure rendered the TRO inherently ambiguous. The lack of clarity and certainty as to what constituted the lake's &quot;shoreline,&quot; and hence what the landowner was prohibited from doing, meant that the trial court abused its discretion by holding the landowner in contempt. Although the Department presented evidence of where it eventually calculated the &quot;shoreline&quot; to be, it presented no evidence that the landowner was aware of its calculation, made several months after the TRO was entered. The Department, therefore, failed to establish that the definition of &quot;shoreline&quot; was so obvious that the landowner was on clear notice of what he could and could not do so as to support the conclusion that he willfully violated the TRO.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the convictions, and that &sect; 35-48-4-6 was unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the execution of a search warrant issued as part of a murder investigation, police discovered firearms and cocaine in defendant's apartment. Affirming defendant's convictions, the court first held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because (1) the information provided in support of the warrant affidavit was presumptively reliable; (2) the information was not stale because the probable cause continued to exist at the time of the search; (3) there was a fair probability that the weapons would be found in the apartment where the murder suspect spent a lot of time; and (4) a pistol was an object that might reasonably fit inside a cigar box. The court then held that the evidence was sufficient because the police found cocaine and a receipt for a handgun in defendant's name, drugs were found in plain view and in close proximity to items owned by defendant, and defendant made a furtive gesture towards the officers. Finally, the court held that defendant's constitutional challenge to Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-6 was waived because defendant failed to raise the issue by motion to dismiss as required by Ind.

In affirming defendant's conviction, the appellate court noted that the record revealed that defendant and the victim were cohabiting and had an ongoing romantic relationship at the time of the incident. It was therefore reasonable for the trier of fact to infer that they lived together as if they were spouses, and the evidence was such that a reasonable trier of fact could have found defendant guilty of domestic battery beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an investment advisor and the company with which he was associated, sought interlocutory review of a partial summary judgment of the Allen Superior Court (Indiana), in a rescission action, ruling that a viatical settlement contract purchased by plaintiff investor (represented on appeal, after his death, by his personal representative) was a security as defined by Ind. Code &sect; 32-2-1-1(k) even before that statute was amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The viatical settlement contract (a contract under which the investor received the right to recover the proceeds of a life insurance contract after the terminally ill insured, who had already received discounted proceeds, died) purchased by the investor through the advisor had never been registered under the Indiana Securities Act. When the investor decided to rescind the contract for failure to register it, the advisor argued that viatical settlement contracts were not securities within the meaning of Ind. Code &sect; 23-2-1-1(k), offering as proof the fact that after the contract in question was signed, the statute had been amended to add viatical settlement contracts to the statutory list of investment contracts to be registered as securities. The appellate court held that the statutory list was illustrative rather than exhaustive and that the amendment simply clarified that viatical settlement contracts had always counted as investment contracts. Applying the Howey test of Indiana case law, the court found that such contracts satisfied all the elements of investment contracts, even the expectation of profits to be derived from entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father learned that the minor was about 20 weeks pregnant and had scheduled an abortion.

The appellate court concluded that only one parent's signature was required by statute. The appellate court noted that on its face, Ind. Code &sect; 16-34-2-4(a) provided that the consent of only parent or legal guardian was required in any circumstance. Thus, the state was precluded from requiring the consent of two parents for the minor to receive an abortion simply because the parents happened to be divorced with joint legal custody where that burden would not be imposed on the minor child of an intact family.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving on an Indiana highway when he disregarded a traffic signal and collided with a pickup truck. The pickup driver was ejected from his vehicle and died at the scene. Defendant's urine sample contained the metabolites for marijuana and cocaine. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 9-30-5-5 was unconstitutionally vague. The legislature clearly intended to broaden the scope of the respective statutes by sanctioning the use of urine screens to show metabolites in the &quot;body.&quot; The term &quot;body&quot; was not synonymous for the term &quot;blood.&quot; The court also rejected defendant's equal protection arguments. The legislature could have reasonably concluded that no level of Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substances could have been acceptably combined with driving a vehicle. Thus, it was rational for the legislature to impose the flat ban with regard to controlled substances while not imposing the same ban with regard to alcohol. The statute also had the effect of generally deterring illegal drug use, another legitimate government interest.

Even if the MMA were ambiguous, the two acts did not relate to the same general subject matter and were not in pari materia. Moreover, even if the MMA were ambiguous and in pari materia with the WDA, there was no need to harmonize the two acts because they did not conflict. Even if the MMA were ambiguous, in pari materia with the WDA, and in conflict with the WDA, the damages provisions of the MMA applied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, following a bench trial in the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), of battery, as a class D felony, and domestic battery, as a class A misdemeanor. Defendant appealed, challenging the admission of evidence, the sufficiency of the evidence, whether trial counsel was ineffective, and whether the trial court relied upon an improper aggravating circumstance in sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been living with his girlfriend for six to eight months when he struck her. The girlfriend told the police that upon returning to her apartment, and while holding her child, defendant began striking her in the face, pushed her onto a bed, and then jumped on the bed on top of them both and started punching her, causing her to lose consciousness. The victims never testified at trial, and defendant challenged the use of his girlfriend's statements as hearsay. The appellate court found that the statements were excited utterances, under Ind. R. Evid. 803(2). Defendant argued that the statements were made too long after the battery. Although no length of time between the battery and the statements was established, the facts established that the victim was still under the stress of the excitement caused by the beating. As for sentencing, the trial court improperly considered that one of the victims was under the age of 12 because being under the age of 14 was an element of battery that elevated it to a class D felony. Although the age of the victim was not a valid aggravator, other proper aggravators existed, and there was no reversible error in the sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">More than 10 years after conviction, defendant filed a petition for reduction of sentence under Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-17(b), seeking a four-year reduction of sentence. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) denied his petition. Defendant filed his notice of appeal and continued to litigate in the trial court. The trial court denied a motion to reconsider. Defendant's second motion to correct error was denied. The instant appeal ensued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant's notice of appeal was premature, all matters raised in his subsequent motions to correct error, namely, his constitutional claims, were before the court on appeal because the notice of appeal replaced the praecipe under Ind. R. App. P. 2(I). Given the clear precedent on the constitutional attacks defendant raised, the appellate court rejected his contention that Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-17(b) violated the separation of powers. The Indiana Supreme Court unambiguously held that, under Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-1-17(b), a court lacked jurisdiction to modify a defendant's sentence if more than 365 days elapsed since that defendant began serving his sentence and the prosecutor did not approve the modification. Also, there was no evidence in the record to show that the prosecutor adopted a &quot;blanket policy&quot; of denying any request for a sentence modification under &sect; 35-38-1-17(b). Without evidence in the record to support the factual allegation, any opinion examining the constitutionality of such a policy would have been purely advisory in nature. As the court did not render advisory opinions, the constitutional attack failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant various state officials sought review of the grant of a preliminary injunction by the Jennings Circuit Court (Indiana) based upon a request by appellee class which consisted of current and former patients of a state institution for developmentally challenged residents. The class members were characterized as &quot;medically frail&quot; and &quot;at risk&quot; individuals. The officials challenged the constitutionality of the injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Attorney General informed the officials that persons residing in or confined in the institution were being subjected to unacceptable conditions. The officials agreed to improve the conditions of the residents. The officials announced its intention to close the institution and transfer all patients to other types of facilities. Several parents and guardians of the patients examined the alternative facilities and determined they did not provide sufficient services. The trial court found that there was no evidence to show that any existing alternative facilities provided the same level of care and staffing as the institution. It further found that the injunction was necessary to maintain the status quo until such time as appropriate facilities were in existence. The appellate court held the evidence was sufficient to show the officials' transfer of patients deprived them of their rights of appropriate treatment. However, the trial court erred in forcing appropriation of funds to maintain staffing levels. The already transferred or discharged patients had to have the right to return. The injunction was vague as to prohibiting &quot;pressuring in any way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The trial court's provisions regarding staffing and &quot;pressuring&quot; of parents or guardians were clearly erroneous. On remand, they were to be stricken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee building owner sued appellant insurer, alleging breach of contract arising from the insurer's denial of the building owner's insurance claim. The building owner also alleged lack of good faith and fair dealing. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) granted summary judgment for the building owner, finding that the insurer breached the contract. A jury then returned a damages verdict for the building owner. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building owner claimed that damage to the building roof and damage to property in the building were covered by its policy. The insurer argued that the loss was excluded because the loss was due to wear and tear to the roof, decay, deterioration, and defective design. The insurer also claimed that the damage was not a &quot;collapse&quot; since the framing of the roof remained intact and functioning. The appellate court found that the term &quot;collapse&quot; was not defined in the policy. The modern trend was to hold that collapse coverage provided coverage if there was substantial impairment of the structural integrity of the building or a part of a building. Here, however, an adjuster testified that the sag in the roof was not a collapse. There was evidence that the weight of rain and the design of the roof caused the damage. Photos showed that the roof did not fall in, cave in, or lose its shape in any fashion. Most of the roof remained intact. Thus, the trial court's summary judgment was not based on uncontradicted facts as to whether there was a &quot;collapse&quot; within the meaning of the policy. Since there was a genuine fact issue, punitive damages could not have been awarded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer who executed the search warrant found on the desktop of defendant's personal computer an icon labeled &quot;Smoke.&quot; The officer opened the file and discovered it contained a letter relating to drug testing.

Defendant was charged with drug-related offenses and possession of child pornography. The trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence. The court affirmed. The court declined to determine whether the officer's affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause; even if it was insufficient, the evidence that defendant sought to suppress was admissible under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. The good faith of the police in relying on the search warrant satisfied the first requirement of the plain view doctrine, namely, that the initial intrusion was authorized under the Fourth Amendment. The pornographic images discovered after the issuance of the first warrant but before the second warrant were admissible under the plain view doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially charged on July 18th. At the initial hearing on July 20th the trial court set a jury trial date of October 23rd and set defendant's bond. Defendant was released on bond that day. After a series of motions, the case was re-docketed on May 6th of the following year. Another series of motions occurred including defendant's motion for discharge. The appellate court noted that when the trial court issued its order of dismissal on August 31st of the first year, the State had not moved to amend. Further, the State's subsequent motion to amend was withdrawn. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to discharge because he remained subject to the pre-trial order pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-34-1-4(d) until September of the following year. At the time the trial court ruled on defendant's motion for discharge based upon his right to a speedy trial, there remained 136 days for the State to try him within the 1-year period. Because none of the Barker factors weighed in defendant's favor, he was not deprived of his right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school corporation sought an interlocutory appeal of a decision by the Lake Superior Court (Indiana), which granted summary judgment to appellees, a property buyer and two encumbrancers, on the issue of whether the corporation was required to file a lis pendens notice in its condemnation action against appellee developer. Multiple motions for summary judgment had been filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation started condemnation proceedings against the developer after the developer refused to sell property to the corporation for a new school. The buyer purchased a portion of the subject property from the developer after the corporation had filed its condemnation complaint. Likewise, the encumbrancers took mortgages on the property after the filing of the condemnation complaint. The buyer and the encumbrancers were allowed to intervene in the condemnation action. They asserted that the order of appropriation and subsequent order of immediate possession did not affect their rights because the no lis pendens had been filed. The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment. The appellate court reversed. Although the general rule under the Lis Pendens Act, Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 34-34-1-1 to -9 (Supp. 1998-1999) was that a lis pendens was to be filed to give notice to subsequent purchasers, the Eminent Domain Act, Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 32-11-1-1 to -11 (1995), was an exception to the general rule. Nothing in the Eminent Domain Act required the filing of a lis pendens in a condemnation proceeding, nor was such a filing required under federal due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party sued defendants, the newspaper, a source, and others, for libel, slander, and defamation of character. The Laporte Superior Court (Indiana) granted summary judgment for all defendants but denied the source's petition for attorney's fees. The injured party and the source appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party argued that the newspaper was not entitled to an award of attorney's fees and costs under the anti strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) statute on the founds that the statute did not apply. The appellate court concluded that the injured party waived this objection by failing to raise it in response to the summary judgment motion. The source argued that the trial court improperly denied him attorney's fees because the fees and costs were paid by a non-party insurer. The appellate court concluded that the trial court's determination was an abuse of discretion. The appellate court held that the public policy underlying the anti-SLAPP statute dictated an award of attorney's fees to the source even when the source was not obliged to pay the fees. Finally, the source argued that the trial court improperly sanctioned him for a discovery violation without conducting a hearing and without giving him an opportunity to comply with the order compelling discovery. As the source failed to respond to the discovery requests for more than six months and Ind. R. Trial P. 37(D) did not mandate a hearing, the appellate court found no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The award of attorney's fees to the newspaper and the sanctions imposed on the source for failure to comply with discovery were affirmed. The denial of attorney's fees to the source was reversed and the case was remanded for a determination of the amount to which the source was entitled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient underwent Lasik surgery based on the recommendation of one of the doctors. After undergoing a variety of other procedures and seeing other doctors, the patient became aware that Lasik surgery should not have been performed on him because of his history of pre-existing cataracts and glaucoma. On appeal, plaintiffs argued that the trial court erred in determining that plaintiffs' complaint was filed outside the applicable statute of limitations. The appellate court held that the complaint was filed within the appropriate statute of limitations. The patient's diagnosis of a permanent vision loss, which occurred prior to the patient's becoming aware that Lasik surgery should not have been performed, did not give the patient a basis to reasonably suspect, based on more than mere suspicion or speculation, that malpractice had occurred. In addition, the appellate court noted that a plaintiff had to have a &quot;meaningful opportunity&quot; to pursue a malpractice claim; since only two months remained in the limitation period, it would have been a practical impossibility for plaintiffs to have asserted a timely claim.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 31-17-5-1 and 31-17-5-2(a), a court had discretion to grant visitation to grandparents. The trial court in the instant action found that neither parent was unfit. Moreover, the grandparents had substantial access to the child after the argument with the mother was resolved. The mother expressed no hesitation at allowing the grandparents to see the grandchild. The trial court found that the grandparents sought to have a relationship on their terms, without regard to the wishes of grandchild's parents.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon, aggravated battery, and being a habitual offender. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) sentenced him to 10 years for each of the B felonies, and enhanced the sentence for aggravated battery by 10 years. The trial court suspended four years of the enhanced 20-year sentence. The trial court denied defendant's motion to correct sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the sentence for aggravated battery was enhanced twice, first by operation of the aggravated battery statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-2-1.5 (2002), and then by application of the general habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-8 (2002). The appellate court ruled that, unlike the habitual traffic offender scheme and the handgun statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-47-2-3, the aggravated battery statute was a discrete and separate statute defining a single offense. Aggravated battery was, by definition, a Class B felony. Thus, defendant's conviction of aggravated battery as a Class B felony did not represent an elevation of a lesser classification of aggravated battery. There was no such offense. As a result, the imposition of a habitual offender enhancement did not represent a second enhancement of the aggravated battery offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a public utility announced plans to close several operating areas as a cost-savings measure, the LaPorte County Board of Commissioners and the City of Michigan City filed an emergency petition with the IURC asking it to prohibit the utility from implementing its plan and to conduct an investigation, and also sued the utility seeking an order enjoining it from implementing its plan.

Const. art. I, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a lesbian involved in a committed, five-year relationship with her domestic partner. When the domestic partner's father died, the employee requested three days of funeral leave pursuant to Ind. Admin. Code tit. 31, r. 1-9-7(B). The request was denied because the domestic partner was not the employee's spouse. The employee sued and after an initial reversal and remand, the trial court concluded that the policy did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it treated all unmarried persons the same. On appeal, the court held that Indiana's paid leave policy created a classification because it extended a privilege only to married employees. The employee, however, conceded that the policy was rationally related to marriage. Therefore, the court was not faced with the close question of whether the policy's marital status distinction was rational, but whether the privilege was equally available to all persons similarly situated. Although Ind. Code &sect; 31-11-1-1 prevented the employee from attaining privileged class status by prohibiting her from marrying her partner, she was not &quot;similarly situated&quot; to other married employees in the privileged class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, as treasurer of a county tourism bureau, controlled the check ledger and was responsible for depositing the bureau's funds. She failed to deposit $ 35,305 in cash receipts, and told an auditor she did not have or could not find documents the auditor requested.

She argued that the penalty for the knowing failure to deposit public funds -- 10 years -- violated the proportionality clause of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The appellate court disagreed. Classifying a knowing failure to deposit public funds as a Class B felony did not violate the Indiana Constitution's proportionality requirement, as the penalty for this offense did not shock public sentiment or violate the judgment of a reasonable people. The trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that it had a constitutional right to disregard the law, as it had no such right under Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19. Defendant failed to object to the trial court's decision requiring the jury to continue deliberating or be sequestered, and even if she had preserved this point for appeal the trial court's decision was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In connection with a complaint alleging that appellant nurse was unfit to practice due to a mental disability, appellee Indiana State Board of Nursing ordered him to submit to and pay for a psychiatric evaluation. The nurse filed suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The Marion County Court (Indiana) granted him summary judgment, but denied his request for attorney's fees. The Board appealed; the nurse appealed the denial of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's complaint was based on errors the nurse made, his falsification of a report, and his alleged statement that his errors might have been due to his reducing or discontinuing the use of his medications. Under Ind. Code &sect; 25-1-9-7, the Board could order him to submit to a mental exam if his mental capacity to practice safely was at issue in a disciplinary action. The appellate court held that, as the burden of proof rested with the State, and the Board could recoup the costs of the exam under Ind. Code &sect; 25-1-9-15 after disciplinary sanctions were imposed, but the nurse could not do so if he prevailed, the Board did not have statutory authority to impose costs before any determination of misconduct. Further, as the nurse had the right not to be sanctioned before it was determined that sanctions were appropriate, and the order requiring him to pay the costs of the exam was basically a sanction, such a requirement violated his due process rights. The trial court erred in ruling that immunity precluded assessing attorney's fees against the Board, as Congress intended for attorney's fees to be available in a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action even if damages were barred by immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which convicted him after trial to the court on two counts of operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of .10 percent or greater and causing death. He challenged the admissibility of blood alcohol evidence gathered in two different tests, one ordered by police and the other performed after hospital admission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first officers at the scene of a fatal accident ordered blood alcohol tests immediately, even before they had probable cause to suspect defendant was drunk. The sample was taken without his consent. The appellate court held that the statutory scheme of which the implied consent statute relating to fatal accidents was a part, at Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-7-2, provided civil penalties for refusal to consent to testing, but it did not authorize police to take a blood sample without obtaining a driver's consent, and the taking of a sample did not fall within the special needs administrative exception to the Fourth Amendment. The results of that first test were relied on to the exclusion of the results of the second test, taken by the hospital for diagnostic purposes after defendant's admission, so their admission was not harmless error. As Indiana drivers had no reasonable expectation of privacy in their blood alcohol results, however, the results of defendant's second test, to which he consented in obtaining treatment, were subject to disclosure under Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-6-6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction and remanded the matter for retrial, holding, for the trial court's guidance, that results of the second blood test would be admissible at the second trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found the employer and officers violated the employee's state and federal constitutional rights, but only awarded damages against the employer as to the state constitutional claims. The appellate court held the employee waived any inconsistency in the jury's verdict when it did not find the employer's liability as to the federal claims, as he did not object before the jury's discharge, despite an opportunity, and alleged an inconsistent, not inadequate, verdict. While his complaint stated constitutional issues, he challenged his termination's constitutionality, rather than the termination procedure's constitutionality, raising fact issues which might have been resolved by the employer's administrative procedures, which he had to exhaust. Failing to do so deprived the trial court of jurisdiction over his state law claims. As he waived objections to the verdict, the trial court had no jurisdiction over his state law claims, no damages were awarded for the federal violations, and his motion for reinstatement was denied, his legal relationship with the employer and the officers was not changed, so he did not prevail for purposes of attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that (1) photographs which depicted injuries to the victim, damage to his clothing, and the condition of the crime scene where his body was found were relevant to material issues in the case and to the testimony of a pathologist and the officer who found the victim's body; (2) testimony about defendant's prior involvement with drug dealing was relevant to show defendant's motive for wanting the victim killed; (3) the trial court did not err by requiring defendant to be present during the habitual offender phase of his trial or by allowing the State to call an attorney who represented defendant in a previous trial to identify him; and (4) Indiana's habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Ind.

The appellate court also addressed defendant's other issues for purposes of remand and concluded, inter alia, that denying defendant's requests for court-appointed experts was in error since defendant satisfied the Scott requirements for such appointment, and that the trial court erred when it permitted an expert, who had previously consulted with defense counsel to evaluate the case, to testify for the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a construction contractor and realtor, appealed from an order of the Howard Superior Court (Indiana), which denied their motion for summary judgment dismissing an action by plaintiff homeowner seeking damages for misrepresentation, fraud, and breach of implied warranty of habitability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner bought a four-bedroom house from the realtor associated with the contractor, in which, unknown to the homeowner, the contractor installed a septic system certified for a three-bedroom house. Years later, when problems occurred, he sued the contractor and realtor for fraud, misrepresentation, and breach of warranty. The appellate court held that the applicable septic system ordinance was not vague, overbroad, or lacking in rational basis. The homeowner had a private right of action, as he was suing for intentional wrongs, not for negligent noncompliance with the ordinance. The six-year statute of limitations was tolled until the homeowner actually discovered the system was nonconforming, and the fact that his fiancee had seen a copy of the original septic permit when she applied for a pool permit was not knowledge imputed to the homeowner. A purported disclaimer of warranty that did not comply with Ind. Code &sect; 32-27-2-9 was ineffective. Finally, even though one of five proffered experts who submitted affidavits in opposition to summary judgment was not shown to be qualified, there was still plenty of evidence supporting a finding of triable issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed an information, alleging that defendant committed murder. It then filed a second murder count, seeking the death penalty. Defendant moved to dismiss the death penalty count, which was granted. An interlocutory appeal was pending when defendant entered a guilty plea to one murder charge, and was sentenced. He petitioned for post-conviction relief, which was denied by the Elkhart Superior Court No. 1 (Indiana). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the post-conviction hearing, defendant sought to prove that he was induced to plead guilty by the dismissal of an illusory death penalty charge. In rejecting this argument, the appellate court found that the State was entitled to appeal the trial court's granting of defendant's motion to dismiss the death penalty count. In light of a strong dissent in the controlling case, and another state's refusal to follow the controlling case, the appellate court could not state that the State's appeal was frivolous. Therefore, defendant's guilty plea was not motivated by an improper or illusory threat. The prosecutor properly tested the applicability of a generally adverse precedent. The execution style and particularly callous nature of the killing, coupled with defendant's complete lack of remorse, his allegiance to a gang &quot;code&quot; over societal restraints, his juvenile record, and the likelihood that he would kill again, led the appellate court to the conclusion that the imposition of the maximum term of years was appropriate, and would have been imposed even in the absence of an impermissible aggravator. Even one valid aggravating circumstance was sufficient to support an enhancement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a patient and her spouse, sued appellee orthodontist in the Vandenburgh Superior Court (Indiana) for medical malpractice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient said the orthodontist's treatment injured her, but her complaint was not filed within two years of treatment, under Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1. The appellate court held &sect; 34-18-7-1 was an occurrence-based, not discovery-based, limitations statute. It imposed no impossible condition on the patient's access to the courts or ability to pursue a valid claim, so it was not unconstitutional as to her, nor did it shorten her time to file a claim so unreasonably that it was impractical to file a claim. Her position that the law was unsettled as to when the limitations period began was unsupported, and she had 9 to 11 months after discovery of the malpractice to file. Disagreement between the Indiana Department of Insurance and the orthodontist's insurer as to his status as a &quot;qualified health care provider&quot; did not justify a delay in filing. The orthodontist's alleged fraudulent concealment did not save the claim as it was untimely if concealment was passive.

A confidential informant advised an officer that he had purchased cocaine at a residence within the preceding 72 hours. The informant described the seller.

The seller testified that his permanent residence was not the particular residence that was searched. Thus, defendant challenged the warrant as unsupported by probable cause. The appellate court held that the place to be searched was described by address and by its physical appearance. The items to be seized were clearly specified. The officers were authorized to search the premises and curtilage of the particular address and to seize cocaine and related items. They conducted their search accordingly. Defendant was arrested not due to misapprehension that he was the seller. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owner sought a land use variance from appellant city to operate a residential treatment facility in an area zoned as single-family residential. The city's common council denied the request. The owner sought review from the Lake Superior Court, Civil Division (Indiana), which reversed and ordered approval of the variance. The city and appellants, a school city and public schools, sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of zoning appeals (BZA) conducted a hearing on the owner's proposed variance, and recommended that the council approve it. The council conducted a hearing and denied the request. The trial court held there was substantial evidence to meet the requirements for a land use variance set forth in Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-4-918.4, and that the council's hearing violated the owner's due process and equal protection rights. The appellate court held that the due process protections applied to BZA hearings by case law and Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-4-920 also had to apply to land use variance proceedings pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-4-918.6 (which applied only to two, populous, Indiana counties), in order to avoid a violation of Equal Protection and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The owner's due process rights were violated by an engineer's ex parte contact with the council and the failure of a council member (who worked for appellant public schools and had been pressured by her principal to deny the variance) to recuse herself. However, by granting the variance, the trial court gave insufficient deference to the council; it should have remanded for a new hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant health maintenance organizations (HMOs) sought declaratory relief, challenging the assessment methodology used by appellees, the Indiana Comprehensive Health Insurance Association (ICHIA) and the Indiana Insurance Commissioner. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The HMOs appealed the decision of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which dismissed their complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issues were whether the trial court properly dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and whether the ICHIA was an administrative agency within the province of the Indiana Administrative Orders and Procedures Act, Ind. Code &sect; 4-21.5-1-1 et seq. The appellate court concluded that the hallmarks of an administrative agency were absent. The ICHIA was a nonprofit legal entity to be referred to as the comprehensive health insurance association. This definition was inconsistent with that of an administrative agency--an entity that was responsible for any stage of a proceeding under the Act. The creation of the ICHIA was not accompanied by a regulatory scheme whereby the association was entrusted with enforcement of law. Rather, its purpose was to ensure health insurance availability for the otherwise uninsurable. Its essential function was cost allocation. The statutory scheme under which the ICHIA operated did not provide an exclusive administrative remedy. As such, the HMOs were not required to exhaust a statutory administrative remedy before filing their complaint for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the dismissal of the complaint against the ICHIA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose out of defendant's sale of a telephone services agreement. Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it found that his employment manual was inadmissible after a motion in limine. Defendant never tried to introduce the manual at trial and did not ask the trial court to revisit its ruling during trial. The appellate court ruled that in order to preserve error for appellate review, excluded evidence needed to be offered at trial. Defendant thus waived this issue. Defendant also argued that his right to confrontation was violated when a witness testified about an investigation performed by an investigator who was not called as a witness. However, since defendant elicited that testimony, it was invited error and he was not allowed to argue that it was reversible error. The jury was properly instructed.  Ind. Code &sect; 23-2-1-3 was not unconstitutionally vague. The fact that the Indiana Securities Commissioner filed a cease and desist order against defendant before criminal charges were filed against him did not render the State's decision to prosecute defendant for previous conduct a post hoc rationalization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the opening of a locked or unlocked door was sufficient to establish a breaking. The appellate court ruled that an instruction relating a mandatory presumption violated the Due Process Clause if it relieved the State of the burden of persuasion on a criminal element. The instruction here created a permissive inference, not a mandatory presumption. The giving of an impermissible mandatory instruction did not necessarily amount to reversible error where it was accompanied by an instruction informing the jury that it was the judge of the law and the facts. Instructions stating that certain evidence &quot;is&quot; sufficient to establish a criminal element should have been avoided, but, here, the jury was informed that it was the judge of the law and the facts, so there was no reversible error. Criminal trespass was a factually included lesser offense of residential entry here since the State alleged that defendant did knowingly break and enter his victim's dwelling, but all of the evidence pointed to a breaking, and so the trial court properly refused to give a jury instruction and verdict form on criminal trespass.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, grandparents of a minor child, filed a petition for grandparent visitation in the Jennings Circuit Court (Indiana) requesting a set visitation schedule with their grandson. The trial court granted the petition. Respondent mother appealed, raising two issues. She argued that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding visitation, and the Indiana Grandparent Visitation Act, Ind. Code &sect; 31-17-5-1 et seq., was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother gave birth to her son when she was 14 years old. Although the marriage dissolved, she and her son continued to have a good relationship with the grandparents, the father's parents. Visitation with the grandparents ceased after the child told his mother that he had been struck by the grandfather. After the grandparents filed a petition for visitation, the mother testified that her son consistently alleged that there was abuse at his grandparents' home. The special advocate's report recommended that visitation at the grandparents' home be continued, but that the grandfather should not be left alone with the child. After the trial court issued its order granting visitation, the appellate court found that the trial court failed to enter a decree setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court also failed to find that visitation was in the minor child's best interests. As such, the appellate court was unable to determine whether the trial court gave any weight to the notion that a fit parent would have acted in her child's best interests. Finally, the appellate court found that the Indiana Grandparent Visitation Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with resisting law enforcement, operating a vehicle while intoxicated, and failure to reduce speed for an emergency vehicle. The State filed a motion in limine to limit defendant's testimony concerning his knowledge of law enforcement misconduct. The court allowed defendant to testify, but limited the scope of his testimony. A jury in the Brown Circuit Court (Indiana) found defendant guilty as charged. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that he was prejudiced during jury selection because the trial court permitted the State to exercise a peremptory strike after it had passed on a juror. The court of appeals found no abuse of discretion in permitting the State to exercise its second peremptory strike since the facts and inferences showed that the request stemmed from an honest mistake, not from a mere change in choice. Defendant also challenged the trial court's resisting law enforcement jury instruction, alleging that it was contrary to law. The court of appeals found no error, noting that a lawful arrest was not a prerequisite to a conviction for resisting law enforcement. Finally, defendant challenged his conviction for driving while intoxicated, contending that there was scant objective evidence of intoxication and that the trial court unconstitutionally limited his ability to present his defense when it limited the scope of his testimony concerning his knowledge of police misconduct. The court of appeals concluded that the trial court properly balanced the probative value of the sought testimony with the potential prejudicial effect when it limited the scope of defendant's testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's psychiatrist opined that the employee's years of work with aluminum caused his early onset Alzheimer's.

They argued various points in defense, such as, that the employee never worked for the successor, that his claim was time-barred, and that their insurance carrier was not responsible for benefits awarded. The Indiana workers' compensation agency dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction, but did not append any factual findings. The appellate court held that unless the only question for it was a question of law, it could not review an order without the factual findings on which the order was based. There would be nothing to review. It therefore remanded the matter to the agency for the insertion of factual findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-8.5 improperly imposed a harsher penalty for reckless dealing in paraphernalia under Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-8.5(c) than for knowing or intentional dealing in paraphernalia under Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-8.5(a). The appellate court held Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 required penalties to be proportional to the nature of the offense and prohibited the penalty for a lesser-included offense from being greater than that for the greater offense. While a misdemeanor conviction under Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-8.5(c) required proof of a reckless mental state, there was not a proportionality problem when the offense was compared to Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-8.5(a), creating an infraction with a lesser penalty, because a mental state of &quot;knowingly&quot; or &quot;intentionally&quot; was not required as this was a strict-liability infraction not requiring proof of a mental state. The word &quot;intended&quot; in &sect; 35-48-4-8.5(a) did not define a culpable mental state required to prove a violation but, rather, modified &quot;raw material, an instrument, a device, or other object.&quot; Therefore, the penalties under &sect; 35-48-4-8.5 were constitutional because they were proportional to the nature of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was providing taxi services when he was shot by defendant and another man as they attempted to rob him. Afterwards, at the hospital, the victim told an officer and his wife what had happened. A couple of months later, the victim's trach tube became blocked by mucous and he subsequently died. Defendant asserted an intervening cause, hospital negligence, killed the victim. The appellate court held the victim had been subjected to a startling event. Thus, the statements were excited utterances and admissible. Because defendant suggested the victim's death was due to an intervening cause, the cause of death was relevant and the statements by the medical examiner as to why some of the victim's organs were not able to be harvested due to gunshots were relevant. The jury instructions, when read together, required that intent to participate had to be proven. Any problems that occurred with the trach tube were the result of the hospitalization and treatment necessitated by the gunshot injuries. Thus, the use of the trach tube was not extraordinary and not an intervening cause. Defendant's sentence of 65 years was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an independent contractor and his spouse, appealed from a judgment of the Monroe Circuit Court (Indiana), which entered summary judgment in favor of defendant lumber companies in plaintiffs' product liability and negligence action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The independent contractor cut himself against the edge of the wood, which had been treated with a heavy metal compound that included arsenic. The contractor suffered various incidents of cellulitis, some requiring hospitalization and medication, over a period of years. After speaking with an attorney and a doctor, the contractor determined that the treated wood caused the health problems. The contractor and his wife commenced an action, which was resolved by summary judgment in favor of defendants upon a finding that the claims were time-barred. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the action was timely filed under Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1 because it was filed within two years of being told of the proximate cause of the product to his injury. The court noted that the contractor's prior mere suspicion that the wood may have caused the health problems was not sufficient to start the running of the limitations period. His prior doctors never informed him that the wood caused the problem, only that there were chemicals in there, and his treatment with antibiotics would not have caused a reasonable person to further investigate if there was a viable cause of action at that time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, was charged with battery and pointing a gun. Defendant entered a denial as to the charges. Defendant filed a notice of alibi defense and a request for visitation by an investigator and polygraph examiner. Access was granted for the investigator only. Defendant was found guilty. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) granted wardship to the department of corrections and recommended commitment for 12 months. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over him because a summons was not issued pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 31-37-12-2(b). The appellate court found no error since defendant and his parents fully submitted themselves to the authority of the court. Defendant also argued that the trial court improperly denied his request for access to a polygraph examiner. The appellate court found no error, noting that defendant failed to demonstrate how lack of access to such an examination prejudiced his defense. Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion when it detained him for over four months during the pendency of the proceedings. The appellate court agreed, after finding ample evidence demonstrating that defendant's parents were willing to go to great lengths so that defendant could be released to their care. Defendant also argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his finding of delinquency. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the testimony was sufficient to support the trial court's findings. Finally, the appellate court upheld the trial court's sentence since, inter alia, there was evidence of defendant's increasingly violent nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The finding that defendant was delinquent was affirmed. The case was remanded for a clarification of the dispositional order to reflect that defendant would be given credit for his time served prior to the disposition hearing against his recommended period of commitment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of domestic battery, in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-2-1.3 (2002). Following the entry of judgment, by the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), defendant appealed, arguing that Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-2-1.3 (2002) was unconstitutionally vague and that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of that portion of the domestic battery statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-2-1.3 (2002), that required him to live or to have lived &quot;as if a spouse&quot; of the victim. He argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because the statute did not define what that phrase meant, and no one could know with any reasonable degree of confidence whether they were or had lived with another &quot;as if a spouse.&quot; The appellate court addressed the statute's constitutionality, even though defendant did not file a motion to dismiss prior to trial, under Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-34-1-6, 35-34-1-4 (1998). In addressing the constitutionality issue, the appellate court found that the only evidence presented on the matter of living &quot;as if a spouse&quot; was that defendant and the victim had lived together in the past and had a sexual relationship. Only living in the same home and having a sexual relationship did not equate one to being a spouse. Therefore, the challenged portion of the domestic battery statute was unconstitutionally vague, as applied to defendant. On remand, the trial court was not precluded from entering a conviction and judgment on a charge of battery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant non-member employees appealed from an order of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff public employees' union in an action to recover fair share dues. The employees argued that Ind. Exec. Order No. 90-6 and the First Amendment precluded collection of such dues from them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although Ind. Exec. Order No. 90-6 contained general right-to-work language regarding the rights of state employees who decided not to join a union, Ind. Exec. Order No. 97-29 specifically incorporated a settlement between the state and the union that provided for fair share dues. The appellate court held that since the earlier executive order did not explicitly forbid fair share dues, they were permissible. The appellate court then looked to whether the union had satisfied its burden, under the First Amendment, to establish that the fair share amount accurately reflected those types of expenses that were properly chargeable to non-members. Even though the union had not presented documentary evidence in the form of its officials' and employees' time cards, the appellate court held that the union had carried its burden as to most expenses. It had not, however, established the chargeability of the proportion of administrative expenses that it imposed on non-members, nor of the proportion of contributions to the international union that it passed on.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment in part, but remanded the matter for further proceedings regarding the proportion of administrative expenses and funds passed on to the union international that were properly chargeable to non-members.</SPAN></P>

The doctor moved for summary judgment, asserting that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The doctor's motion was denied, but the Allen Circuit Court (Indiana) granted summary judgment for the doctor on the issue of negligence. The doctor appealed. The patient cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor performed a hysterectomy on the patient. During surgery, the doctor also removed skin tags from her vaginal area, without her consent. The surgery occurred near the patient's clitoris. The doctor denied operating near her clitoris. The patient did not find out until two years later that the doctor had operated near her clitoris. On appeal, the doctor argued that the trial court erred when it determined that there was an issue of fact regarding whether the doctor had fraudulently concealed the fact that he had performed surgery near the patient's clitoris. In her complaint, the patient had alleged both active and constructive concealment because the doctor denied cutting anywhere near her clitoris, the location of the discomfort. The court of appeals concluded that despite the evidence of concealment, the patient did not timely bring the action because she experienced, almost immediately after the surgery, symptoms that should have led to the discovery of the removal of the skin tags. The doctor's denial that he operated near the patient's clitoris did not change the fact that the patient experienced discernible symptoms. Thus, the statute of limitations was not tolled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an insurance agent, appealed the judgment of the Kosciusko Circuit Court (Indiana) that granted the motion of plaintiffs, two investors who were husband and wife, for summary judgment in an action for rescission of a contract. The investors filed suit to recover the money paid to an investment group, contending that the sale of viatical settlement contracts (VSC) violated the Indiana Securities Act, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 23-2-1-1 to -24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The investors contended that the agent violated Ind. Code &sect; 23-2-1-19 by selling securities without following the requirements of the Act, specifically that the VSCs were not registered as securities, and the agent was not a registered seller of securities. The appellate court found that a VSC was, at the time, considered to be a security under Ind. Code &sect; 23-2-1-1(k), but was not included in the earlier statutory definition of &quot;security&quot; at the time of the sale to the investors. The appellate court found, however, that there was no dispute that the agent's viatical settlement sales involved the investment of money in a common enterprise, or that the investors invested their money with the reasonable expectation of profits. It was the activities by the capital group and the agent that affected the success or failure of the enterprise, even if those activities may have been pre-purchase. Further, the agent did not contend that he was unaware of the facts surrounding the transaction, merely that he was unaware that the law attached any regulations to the facts as they existed. The appellate court found that this did not constitute an affirmative defense under Ind. Code &sect; 23-2-1-19.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner sued defendants, a judge, a deputy prosecuting attorney, a county sheriff, a probation officer, and an attorney, alleging civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 based upon, inter alia, the issuance of an arrest warrant. The Sullivan Superior Court (Indiana) granted defendants' motions to dismiss and denied the prisoner's motion to correct error. The prisoner appealed from the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was arrested for violating his probation and his probation was revoked. The court affirmed the revocation of probation. A federal court dismissed the prisoner's civil rights claims for failure to comply with the federal pleading rules. A second federal case was dismissed for untimeliness. In the instant case, the appellate court determined that the relevant statute of limitations barred the prisoner's civil rights action and the &quot;continuing wrong&quot; and &quot;fraudulent concealment&quot; doctrines did not make the action timely. Also, Indiana's Journeys Account Statute did not save the late-filed state complaint, because the federal claims failed due to the prisoner's negligence. In addition, the appellate court determined that Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-50-6-5(a)(4) (West 2002), which deprived the prisoner of credit time due to the frivolous lawsuit, was not vague or overbroad, and it did not violate due process or equal protection principles. Also, the trial court did not err in finding that the prisoner's claims were frivolous. Finally, the trial court did not err in declining to appoint counsel to represent the prisoner on the frivolous claims.</SPAN></P>

The Boone Superior Court (Indiana) entered summary judgment in favor of the district. The recycling facility appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recycling facility argued that under the Home Rule Act, Ind. Code ch. 36-1-3, the district's power to regulate its facility was preempted by state law. The appellate court found that the district had the power to prescribe requirements for the permitting and operation of solid waste facilities. Also, the general assembly did not place any limits on a district's power that would have prevented it from creating a permit system. The permit system did not violate Ind. Code &sect; 13-21-3-14 and the district's authority to establish a permit system was not preempted. The district had the authority to institute a permit system and to regulate solid waste facilities. It was a denial of due process if an agency received ex parte evidence. There was evidence of ex parte communication from the public. There was no evidence that the recycling facility was made aware of the ex parte communications. The district also needed to show that its decision was not based on the ex parte evidence, and summary judgment was improper where resolution hinged on state of mind, credibility of witnesses, and weight of the testimony. Therefore, summary judgment was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that the district had the authority to issue permits for the operation of solid waste facilities was affirmed. The judgment was otherwise reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings to determine whether the receipt of ex parte communications during the application process resulted in prejudicial error and to consider the recycling facility's challenges to the permit provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of molesting a six-year-old girl. Defendant argued that the child's testimony, without more, was insufficient to support the conviction. Defendant argued that the &quot;incredible dubiosity rule&quot; should have been invoked to reverse the conviction. The appellate court ruled that the &quot;incredible dubiosity rule&quot; allowed a reversal when a sole witness gave contradictory testimony that was equivocal, or the result of coercion, and there was a lack of circumstantial evidence of guilt. A conviction was allowed to stand on a minor's uncorroborated testimony. A conviction for child molesting was to be sustained when it was apparent that the child victim described an act of sexual penetration. A child's inconsistent statements did not make her testimony inherently improbable or incredibly dubious. The incredible dubiosity rule did not apply, and there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction. Probation restrictions on defendant's contact with children, his use of a computer, and the requirement that he report any dating or sexual relationships were proper. The restriction on possession of pornography, however, was unreasonably vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal from an order of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which denied his motion to dismiss a criminal information against him alleging reckless possession of paraphernalia under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-48-4-8.3 (West 1998), based on his challenge to its constitutionality due to his claim of disproportionality of the penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer saw defendant fighting with another individual. Defendant appeared intoxicated and a search incident to the arrest revealed a crack pipe which tested positive for cocaine residue. Defendant sought dismissal of the information against him, alleging that &sect; 35-48-4-8.3 was unconstitutional. The trial court denied his motion and on appeal, the court affirmed that denial, holding that although the term &quot;recklessly&quot; as used in &sect; 35-48-4-8.3(c) was ambiguous, it was interpreted within constitutional limits. The court differentiated the offenses described in &sect; 35-48-4-8.3(a), (c), in their character of the possession and in the nature of the object possessed. In &sect; 35-48-4-8.3(a), the person's intent was the critical element of the offense, whereas in &sect; 35-48-4-8.3(c), the focus was on the nature of the object itself. Likening the interpretation of &quot;recklessly&quot; to that given to the term in Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-41-2-2, the court held that &quot;recklessly&quot; possessing an object was more culpable than possessing it &quot;intentionally.&quot; The court concluded that &sect; 35-48-3-8.3(a) was a lesser-included offense of &sect; 35-48-3-8.3(c) and that there was no violation of Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of a schedule II controlled substance. Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence. The Jennings Circuit Court (Indiana) denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court should have granted her motion to suppress because the affidavit did not connect the drugs purchased to the premises to be searched; thus, there was insufficient information to establish probable cause to search defendant's house. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court of appeals found that the affidavit did not sufficiently set forth facts then in the affiant's knowledge to constitute probable cause to search the house. The affidavit did not link defendant's alleged purchase with the premises, and there was no evidence that she had any connection with the described premises. Thus, there was no basis for a reasonably prudent person to believe that a search of the premises would uncover evidence of a crime. The State argued that defendant's motion was properly denied because the evidence was admissible under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. The court of appeals concluded that no reasonable officer could have relied on the search warrant affidavit in good faith. The affidavit on which the search warrant was based was so facially lacking in indicia of probable cause that the good faith exception did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimant was injured while working for defendant employer. She left employment because of personal difficulties with a co-worker. Following various workers' compensation and civil proceedings, a hearing was held before a hearing member. Limited disability benefits were awarded and no bad faith was found. The claimant appealed, and the decision was affirmed by judgment of the Indiana Workers' Compensation Board. The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant asserted that she was entitled to temporary partial disability benefits (TPD) because her employer did not offer her any work in accordance with her ability to perform sedentary work. The appellate court found that the issue had not been preserved. Also, because the claimant voluntarily terminated her employment due to reasons unrelated to her work injury, the employer did not have a duty to offer her work according to medical restrictions or to remit any TPD benefits to her. Thus, the Board properly determined that the claimant was unavailable for work for reasons that were not related to her work injury. The medical report of the insurer's doctor was properly admitted into evidence, even though the doctor did not physically examine the claimant. The report met the requirements of Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-2-6(e). There was no need for the insurer's doctor to comment on any impairment, for he determined that the claimant's injuries were not related to her work. There was absolutely no evidence that the insurer acted in bad faith when denying certain benefits. There was substantial competent evidence of probative value to support the Board's decision.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 1, &sect; 13(a). Defendant argued that the State was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that venue resided in Hamilton County. The appeals court held that the uncontroverted evidence showed that defendant's offenses occurred wholly in Marion County because the two eastbound lanes of 96th Street were fully in Marion County, and defendant never left the eastbound lanes and never even fully crossed into the northern eastbound lane. Thus, the State failed to prove that venue properly resided in Hamilton County, and the trial court erred by failing to grant defendant's motion for judgment on the evidence at the end of the State's case-in-chief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff beer distributors appealed from a Marion Superior Court (Indiana) summary judgment in favor of defendants, the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission (ATC) and a brewing company, declaring that a rule of the Commission had expired under the Indiana Sunset Law, Ind. Code &sect; 4-22-2.5-2 (2002), and that if the distributors shipped outside their contractual territories, they would be in breach of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Former Ind. Admin. Code tit. 905, r. 1-28-1(3) (1979) (Rule 28) prohibited beer distributors in Indiana from having exclusive territories. Therefore, even though distributors' contracts with brewers assigned particular territories, they engaged in a practice called transshipping, under which they also distributed beer in other wholesalers' territories. When Rule 28 expired under the Sunset Law, after the ATC declined to readopt it, a brewer notified certain distributors that they would have to stick to their own territories in future. The appellate court held that Rule 28 had indeed expired by operation of law. Therefore, no administrative action was required to repeal it, and the expiration did not amount to revocation of the distributors' permits without proper procedures. Further, in the interests of judicial economy, the trial court had not erred in declaring that the distributors would be in breach of contract if they were to continue transshipping.</SPAN></P>

The OFC established by clear and convincing evidence the requisite elements to support the termination of the mother's parental rights. The evidence most favorable to the judgment disclosed that the mother was historically unable to provide adequate housing and supervision for her children. One of the children, aged 10, had contracted gonorrhea after sexual involvement with another child. The mother had sporadically resided with a relative, with the father, in shelters, motels, a vehicle, and jail and was chronically unemployed. The conditions leading to the children's removal were probably not going to change, and termination was in the children's best interests. Under Ind. R. Trial P. 59(J)(7), the trial court's order on its sua sponte motion to correct error was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner putative father appealed from a judgment of the Clay Circuit Court (Indiana) granting a motion by respondent prospective adoptive parents to dismiss his paternity action for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney for the prospective adoptive parents wrote a letter to the putative father. Although it was not strictly compliant with the Indiana pre-birth notice statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 31-19-3-4, the letter told the father of the mother's hope that the parents would adopt the expected child, enclosed a copy of Ind. Code &sect; 31-19-9-15, which explained what the father needed to do to avoid an implication of consent to adoption, and warned him to rely only on the statute. The appellate court held that the letter substantially complied with the notice statute, because it told the father exactly what he needed to do and what the consequences of inaction would be. Instead of filing a paternity action within 30 days, as the statute directed, the father commenced DNA testing, without indicating any desire to be involved with the child. The appellate court held that the implied consent statute was a nonclaim statute, not subject to equitable defenses, and noted that it had already been held not to violate due process. Therefore, since the father had not acted to timely preserve his paternity claim, Indiana's courts were without jurisdiction to hear it.</SPAN></P>

At sentencing the four convictions of neglect of a dependent were merged into the murder convictions of the children, and she was sentenced to 215 years by the Morgan Superior Court (Indiana). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's theory was that defendant was attempting to commit suicide when she drove her vehicle down the wrong side of a highway at over 90 miles per hour. Defendant argued that the State's action of amending its witness list to include 22 new witness three weeks prior to the scheduled trial forced her to request a continuance. In rejecting defendant's speedy trial claim, the appellate court found that the State did not delay in providing its amended witness list. Rather, it timely disclosed the amended list in accordance with the trial court's deadline. The appellate court would not say that the trial court abused its discretion by finding that defendant could have been prepared for trial without the continuance and by attributing the delay resulting from the continuance to defendant. Evidence of defendant's prior drug dealing was highly relevant to the issue of defendant's state of mind. The State theorized that this provided motivation to commit suicide, as she was afraid she was under investigation and would be arrested. No circumstantial evidence instruction was necessary because there was direct as well as circumstantial evidence linking defendant to the crimes.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 29-1-2-12.1, because the insured could never be convicted of his wife's murder, and, further, no constructive trust arose under equitable principles either, because the policy always belonged to the insured, and he acquired no new right by killing his wife. Thus, the slayer's rule of case law had no application. As the contingent beneficiaries had not committed any wrongful act in connection with the death, their right was clear.</SPAN></P>

The accounting firm filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the action was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in Indiana's Accountancy Act, codified at Ind. Code &sect; 25-2.1-15-2. The Lake Circuit Court (Indiana) denied the accounting firm's motion, and the accounting firm appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation hired an accounting firm to prepare its tax returns. The firm prepared the corporation's state personal property tax returns from 1987 through 1992, and although it did not complete state personal property tax returns after 1992, it provided other services, including the preparation of federal and state income tax returns, until May 1995. While preparing the corporation's state personal property tax returns, the accounting firm failed to note that the corporation was entitled to take a tax exemption on an industrial waste control facility it operated, and, as the exemption was not claimed, the corporation paid approximately $ 168,000 in personal property taxes it could have avoided. In 1997, the corporation sued the accounting firm, alleging negligence. The appellate court held that: (1) the statute of limitations set forth in Indiana's Accountancy Act, codified at Ind. Code &sect; 25-2.1-15-2, was not unconstitutional; (2) the facts did not establish constructive fraud, a continuing wrong, or fraudulent concealment, and the corporation could not use those doctrines to toll the statute of limitations; and (3) the corporation's action was untimely under &sect; 25-2.1-15-2.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the contractor's petition in part and ordered the property owners to remove their sign and not to replace it. The appellate court held that (1) Ind. Const. art.

On appeal, defendant argued that because he was not in a public place at the time of his arrest, he did not commit the offense of public intoxication. The appellate court ruled that a public place included a place open to common and general use and accessible to the public. The hotel hallway was a public place for purposes of Ind. Code &sect; 7.1-5-1-3. Also, that statute adequately advised the public of the proscribed conduct and was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad as applied. Defendant's challenge to the special deputy statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 36-8-10-10.6(a), was not clear and was unsupported by authority. Defendant was not unlawfully detained nor evicted. While the cost of transcript preparation was high, the cost did not infringe upon defendant's right to appeal. The court reporter's failure to transcribe voir dire and opening and closing statements was reasonable and did not infringe on defendant's constitutional right to appeal. There was sufficient evidence to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two cases consolidated for trial, the Madison Circuit Court (Indiana) convicted defendant in a battery case of possession of cocaine, battery by body waste, resisting law enforcement, battery resulting in bodily injury, and unlawful use of body armor, all as Class D felonies, and in a forgery case, after defendant's guilty plea, of seven counts of forgery, and sentenced defendant to a total of 10 years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was restrained and taken to the hospital after, what the trial court characterized as, bizarre, unexplainable, and inexcusable circumstances. Defendant had taken cocaine, was locked in his house, was incoherent, pointed a gun at officers, resisted arrest, had a bulletproof material sewn into his shirt, and wanted police to kill him to complete his suicide attempt. Defendant was taken to a hospital for treatment. The appeals court, in affirming the convictions and sentences, found that defendant's counsel was not ineffective. The trial court's intoxication instructions under Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 31-41-2-5, 31-41-3-5 were correct; voluntary intoxication was not a defense. The bodily armor statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-47-5-13, was not unconstitutionally vague under the case's actual facts. With respect to sentencing, the seven concurrent four-year forgery sentences were suspended and were within Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-6 limits. Defendant's character, extensive juvenile record, adult record, and the cases' circumstances were aggravating factors to support enhancements to consecutive sentences and to maximum sentences. Defendant received a benefit for his guilty pleas to forgery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner refused to pay a mandatory recycling fee. The appellate court held the fee was a payment for recycling services associated with the costs of the services and was uniformly imposed upon residential property owners. While it was compulsory, it was a fee and not a tax. The resolution adopting the fee did not violate Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 due to the fact that, under Ind. Code &sect; 13-21-3-12(17), it did not apply to a municipality unless the municipality adopted it. The resolution applied equally to all citizens living in the municipality and was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of the policy of home rule. The resolution's exemption of certain property owners did not violate Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 because it was uniformly applicable to all property owners and was a legitimate exercise of legislative line-drawing based on the fiscal considerations of the difficulty of implementing a program applicable to rental complexes over four units. The resolution was authorized by the district's broad power under Ind. Code &sect; 13-21-3-12 to do all things necessary for the reduction, management, and disposal of solid waste.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer had &quot;entered&quot; computer chat rooms on the internet and portrayed himself as a child, available to be solicited for sex by adults. Defendant engaged in internet conversation with the officer and ultimately made inquiries indicative of whether the officer would like to have sex. When defendant arrived at a location to meet the officer he was arrested. The appellate court held the fact that it was not actually possible for defendant to solicit a child because the officer was not a child, did not bar his conviction for an attempted child solicitation. The appellate court did not find that the trial court committed reversible error in allowing the State to amend the information six days before trial of a charge that had been pending for over six months. The admission of a printout of the internet conversations was not an abuse of discretion. The trial court's instruction implicitly covered the substance of defendant's proposed instruction. Defendant's sentence required remand since that which could not be used to enhance a sentence could not be used to balance circumstances that could properly serve to reduce the sentence as mitigators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant's conviction was affirmed, but his sentence was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for resentencing of defendant to less than the presumptive sentence.</SPAN></P>

The Elkhart Superior Court (Indiana) denied appellants' motion for preliminary determination as to the statute of limitations. The doctor and the foundation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the trial court erred by not finding in their favor on their motion for a preliminary determination as to the malpractice statute of limitations. Appellees argued that the malpractice statute of limitations was unconstitutional as applied to them. The court of appeals concluded that, looking at the totality of the circumstances giving rise to this claim, it was a practical impossibility for the patient to assert her claim before the expiration of the limitation period and that rigid application of the occurrence-based statute would deny her the meaningful opportunity to pursue her claim. The court of appeals noted that the patient did not have the requisite information to determine that she had a medical malpractice claim until she received the news that she had cancer, which was more than two years after the alleged malpractice occurred. Accordingly, the court of appeals agreed with the trial court that that patient's claim was not barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a firefighter initially flunked a random drug test, he elected to participate in an employee assistance program that enabled him to remain employed.

When he failed a follow-up test, administered as part of the voluntary program, he was fired. The appellate court upheld the action, finding no arbitrariness and no constitutional violations, given the safety-sensitive nature of his job. Expungement of employee records was a discretionary remedy, narrowly applied. The firefighter was granted all the other relief he sought from the original determination, but he elected to become subject to further testing when he enrolled in the program. When he failed the second test, he was not deprived of his position without notice and a hearing, but he was not entitled to relitigate all the circumstances of the original test.</SPAN></P>

In all other zones, a family was defined to include a group of no more than five adults and their dependent children living together as a single housekeeping unit. The city filed a complaint against a property owner and five people who were unrelated to him after it learned they were living together in the same dwelling unit. The appellate court held that (1) the acts of the city through its zoning authority were state action subject to the equal privileges and immunities clause of the Indiana Constitution, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23; and (2) because the ordinance was based on mere planning premises without any documented support in professional literature and there was no evidence showing that the classification created by the ordinance was reasonable or substantial, the ordinance violated art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction of promoting prostitution and sentence to five years' imprisonment after a bench trial in the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), after, on the morning of the trial, the State was permitted to amend the information against him, and he was denied a continuance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in permitting the amendment to the charging document, as the State deleted one of the alternate bases for defendant's conviction. The amendment did not affect the availability of defendant's defense or the applicability of evidence that existed under the original information. The evidence was sufficient to convict defendant, as he screened the patron, a police officer, arranged the meeting, allowed the patron to inspect the prostitute prior to striking a deal, accepted part of the money himself, and encouraged a sexual encounter by offering to sell the patron condoms when the patron suggested that he needed them. Defendant's sentence did not violate the state constitution's proportionality clause, even though the range of permitted sentences for a prostitution promoter was longer than the sentencing range for prostitution. There was nothing incongruous or unfair about the legislature's decision to punish the two crimes differently. In light of the presumption of constitutionality of statutes, defendant failed to meet the heavy burden on a party asserting unconstitutionality of the sentencing statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient and his wife claimed that surgery on the patient was done negligently and caused the patient's reflex sympathetic dystrophy to advance. The complaint was filed more than four years after the surgery. The patient and his wife argued that because they did not learn of the possibility of the alleged malpractice until much later, when they met with another doctor, they had two years thereafter to file their complaint. The appellate court held that Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1(b) (1998) required the filing of a malpractice action within two years of the occurrence. The case did not pass the first stage of the Rogers and Shah analysis. The patient's worsened and worsening symptoms would have led a reasonably diligent person to have discovered the alleged malpractice and resulting injury. The patient and his wife were aware within several months after the surgery that the pain had increased and spread. Within two years of his surgery, and clearly within two years of his last visit to the health care providers, the patient and his wife had enough information that a reasonably diligent person should have discovered the alleged malpractice claim.</SPAN></P>

The commission was obligated to grant the application when the application satisfied the subdivision control ordinance. The denial of the application on the basis of factors outside the ordinance was erroneous. Speculation about unspecified possibilities did not constitute a factual finding.

The appellate court found that affidavits presented by the passenger were based on inadmissible statements. Documents attached to the affidavit were inadmissible as well. Summary judgment affidavits needed to be made on personal knowledge. The passenger's injuries resulted from the motorist's mistake in judgment rather than from wanton or willful misconduct. The appellate court declined to review the passenger's claims that the Guest Statute was unconstitutional, as she had the opportunity to raise this issue to the trial court but failed to do so. Challenges to the constitutionality of a civil statute could be waived if they could have been raised to the trial court, but the passenger failed to do so.

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was on the porch of a house with a history of narcotics activity. When an officer approached people outside the house, defendant looked at the officer, ran into the house, and out the back door. Defendant ran to a different house. The officer was given permission by the owner to enter the other house and, inside, found a gun. The appellate court found that with these facts, the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe defendant was involved in criminal activity. Defendant was not an overnight guest, but merely present in the other house with the owner's permission. Defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy and lacked standing to challenge the search. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a bifurcated trial. Since the gun was in plain view and close to other items associated with defendant, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer that defendant was in constructive possession of the gun. The classification of the serious violent felon statute as a Class B felony was not unconstitutional. The trial court properly weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and found that a 15-year sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a review of an administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision sought by appellants, telecommunications corporation and its affiliates, appellee Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) held that the scope of the telecommunications corporation's operating support system (OSS) test was to be expanded to include a test of its digital subscriber lines' (DSL) resale offerings. The telecommunications corporation and its affiliates appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The telecommunications corporation needed to comply with a 14-point list as a part of its request to enter the long distance telephone market. One point on the list was whether the telecommunications corporation's services were properly available for resale. The telecommunications corporation asked the IURC to review a test of its OSS to determine if it was in compliance with the list. The ALJ expanded the scope of the OSS testing to include DSL resale performance measurements. The telecommunications corporation argued that its DSL service was not a telecommunications service as contemplated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Act). The appellate court held that an agency and a court needed to give effect to the expressed intent of Congress, which was that all telecommunications markets be open to competition. The purpose of the Act was to ensure that incumbent local exchange carriers did not use their control over local exchanges to squeeze out competitors. The possibility of anticompetitive pricing for DSL services was real. The IURC's order was proper. The appellate court also found that the IURC had proper jurisdiction and that its order did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 34-51-3-6 required that clerks of court collect punitive damages awards, and that they be paid 25 percent to the successful plaintiff and 75 percent to the state's victim compensation fund. The former wife's award of damages for her former husband's violation of privacy and intentional infliction of extreme emotional distress for distributing nude pictures of her was designated half compensatory and half punitive. The appeals court held that there was no unconstitutional taking, because there was no right to punitive damages, and they could be abolished altogether. The statute did, however, violate the particular services clause of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, because attorneys provided services that no one else could provide, citizens had a right to access, and when the extra effort needed to win an award of punitive damages went unrewarded because the client lacked the funds for an extra fee, the services had been provided without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

In September 1994, a third doctor informed the patient that her rectal muscles had been irreparably severed during the laser surgery performed the doctor in 1990. The trial court properly found that the patient's case was barred the two-year statute of limitations under Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1. In January 1992, at the latest, the patient discovered facts that, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have led to the discovery of the malpractice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child's maternal grandmother filed an action against her son-in-law after he asked her to spend as many hours at his home visiting her grandson as her grandson spent visiting her at her home.

The child's mother died when he was six years old, however, and after her death the relationship which existed between the child's father and the child's maternal grandmother deteriorated. The appellate court held that the trial court had properly considered the lack of evidence that the child's father was an unfit parent, the presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children, and the fact that the father was not barring his mother-in-law from visiting her grandson under all circumstances, and had correctly determined that court-ordered visitation was not in the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-48-4-14.5 and allow one to be subjected to criminal liability for possession of the ingredients of methamphetamine, but to not be liable if the ingredients were used to manufacture the finished product. One could not commit the felony of manufacturing methamphetamine without possessing at least some hazardous substances; without using, pouring, and mixing those substances, or without applying heat. Thus, manufacturing methamphetamine, by its very nature, could not be committed without creating a substantial risk that someone would be killed. There was sufficient evidence that defendant was guilty of dealing in a schedule II controlled substance, even if the evidence did not support a finding he manufactured the methamphetamine for a purpose other than his own use. Because of the substantial evidence against defendant, the prejudicial effect of the testimony about the contents of a note written to his ex-wife was minimal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An Indiana sheriff's department's internal personnel procedures provided that officers who met certain qualifications could be placed on an eligibility list for promotion to sergeant.

An officer barely achieved the requisite examination score for promotion and met the other requirements, but the merit commission decided his name should be kept off the eligibility list because of his extensive disciplinary history. The appeals court held that the officer failed to show violation of a protected property interest within the meaning of the due process requirements of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ind. Const. art.

The trial court then awarded costs and prejudgment interest on the judgment amount. After the trial court denied her motion to correct errors, the negligent motorist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to trial, the injured person and her husband had made a written settlement demand for $ 25,000 pursuant to the Tort Prejudgment Interest Statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 34-51-4-1 to -9. The demand was rejected. The negligent motorist claimed that the Tort Prejudgment Interest Statute was unconstitutionally vague and violated her due process rights. In the alternative, the negligent motorist claimed that the trial court erred in its award of prejudgment interest under the statute. The negligent motorist had not raised this issue to the trial court before filing the motion to correct errors, and the appellate court ruled that this issue was therefore waived on appeal. The Tort Prejudgment Interest Statute contained no exception providing that interest should not be awarded where there were disputed issues. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest. However, the term &quot;costs&quot; was strictly interpreted to include only filing fees and statutory witness fees and the trial court erred in including in the costs award expenses for deposition transcription, medical records acquisition, photograph and diagram exhibits, and photocopying.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The award of prejudgment interest was affirmed. The costs award was reversed and the case was remanded for a cost determination consistent with the opinion. It was ordered that the cost determination would also include the costs for appeal, with 70 percent to be taxed to the negligent motorist and 30 percent to be taxed to the injured person and his wife.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim had passed out while drinking, and while she was unconscious, defendant had sex with her. Defendant argued that he was entitled to dismissal since the statute with which he was charged, Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-1(a)(2) was unconstitutionally vague in that the term &quot;unaware&quot; was undefined. The appellate court held that the definition of the term &quot;unaware&quot; was not aware, lacking knowledge or acquaintance, unconscious.  Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-1(a)(2) required that the victim be &quot;unaware&quot; that the sex was occurring. Generally, if a man had intercourse with a woman while she was asleep, he was guilty of rape since the act was without her consent. The language of the statute was adequate to inform an individual of ordinary intelligence that sexual intercourse with an individual who had lost consciousness due to inebriation was proscribed. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The State provided logical non-discriminatory reasons for peremptory juror strikes, as its responses, as a whole, did not disclose inherent discriminatory intent. Defendant demonstrated no reversible error in regard to the State's peremptory strikes of three black women.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant presented four issues: (1) whether Ind.

Section 35-46-1-5 unambiguously informed defendant that criminal penalties could have attached to his failure to support his children and was not unconstitutionally vague. While defendant was able to offer evidence of his incarceration as an affirmative defense, his incarceration was not an absolute bar to his conviction for nonsupport of a dependant child as a Class C felony. Because defendant had the burden of proving his affirmative defense of inability to pay, it was his prerogative to assess whether the probative value of his criminal history was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial nature. Defendant was not &quot;forced&quot; to reveal his criminal background. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When police responded to reports of gunshots, they found a handgun in the area on which the serial number had been obliterated. An officer testified that the area where the serial number had been was &quot;very shiny.&quot; Other witnesses testified that they had seen defendant with the gun on the night of the arrest and at his birthday party a week earlier. The appellate court held that for a conviction of possession of an altered handgun, the State was required to prove that defendant knew that the serial number had been altered. Knowledge could be proved by circumstantial evidence. The appellate court held that based on the officer's testimony and the fact that defendant possessed the gun for over a week and had ample opportunity to discover that the serial number had been removed, the State provided adequate evidence to support the conviction. However, the appellate court held that the State failed to establish a nexus between defendant's gang membership and the charged crimes. Thus, the State failed to present probative evidence from which a reasonable jury could have found defendant guilty of criminal gang activity beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-5-1 violated equal protection as there was no threshold level of impairment needed for those with controlled substances in their blood as was required of those with alcohol in their blood. The appellate court found that it was impossible to determine the amount of marijuana or cocaine in the body and there was no agreement as to the quantity of a controlled substance needed to cause impairment. Thus, it was reasonable to distinguish between alcohol and controlled substances and to ban driving with any level of controlled substance in the body. Defendant also argued that the statute violated substantive due process, but banning those with any level of controlled substances in their body from driving was not without a rational basis. The disparate treatment reasonably distinguished between those with alcohol from those with controlled substances in their blood, so the statute did not confer an improper privilege. As the State was required to prove that defendant operated a vehicle with the drugs in his body, it was his driving, and not his status as a drug user, that was being punished.  Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-5-1 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

After receiving the deceased's diagnosis of metastatic endometrial cancer in March, 1995, the representative had 10 months of the occurrence-based two-year statute of limitations remaining during which he should have filed his complaint.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient and his wife filed suit against defendant doctor, alleging he misdiagnosed a vitamin B-12 deficiency as multiple sclerosis. The doctor filed for summary judgment, alleging the claims were barred by the two-year statute of limitations, Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1(b) (1998). The Vanderburgh Circuit Court (Indiana) denied the motion, finding a genuine issue of material fact existed, and certified its order for interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was diagnosed with a vitamin B-12 deficiency about seven years after the original, erroneous diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Defendant physician had relocated out of the area about two years after the erroneous diagnosis. The complaint was filed one week less than two years after the date of the second diagnosis. In upholding the trial court's denial of the doctor's motion for summary judgment, the appellate court found that the occurrence-based statute of limitations, Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1(b) (1998), was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs who could not have discovered the injury with reasonable diligence within two years of the alleged misconduct. Since the facts of the instant case were undisputed, and there was no evidence or inference that the patient reasonably could have or should have discovered the misdiagnosis, the limitation period did not begin to run until he obtained the information regarding the vitamin deficiency. Since the complaint was filed within two years thereafter, the denial of the doctor's motion for summary judgment was proper. Additionally, with undisputed facts, the patient was entitled to summary judgment on the issue.</SPAN></P>

The complaint was filed within two years of the husband's diagnosis and his death, but more than 10 years after his last alleged exposure to asbestos. The manufacturers' and distributors' motions for summary judgment were denied. The appellate court held that &sect; 34-20-3-2 applied to persons who mined and sold commercial asbestos. The executrix had a valid tort claim that was not discoverable until after 10 years had passed. The manufacturers and distributors failed to first raise the issue of whether they sold commercial asbestos to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the State provided the trial court with sufficient evidence to prove that defendant's convictions in another state were felonies. Defendant was properly adjudged a habitual offender. The instruction on voluntary intoxication did not misstate the law. The evidence was sufficient to support the murder conviction. The State successfully rebutted defendant's showing that he killed the victim while in a state of sudden heat. The error in allowing a detective to testify as to whether he believed various assertions made by defendant was not prejudicial. The trial court properly considered defendant killing the victim with his bare hands as part of the nature and circumstances of the crime committed.

The unidentified man walked away when he saw the police approaching. Before the officers could initiate a traffic stop, defendant drove away. By then, defendant's car had been parked in the street for at least 15 seconds. The officers followed defendant for several blocks and then executed a traffic stop. As one officer approached defendant's car, he smelled marijuana. During a pat down search, defendant fled on foot. After arresting defendant, the officers searched defendant's car and found a bag of marijuana. The appellate court held that police could stop a vehicle when an officer observed a minor traffic violation. For purposes of the validity of a vehicle stop following a traffic infraction, it was of no significance that the stop was executed several blocks from the scene of the infraction. The officer's suspicion of illegal activity that was aroused by the odor of marijuana provided a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle contained narcotics, thus permitting a search of the vehicle after the traffic stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the hearings, evidence was presented that a court had terminated the parents' relationship with three other children in earlier proceedings.  Ind. Code &sect; 31-34-21-5.6 provided that reasonable efforts to reunify a child with the parents were not required if the rights of the parents with respect to a child had been involuntarily terminated by a court in another case. The parents argued that this infringed on their fundamental right to family integrity and violated due process. The appellate court held that there was a fundamental right to family integrity, and as Ind. Code &sect; 31-34-21-5.6 burdened the exercise of that right, it received the strictest scrutiny. The fundamental right to family integrity was not unlimited as the state had a compelling interest in protecting the welfare of children. With some parents the risk of recidivism was a real concern, and when another child of that same parent was adjudged dependent, it was not unreasonable to assume that reunification efforts would be unsuccessful.  Ind. Code &sect; 31-34-21-5.6 served a compelling state interest and was narrowly tailored to serve that interest; thus it did not violate substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

The owner of the pawnshop was shot by one of the other men during the robbery. After his mother arrived at the police station, and she and the defendant signed a Miranda advisement and waiver form, defendant confessed. Defendant argued on appeal that admission of his confession by the trial court was error. The appellate court reviewed the circumstances of the statement and found that the trial court did not err in finding that defendant's statement was given voluntarily. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-11, a sentencing enhancement statute based on use of a firearm during the robbery. The application of the statute did not offend due process under the Jones and Apprendi standard. The charging information alleged that defendant committed the robbery while armed with a handgun, and all of the bases for the felony conviction arose out of the use of the gun during the robbery, so the jury must have found that a gun was used. The fact that defendant himself was not the actual shooter was irrelevant, because defendant's actions had aided in the commission of the robbery.</SPAN></P>

Following the biological mother's death, the adoptive father initiated paternity proceedings to establish paternity of the child.

The grandparents requested post-adoption grandparent visitation. The trial court found that the grandparents lacked standing to seek post-adoption visitation rights. On appeal, the grandparents argued the trial court erred in finding the grandparents lacked standing to pursue a claim under the Indiana Grandparent Visitation Statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 31-17-5-1 et seq. Specifically, the grandparents contended that the purpose and intent of the Grandparent Visitation Statute would be thwarted if they were denied a continuing relationship with the child. The appellate court concluded that inasmuch as the adoptive father was not a step-parent or a biological relative specified in Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of child molesting by a jury in the Harrison Superior Court (Indiana) and was sentenced. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the information was vague and failed to inform him adequately of the charges against him. The charging information did not specify the exact dates of the alleged crimes, but it narrowed the range of dates to five months. The appellate court held that because time was not the essence of the offense of child molesting, it was sufficient to allege time specifically enough to show that the offense was committed within the period of limitations. The crimes were adequately charged to allow defendant to prepare a defense. Because the information was sufficient, defendant was not prejudiced by his counsel's failure to bring a motion to dismiss and his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was unfounded. Evidence of other incidents of sexual conduct between defendant and the child victim and an incident involving both the victim and her sister was properly admitted as direct evidence that defendant committed the crimes and thus was not evidence offered to show defendant's bad character. Depositions of absent witnesses were properly admitted where defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine. Finally, the sentence was proper under the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A detective executed a search warrant after the probable cause supporting the warrant had allegedly dissipated. In its earlier opinion affirming the trial court' denial of the motion to dismiss, the appellate court relied on the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. After the search in question, the appellate court had held that the execution of a warrant within the 10 day period for execution of warrants under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-33-5-7 could be unconstitutional if the probable cause supporting the warrant had dissipated before the search. Prior to that decision, however, the police officer could rely on the statute when executing the search unless the statute was &quot;clearly unconstitutional.&quot; The good faith exception should have applied when an officer relied in good faith on the constitutionality of a statute that was later determined to be unconstitutional, because an officer could not be expected to question the judgment of the legislature that passed the law. Police officers were not expected to understand the intricacies of the constitution like attorneys should have. The good faith exception applied in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was exposed to asbestos over a 27 year period of his employment which ultimately led to his death. Decedent's widow filed suit against an insulation company and multiple other defendants. All defendants filed for summary judgment which the trial court granted.

However, the remaining refractory companies and insulation companies, which filed for summary judgment on the basis that the widow's claims were filed outside of the 10-year products liability statute of repose codified at Ind. Code &sect; 34-20-3-1, and that the widow failed to present sufficient evidence that the decedent was exposed to their asbestos-containing products. The trial court granted those motions, and the widow appealed. The appellate court found that the statutory construction urged by the defendants was inconsistent with other provisions of the product liability act. The appellate court found, therefore, that summary judgment on the ground that none of the companies mined commercial asbestos was improper.

The city argued that &sect; 36-4-3-13(e) was not a general law as required by Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 23. The challenged statute was applicable to any county that, because of increased or decreased population growth, fell within the prescribed limits. The statute prescribed neither a restrictive population range nor mandatory cut-off time for qualification. Thus, it was not predestined to apply to only one county. It was susceptible of uniform application to any county in the State meeting the population criteria. It was general rather than special legislation. The city failed to prove that Ind.

Trial P. 60(B)(7), from a judgment by the Jennings Circuit Court (Indiana) which granted grandparent visitation to appellee grandmother, pursuant to Indiana's Grandparent Visitation Act.  Ind. Code &sect; 31-17-5-1. Following denial of her motion for relief from the judgment, the mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother, in presenting a motion for relief from a judgment which granted the grandmother visitation, cited a case which was decided after the entry of the judgment. She argued the original order was no longer equitable and the trial court had improperly failed to apply the presumption that the mother's decision to limit or deny visitation was in her child's best interests. The appellate court stated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protected the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. It also held there was a presumption that fit parents acted in the best interests of their children. Applying a rational basis test, the constitutionality of the Indiana Grandparent Visitation Act was upheld. A new hearing on the grandparent visitation request was ordered to properly develop the record and present evidence, with the burden upon the grandmother to rebut the presumption that the mother was acting in the best interests of her child in attempting to limit or deny visitation.</SPAN></P>

The Dubois Circuit Court (Indiana) granted summary judgment in favor of the doctors, finding that the action was not commenced with the two-year statute of limitations provided by Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1(b). The husband appealed the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife died due to a rupture of her ascending aorta. The husband asserted that the doctors in question were negligent because the care they rendered fell below the accepted standard of care and resulted in the misdiagnosis of the wife's condition, and that this misdiagnosis significantly contributed to the wife's failure to obtain appropriate medical care. The appellate court held that the trial court properly determined that the husband's actions against all except one doctor were barred by the statute of limitations. The appellate court found that Ind. Code &sect; 34-18-7-1(b) was not unconstitutional in the instant case, because the statute of limitations did not shorten the window of time so unreasonably that it was impractical for the husband to file the claims. However, the appellate court held that the husband presented genuine issues of fact as to whether the doctrine of fraudulent concealment tolled the statute of limitations as to one doctor. The husband presented facts indicating that the wife's patient-physician relationship with the doctor continued until the wife's death, and the statute of limitations ran from the time the patient-physician relationship ended.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in admitting over objection the testimony of a police officer regarding an incident wherein she left two of her children unattended in an automobile. The erroneous admission of that evidence did not require reversal when evidence of the same probative value was admitted without objection. The trial court's order that defendant not become pregnant while on probation served no rehabilitative purpose and could adequately be served by alternative restrictions less subversive of defendant's fundamental right to procreate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that revoking her bond was an abuse of discretion absent reasonable suspicion of drug use to justify ordering the drug test, and that the trial judge showed bias in ordering the drug test. The State, in what the appellate court construed as cross-appeal issues, argued that defendant waived consideration of her appeal because the bond revocation order was interlocutory and defendant did not comply with the procedure for an interlocutory appeal, and that defendant waived consideration of her bond revocation claim by failing to provide a transcript of a bond reduction hearing. Because the revocation of defendant's bond was severable from the adjudication of the charge against her and because the trial court declared the bond revocation to be a final appealable order, the appellate court chose to address the appeal and further held that the missing transcript was not necessary to the issues on appeal. The appellate court found no abuse of discretion and held that defendant's failure to object when the trial court imposed random drug testing as a bond condition waived later objections to such testing and that defendant failed to prove actual bias.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a real estate preservation commission and people who owned homes in the preservation area, sued defendant's, husband and wife. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) enjoined defendants from taking any action to improve, alter, petition for a certificate of appropriateness, or attempt to advance completion of work on their home pending further order of the court, and defendants' filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Husband and wife obtained permission from the Meridian Street Preservation Commission (the commission) to make changes to their home. They revised their plans without additional permission, however, and used the original approval to obtain a building permit. That permit was later revoked, and husband and wife filed a lawsuit challenging the decision to revoke the permit, but lost. In this action by the commission to obtain an injunction preventing husband and wife from making unapproved changes to their property, the appellate court held that (1) because husband and wife failed to provide a legal analysis of their claim that a preliminary injunction violated their rights under the state constitution, those claims were waived; (2) to the extent the preliminary injunction prohibited husband and wife from petitioning the commission to approve plans significantly different from plans already rejected, it was overbroad; and (3) to the extent husband and wife had not followed proper appellate procedures and the commission and other appellees incurred attorneys' fees to defend those improper actions, appellees were entitled to recover their attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court remanded the case to the trial court for further action to revise the preliminary injunction and to determine appropriate attorney fees. The court also granted the commission's motion to strike facts which husband and wife improperly included in their appellate brief, but it denied the commission's motion to investigate the authenticity of wife's signature on husband and wife's appellate brief.</SPAN></P>

The informant's reliability was not an issue because the warrant was not based upon the informant's statements, but on the officer's own observations. There was sufficient information about the surveillance and the search and observation of the informant during the controlled buy. Execution was within the statutory time period. The officer executed the warrant in good faith even though there were no other controlled buys. Subsequent sales were reported. Surveillance continued and other controlled buys were attempted. Finally, defendant offered to sell cocaine to informant three days prior to execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions, in Marion Superior Court, of aggravated battery and weapon possession by a serious violent offender, arguing that prosecutorial misconduct denied him a fair trial and that Ind. Code &sect; 35-47-4-5 violated his constitutional guarantees of the right to bear arms and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued he was denied a fair trial when a prosecutor stated in closing argument that he could not argue self-defense in response to charges of murder and aggravated battery. The reviewing court held, first, that defendant waived the issue because he failed to move for admonishment or mistrial at the time. Furthermore, there was no error, because the trial court accurately instructed the jury on the law of self-defense.  Ind. Code &sect; 35-47-4-5, which prohibited serious violent felons from knowingly or intentionally possessing weapons, did not violate Indiana's privileges or immunities clause, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, or a public policy favoring reformation of felons, or the right to bear arms guarantee of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 32, or the equal protection guarantee of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Defendant was not a member of a protected class, and the law had a rational relationship to preventing violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed. Although defendant waived misconduct issue, there was no error anyway, because jurors were properly instructed. The challenged statute had a rational basis, in protecting the community against those with a strong likelihood of engaging in violence again.</SPAN></P>

The same conduct led to the battery and invasion of privacy charges that she sought to dismiss. Her bond was later reinstated. The appellate court held (1) defendant's improper inclusion in the appellate record of certain materials that were not before the trial court was harmless and (2) based on (a) the historical view of bail revocation, (b) the fact the aim of the bail revocation statute was not crime prevention or punishment but a determination of when defendants should be free pending trial, and (c) an examination of the text of the bail revocation statute, including its lack of a scienter requirement, the temporary revocation of defendant's bail was not a criminal punishment and did not amount to jeopardy such that her motion to dismiss was correctly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon, in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-47-4-5, after a jury trial in the Noble Circuit Court (Indiana). In a separate proceeding, the court found that defendant was an habitual offender. The court sentenced defendant to 20 years in prison on the primary offense and an additional 30 years as an habitual offender. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Armed with a warrant, police searched a home and found 18 firearms in a basement room where defendant and his girlfriend lived. Although the girlfriend claimed that the weapons were hers, a jury convicted defendant of possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon. The appellate court held that (1) because the jury could have inferred constructive possession from defendant's use of the room where firearms were found, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for possession of a firearm; (2) Ind. Code &sect; 35-47-4-5 was constitutional; (3) defendant was not denied his right to effective assistance of counsel, or his right to counsel of his choice; (4) the trial judge acted properly in replacing a juror who informed the judge during trial that he knew the victim of a crime defendant committed in 1978, rather than declaring a mistrial; but (5) the Indiana Supreme Court's Ross opinion, which was issued after defendant was convicted but before his case was heard on appeal, invalidated the trial court's action of enhancing defendant's sentence through the general habitual offender statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction, but reversed his sentence to the extent the trial court enhanced the sentence through the general offender statute, and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to vacate the habitual sentence enhancement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff purchased approximately land in Warrick County on which he planned to construct eight buildings containing 457 mini-storage units. To that end, plaintiff had the property rezoned, and he secured conditional use and commercial driveway permits. When plaintiff hired an engineering firm to complete the building permit process, he learned that a &quot;regulated drain&quot; abuts the western border of his property and that his construction project encroached upon the right-of-way associated with the drain. Plaintiff asked defendant board to reduce the right-of-way to twenty-five feet, but defendant would only decrease the encumbrance to fifty feet. Plaintiff filed suit alleging that the regulated drain constituted a taking of his property. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant, and plaintiff appealed. The appellate court found that the evidence indicated that plaintiff took his property subject to the statutory seventy-five foot right-of-way, and that no unconstitutional taking occurred when defendant enforced its rights on the easement. Given that there was no genuine issue of material fact, defendant board was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a fatal automobile accident, which was caused by the other driver, the Pulaski Superior Court (Indiana) convicted appellant of a class C misdemeanor for operating a vehicle while having marijuana in his body, a Schedule I controlled substance. Appellant filed an appeal challenging his conviction on the constitutional grounds of unreasonable search or seizure, equal protection and vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the chemical testing of appellant's blood was a reasonable search, and that Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-7 was constitutionally applied. Section 9-30-7-3 permitted the officer to have appellant's blood tested based solely on the ground that appellant had been in a fatal automobile accident, even though the other driver was at fault. Further, the statute did not remove the requirement for probable cause, it merely established appellant's consent, as a vehicle operator, following a fatal collision. Additionally, appellant's federal equal protection claim failed because the state had a legitimate purpose in providing for safe roadways and &sect; 9-30-7 was rationally related to achieving that purpose. Appellant waived his state equal protection challenge as he failed to provide a separate analysis. Finally, Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-5-1(b) was not unconstitutionally vague as it applied to the metabolites of marijuana. That section, read with Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-2-4(b)(14), adequately and unambiguously informed persons of ordinary intelligence of the proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The search was reasonable as the officer could draw blood based solely on the occurrence of the fatal automobile accident. There was no requirement that probable cause of intoxication be shown before appellant could be asked to submit to a chemical test. Further, appellant's federal equal protection challenge failed as the state had a legitimate purpose.</SPAN></P>

The property was then sold at a tax sale. The appellate court found that the adequacy of a county's notice of a tax sale was an important question that was likely to recur and the record of the tax sale of appellant's property could subject them to a negative collateral consequence that would be unjustified if the sale was invalid due to inadequate notice. The auditor's failure to re-mail the notice of the tax sale to appellant's new address deprived them of notice reasonably calculated under all the circumstances to apprise them of the pendency of the tax sale and failed to afford appellant's the opportunity to present their objections. The court held that as a result of the constitutionally inadequate notice, the tax sale was invalid and appellant's petition to set aside tax sale should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

The Hancock Superior Court (Indiana) found for plaintiff and awarded damages. Defendants appealed claiming immunity from liability under the Indiana Tort Claims Act (ITCA), Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 34-13-3-1 to -25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a juvenile escaped from a detention center, dogs were brought in to search for him. During the search, plaintiff was bitten by one of the dogs. The court held that because plaintiff's damages resulted from defendant police dog handler's deployment of the dog, which constituted the enforcement of law in the scope of his employment, defendants were immune from liability pursuant to the ITCA. Indiana governmental units were afforded extensive protections from tort liability under the ITCA. The only exceptions to immunity specifically recognized in the ITCA were false arrest and false imprisonment.  Ind. Code &sect; 34-13-3-3(7). Defendant officer was defendant city's employee at the time of the incident, plaintiff did not allege false arrest or false imprisonment, and plaintiff did not contend that defendant officer was acting outside the scope of his employment when he deployed the dog. The use of the dog amounted to the enforcement of the law within the meaning of the ITCA. A prior federal court action had already determined that the actions did not amount to excessive force.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. Defendants had statutory immunity from liability for plaintiff's injuries because the deployment of the dog was a law enforcement activity within the scope of defendant dog handler's employment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed Pulaski Circuit Court (Indiana) order revoking his in-home detention and revocation and ordering his incarceration, arguing that the trial court should have suppressed drug test results, that probation should not have been revoked before it began, and that sentencing order was impermissibly unclear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's plea agreement resulted in a sentence with work release, at-home detention, and probation elements. Detention and probation were revoked when defendant flunked drug tests authorized by terms of his at-home detention. The court looked to the extent of a detainee's privacy interest, the extent of actual intrusion, and the governmental interest at stake, and found that the urine tests were reasonable and their results admissible. Defendant's probationary period started at sentencing, even though actual probation was revoked before it began, so the trial court had the power to revoke it prospectively for violation within the probationary period. Finally, although the sentencing order confusingly failed to indicate whether in-home detention was a direct community corrections placement or a condition of probation, when read together with the plea agreement, which was construed as any other contract, the parties clearly intended that defendant should be subject to incarceration for violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order. The drug test was a reasonable intrusion under the circumstances. Prospective revocation of probation was proper because defendant's probationary period had already begun.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant was charged with five counts of receiving stolen property and six counts of receiving stolen auto parts. Eight of the 11 counts were dismissed. Police went to appellant's residence after receiving information he might know about stolen property. Officers saw a white semi-tractor, which resembled one that had been stolen, sitting in or near the driveway. Although the semi-tractor appeared to be the one that had been stolen, the officers looked for a partial vehicle identification number (VIN) in the wheel-well. An officer using a flashlight had to wipe dirt off the VIN plate to observe its numbers. Officers also walked into outbuildings where they observed a trenching machine. Further, while at appellant's back door, they saw a gold GMC Jimmy vehicle which had its VIN concealed. Appellant's motion to suppress each item was denied. He appealed. The court partly affirmed and partly reversed. Wiping the dirt off the semi-tractor's VIN plate and walking into the building to view the trenching machine violated appellant's reasonable expectation of privacy, but viewing the gold GMC Jimmy from the back door while it was parked in the carport did not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed convictions in Marion Superior Court (Indiana) of unlawful firearm possession by a serious violent felon and carrying a handgun without a license, arguing entitlement to bifurcated trial, that punishment was disproportionate, violations of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 14, 23, and improper reliance on aggravating factors in sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of carrying a firearm without a license and, because of an old robbery conviction, handgun possession by a serious violent felon. The court held that defendant waived appeal of failure to bifurcate by not objecting before trial. The Indiana legislature was free to determine which offenses warranted which sentences. Equal protection was not violated by the legislative determination, not mathematically precise, that some crimes were violent serious felonies for purposes of the firearms law and some were not. However, the fact that the same evidence was probably used to convict defendant of both offenses violated double jeopardy protection and required vacation of one conviction. Finally, the trial court erred in applying defendant's need for corrective activity relating to alcoholism and danger of minimizing his offense's seriousness as aggravating factors, so remand was required to determine whether the single aggravating factor of criminal history warranted his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the serious violent felon conviction, but vacated the other conviction for double jeopardy violation. Because the trial court improperly applied the need for corrective activity and depreciating the seriousness of the offense aggravators, the court remanded for determination whether the single remaining aggravator justified the sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of and sentence for battery of a law enforcement officer, a class D felony, and operating a vehicle while intoxicated, a class A misdemeanor, by the Crawford Circuit Court (Indiana).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer was dispatched to defendant's residence after defendant was reported to have a gun, and to have threatened to kill persons. The dispatched officer observed defendant driving on the wrong side of the road and other evidence of intoxication. The defendant grabbed the officer by the testicles, and would not let go until the officer struck and choked defendant. After testing defendant's alcohol level at the sheriff's department, defendant struck the officer again at the hospital where defendant was taken for treatment. Defendant's conviction and sentence for battery of a law enforcement officer and operating a vehicle while intoxicated was affirmed after his appeal. The prosecution had agreed, in response to the defendant's in limine motion, for the officer not to testify about the reasons for dispatch to investigate defendant. Admission of the officer's testimony about those matters, and admission of his notes, was error, but not reversible error. There was other cumulative testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence were affirmed. Admission of the officer's testimony, in violation of an in limine order, and his handwritten notes was not reversible error since there was cumulative evidence. Lack of remorse was not an aggravating factor here, since there was no evidence of defendant's bad faith, but the court was persuaded the original sentencing decision would have remained the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant confessed to murder which the only trial witness testified he committed. Appellant was convicted and given 60 years. That was affirmed. Post-conviction relief was denied. Appeal of the denial was dismissed because of counsel's mistake. Summary disposition without a hearing was granted the state in appellant's second post-conviction relief petition. The court affirmed. The trial court's error in not holding a hearing was not prejudicial in that there was no genuine issue of material fact and the state was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Counsel's mistake was not prejudicial because the court would have affirmed denial of appellant's first post-conviction petition. Appellant's claims of error were waived, barred by res judicata, or failed on the merits. Although his co-defendant was acquitted, Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-2-3 allowed appellant's conviction as principal whether he was characterized as that or as accessory. Trial court appointment of dermatologist expert for appellant would have been wasteful.  Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-6-3.3, on sentence reduction for education in prison earned after appellant had earned his, did not violate his equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the Boone (Indiana) Superior Court's denial of his petition for post-conviction relief, following his convictions for murder and kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder and kidnapping. He filed a petition for post-conviction relief, contending that the conviction for both crimes constituted double jeopardy, and that collateral estoppel required that his conviction of kidnapping be vacated. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that &quot;occurring in the course of a kidnapping&quot; was not one of the elements of murder under Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-4-1. That the murder occurred in the course of a kidnapping only served to elevate the penalty for the crime of murder to death rather than life imprisonment. When appellant's sentence was commuted from death to life imprisonment, the kidnapping became irrelevant to the murder conviction. Under the Blockburger same elements test, murder in the first degree and kidnapping each required proof of at least one element which the other did not, and thus the two convictions survived double jeopardy scrutiny. Second, nonmutual collateral estoppel was not applicable to a criminal case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court judgment affirmed. The State charged and proved that appellant committed intentional murder, and the allegation that the murder occurred in the course of a kidnapping served only to enhance the sentence. Therefore, the convictions for both offenses did not violate double jeopardy. Second, collateral estoppel did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendant for intentional interference with business. Defendant counterclaimed alleging defamation, invasion of privacy, abuse of process and frivolous litigation. During the appellate process for plaintiffs' claim, defendant's complaint proceeded to trial whereby a jury returned a verdict in favor of defendant for $ 178,240 in compensatory damages and $ 1.54 million in punitives from which plaintiffs appealed. Plaintiffs alleged seven points of error on appeal. The appellate court found that the trial court did not err in refusing to allow plaintiffs to amend their pleadings to match the evidence because there was nothing in the record to validate plaintiffs' amended affirmative defense. Further, the appellate court found that the trial court did not err in submitting certain issues to the jury because the issues were questions of fact and not of law. Finally, the appellate court found that the trial court was not obligated to provide the jury with written copies of the jury instructions and by re-reading the instructions to the jury, it did not abuse its discretion. As such, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed because the trial court properly denied plaintiff's request to amend its pleadings to conform to the evidence inasmuch as the record did not reflect any evidence which would mandate an amended pleading.

Also, pursuant to Ind.

The conviction was not an ex post facto violation where the statute punished appellant for the crime committed in 1999, when he was found to be in possession of the weapon, not for his 1996 felony conviction. There was no substantive due process violation because appellant failed to show a deprivation in his case that was without a rational basis. The warrantless search of the house was not a constitutional violation. There were five adults in the house where appellant was arrested. Officers heard a barking dog, which was a pit bull. Officer safety justified a protective sweep of the house. Sentence of six to 20 years was not unconstitutionally disproportionate where the presumptive sentence was 10 years with the possible addition of 10 years for aggravating factors and appellant's criminal history was an aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant class representatives had an autistic child with behavioral problems who was removed from their home. Appellants continued to maintain a close relationship with child. Office of family and children (OFC) created a permanency plan, recommending long term foster or institutional care with regular visitation. Subsequently, Ind. Code &sect; 31-35-2-4.5 (1998) was enacted, which required filing of termination petition in appellants' situation. Thus, OFC initiated termination proceedings. Appellants filed a class action complaint. Trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss. The court affirmed. The statute did not conflict with 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 675(5)(E) (Supp. III 1997). The only difference between the two was a trial court's involvement in determining child's best interests. Although statute did curtail executive branch discretion, it did not violate separation of powers provision. The legislative branch was exercising its power to enact laws, merely setting a time period to file a termination petition.</SPAN></P>

R. Trial P. 60(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant police officer pled guilty to misdemeanor domestic violence. His guilty plea cost him his job under a federal statute making it illegal for persons convicted of misdemeanors to possess firearms.

R. Trial P. 60(b), available in cases of mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect. Defendant was not entitled to relief under any theory. The new statute was not newly discovered evidence; it made defendant no less guilty of the underlying offense. His plea was not invalid, because collateral consequences had nothing to do with its integrity. Finally, relief from judgment was only available to defendants who raised a meritorious defense, and defendant had none.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, because collateral effects of defendant's guilty plea did not affect validity of judgment based on his having committed the offense in question.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant railroad's predecessor used strips of land acquired from plaintiffs' predecessors for use as railroad rights-of-way. Plaintiffs brought a class action seeking a declaratory judgment that defendant's predecessors acquired only easements that were extinguished upon abandonment, but defendant argued that the deeds conveyed fee interests. The court looked to each of 21 deeds, finding some to convey fee interests and some to convey easements. In determining whether deeds were ambiguous enough to construe them against the original railroad drafters, the court looked primarily to the granting clauses to see whether they contained limiting language. Failure of plaintiffs to provide proof that they had quieted title in themselves did not deprive defendant of due process, because at this stage plaintiffs only sought declaratory relief eliminating defendant as a claimant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Looking to granting clauses to determine existence of ambiguities, the court affirmed for all deeds that trial court found had conveyed fee estates, and reversed only one determination that a deed conveyed an easement. There was no due process violation because plaintiffs merely requested declaratory relief, not quieting of title.</SPAN></P>

IV, and whether defendant's disorderly conduct conviction violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of resisting law enforcement, a class A misdemeanor, and disorderly conduct, a class B misdemeanor. Defendant appealed his convictions, contending that the arresting officer used excessive force against him in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV, and that his disorderly conduct conviction violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court held, first, that the consideration of the Graham factors, the severity of the crime, whether defendant posed an immediate threat to the safety of the arresting officer or others, and whether defendant was actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight, compelled the conclusion that the force the officer used against defendant was objectively unreasonable and unconstitutionally excessive. Second, the speech defendant engaged in prior to his arrest, and which plaintiff relied upon to support his disorderly conduct conviction, was protected political expression. Defendant's speech was directed to the legality and appropriateness of police conduct toward a third party and constituted criticism of an official acting under color of law. Consequently, defendant's convictions were reversed.</SPAN></P>

South Bend had in place a contract between the city and the police department providing for mandatory drug and alcohol testing when there was reasonable cause to believe that an employee operating a city-owned vehicle caused an accident causing $ 1,500 or more in property damages or causing injury to the employee or other individual to determine if drugs, alcohol, or other metabolites were in the employee's system. Defendant was given two breath tests. The first resulted in a blood alcohol content of .101, and the second resulted in a blood alcohol content of .106. Defendant was charged with, inter alia, operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated resulting in serious bodily injury to another person, but trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the test results.

Defendant contended that the prosecution improperly induced defendant to move for a mistrial, and that defendant's convictions for battery causing serious bodily injury and battery with a deadly weapon violated double jeopardy principles. The court found that defendant's retrial did not violate federal double jeopardy because the prosecutor had not intended to force defendant to seek a mistrial. However, the convictions were for the same offense, violating double jeopardy under Ind.

Petitioner challenged the visitation order as unsupported by the findings of fact and conclusions based on them, and the court agreed. Despite the deference usually shown to the trial court's findings, especially in family law cases, the court found that the trial court failed to make two findings that were absolutely required before making a grant of visitation to a non-parent, non-grandparent third party: existence of a custodial and parental relationship and that visitation would be in the child's best interest. Since these findings were not made, there was no basis for ordering visitation. Petitioner also challenged the order as contrary to Indiana law and violative of family privacy rights, but the court did not reach these issues.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant challenged whether: (1) the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for summary judgment on the issue of the statute of limitations; (2) the trial court properly considered plaintiff's designated evidence in ruling on defendant's motion; and (3) the trial court improperly relied on the doctrine of collateral estoppel in ruling on defendant's motion. The court affirmed the judgment, holding the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court reasoned that plaintiff did not have reason to know, nor should he have known, that his mother's death was attributable to negligence until after the two-year limitations period had expired, therefore, plaintiff's claim was properly filed. Further, the court concluded that plaintiff's designation of evidence was proper, and the trial court could deny the motion for summary judgment on any theory the evidence supported, and did not improperly rely on collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>

Appellants were not entitled to the constitutional protections of a criminal proceeding under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 and U.S. Const. amend. VI because the penalty provision of Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-9-7(d) was civil. The sanction was civil because the legislature labeled it a civil penalty and the only remedy was monetary.

VI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged denial of his post-conviction petition that sought relief from his conviction for felony murder. Petitioner presented two issues for the court's review: 1) whether a delay of nearly six and one-half years constituted a denial of petitioner's right to a speedy trial; 2) whether petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court balanced four Barker factors; the delay in the case was inordinately long and the court was assuming that the speedy trial issue was timely raised. The reason for most of the delay was attributable to petitioner's incompetency, not inaction by the State, though one year and four months of the delay was fairly attributable to the State's negligence. Given the State's tardiness, petitioner's burden of establishing grounds for relief on his speedy trial claim was less. Petitioner failed to provide the court with indicators of prejudice. As to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, petitioner was not prejudiced by defense counsel's failure to file a motion to dismiss on the ground of unconstitutional delay, nor did defense counsel's decision fall below an objectively reasonable level. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Petitioner failed to show that he was prejudiced by delay in trial, although part of the delay was caused by the State's negligence.

Additionally, the trial court properly issued the protective order once it had decided that petitioner was truthful about respondent's actions, and that the conduct was sufficient to constitute abuse, harassment, or disturbing of the peace. Moreover the protective order was not vague and addressed the specific situation. Finally, the order was no more restrictive than that necessary to accomplish the goal of a broad prohibition on all forms of communication at the workplace between the parties, and although the order limited respondent's U.S. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sued defendant optometrist. Plaintiff had been treated by defendant for several years.

That doctor referred plaintiff to a glaucoma specialist who informed plaintiff in December of 1995 that plaintiff had glaucoma and had it for several years. Plaintiff waited until December of 1997 to sue. Defendant moved for summary judgment and alleged the two-year statute of limitation period ran out in October of 1997, two years after he last could have missed diagnosing the glaucoma. The trial court granted the motion. Plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed. The court held the medical malpractice statute of limitations was constitutional as applied to patients, such as plaintiff, who discovered the medical malpractice well before the limitations period expired, but after the medical malpractice had occurred.</SPAN></P>

Appellant landowners, in alleging damage to their aesthetic interests, were in essence claiming damage to their property. This was the only legally protectable injury identified in their complaint. Nevertheless, the harm appellants alleged was too remote. The trial court did not err in determining that appellant landowners lacked standing. The trial court also did not err in determining that appellant organization lacked standing. Appellants also alleged that the enactment of the riverboat gambling law violated the single subject requirement of the Indiana Constitution. Nevertheless, they claimed no particular harm from this violation. Appellants' injury from this alleged violation was the same general injury suffered by the public as a whole.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured while working at a construction site. He contacted defendant with respect to scheduling medical care and temporary total disability benefits. Defendant did not respond.

His allegations amounted to independent torts which did not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Indiana Worker's Compensation Board. The portion of Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-4-12.1 which gave the board exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether the employer's worker's compensation insurance carrier committed an independent tort in adjusting or settling the claim was unconstitutional as violative of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, which guaranteed that courts were open, and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, which guaranteed the right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Indiana law permitted counties to contribute up to $ 5,000 to their judges' salaries. After the legislature enacted large judicial salary increases, defendant elected to discontinue supplemental payments. Plaintiff judge sought writ of mandamus and other relief, arguing that this constituted a salary reduction in violation of Ind. Const. art. VII, &sect; 19. Applying traditional principles of statutory construction, the court determined both from plain language and legislative history that the statutory scheme envisioned a single system of judicial salaries, not two separate systems. When the two sources of income were combined for each year, plaintiff's actual salary was never decreased, so defendant's action was not unconstitutional. Since plaintiff had now lost on the merits, his cross-appeal of the trial court's denial of liquidated damages and attorney fees was also unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part, and remanded with instructions to enter summary judgment for defendant, because it construed statutes to mean state and local payments constituted a single salary; thus, plaintiff's pay was never unconstitutionally reduced. The court affirmed damages and fees denial, since plaintiff did not prevail on merits.</SPAN></P>

The sentences on the convictions for counts one through four were to run concurrently, with 40 years of the sentence on count five consecutive to the other sentences, and the remaining 20 years concurrent with the sentences imposed for counts one through four. Defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief. He presented both double jeopardy and ineffective assistance of counsel arguments. The trial court denied the petition, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the denial of the petition, as defendant's appellate counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to raise a double jeopardy argument, nor did counsel render ineffective assistance in failing to challenge the split sentence imposed for the conviction on one of the counts of murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners' property abutted a county road. The road was used only by the Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and petitioners, and their guests. Petitioners attempted to vacate the part of the road abutting their property. Respondent Brown County Board of Commissioners wanted to vacate the whole road, or none of it. The Forest Service did not support vacation of the whole road. Respondent denied the petition since it did not benefit the County. The trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction of the appeal, since Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-3-12(f) was more specific and more recent than Ind. Code &sect; 36-2-2-27. This case was not the taking of private property involving a constitutional right. Petitioners did not show harm by a governmental act or change in the status quo depriving them of a statutory or constitutional right, and thus there was not a nonstatutory appeal right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that since the status quo was maintained, there was no harm to petitioners, and the trial court did not have statutory subject matter jurisdiction of petitioners' appeal, petitioners did not have the right to appeal the denial of a road vacation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder, attempted murder, and other offenses. The trial court ordered that defendant present evidence of Battered Women's Syndrome (BWS) under the Effects of Battery statute,&nbsp;Ind.

Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal. The court held the trial court did not abuse its discretion with respect to admission of the BWS evidence. The court found that to the extent involuntary behavior of defendant was contended to result from a mental disease, the state insanity statute applied. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to present evidence as to her mental state without pursuing an insanity defense. The court held the trial court properly excluded the videotape. The court found the videotape's probative value to show dissociative conduct by defendant was minimal, and the potential of the videotape to prejudice the jury against the victim exceeded its probative value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision, because the trial court did not abuse discretion in ruling defendant could not introduce Battered Women's Syndrome evidence unless she did so pursuant to the Effects of Battery statute, and the probative value of the videotape in question to show dissociative conduct by defendant was minimal.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 20-8.1-3-34, the Compulsary Attendance Act, in the Howard Superior Court (Indiana), alleging that the authority delegated to local school corporations to establish attendance policies, the violation of which subjected a parent to criminal liability, was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative function.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the mother and custodial parent of an elementary school student. The school corporation's attendance policy provided, inter alia, that after a student accumulated 20 unexcused absences, the county prosecutor was notified by school officials. Upon notification that the student had accumulated 23 absences, the State charged defendant with violating the Compulsory Attendance Act, Ind. Code &sect; 20-8.1-3-34. Following a bench trial, defendant was found guilty and sentenced. Defendant appealed, arguing that the legislature, by permitting Indiana's school districts to establish their own attendance polices, had impermissibly delegated the purely legislative function of defining the elements and acts which constitute criminal activity to the individual school attendance districts. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the General School Powers Act, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 25-5-1 to -6, was not unconstitutional because the discretion whether to prosecute a parent lay solely with the prosecutor.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been convicted of child molesting and attempted child molesting.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant's probation. Defendant contended that Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-2-2.4, the statute that formed the basis for the &quot;no contact&quot; provision of his probation agreement, was unconstitutionally vague and unconstitutionally overbroad. No reasonable person of ordinary intelligence would have had difficulty determining that intentional interaction with and physical touching of the boy was proscribed by &sect; 35-38-2-2.4. It was inherent in &sect; 35-38-2-2.4 that a probationer was not required to avoid inadvertent or unintentional contact with persons less than 16 years of age.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from conviction for nonsupport of a dependent. Defendant waived his claim that Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-46-1-5(a) was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. His ex post facto claim failed. The record showed he provided his children only a few items of clothing and paid minimal support during the relevant time. Defendant earned enough during that time to pay his support obligation. Defendant admitted that he chose not to pay support while the arrearage accumulated, notwithstanding that he was spending significant amounts of money on nonessential items for his children. Defendant acknowledged that support payments were a low priority. He admitted to not filing tax returns because he knew any refund would be intercepted for support. Defendant waived any objections to closing argument by not raising them immediately. There was strong evidence of guilt. The sentencing statement should have explained why less than the presumptive sentence was imposed upon defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment convicting and sentencing defendant for nonsupport of a dependent was affirmed in part and remanded in part. There was strong evidence of defendant's guilt, including his own testimony. However, the sentencing decision to impose less than the presumptive time on defendant was not adequately explained. Remanded for explanation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied class certification, and plaintiff filed an interlocutory appeal. The court held the trial court improperly denied class certification. The court held plaintiffs fulfilled all requirements of Ind. Trial R. 23(A), including numerosity, common questions of law and fact, typical claims and defenses, and fair and adequate protection of the interests of the class. The court held plaintiffs were not required to exhaust administrative remedies. The issues presented were pure questions of law, as plaintiffs argued the administrative agency did not have authority to declare the test invalid, or award a diploma without passing the graduation test.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the judgment was affirmed with respect to the welfare fraud conviction and the restitution order, but the matter was remanded to the trial court with instructions to vacate the theft conviction. The trial court had found appellant guilty of both welfare fraud and theft. While appellant had only been sentenced for welfare fraud, the theft conviction was not vacated. &quot;Merger&quot; of the convictions was inadequate; the &quot;merged&quot; offense had to be vacated.

Appellants consisted of out-of-state commercial motor carriers who paid tax for fuel used based upon the miles they drove within Indiana. The court affirmed the dismissal of appellants' suit, finding that the relevant portions of Ind. Code &sect; 6-6-4.1-1 et seq. and the International Fuel Tax Agreement did not exempt appellants from seeking a claim for refund from appellee before seeking judicial review. Also, the court found that because appellants' class action suit asked for a tax refund, until each member complied with the administrative requirements, no court had subject matter jurisdiction over their cause of action.</SPAN></P>

Appellee argued that individuals with higher incomes who drive sport utility vehicles and trucks were not subject to stops for not wearing seatbelts. Consequently, individuals who could not afford sport utility vehicles, such as the appellee, were denied equal protection. The court, however, held that the disparate treatment in the seatbelt enforcement statute was reasonably related to inherent characteristics, which distinguished the unequally treated classes.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, although plaintiff's daughter was under 23 years of age, she was not enrolled in an institution of higher learning or vocational program and was thus not deemed a child for purposes of the Act. The fact that the daughter was previously enrolled in such an institution and intended to pursue a degree did not constitute enrollment under the Act, and evidence of such intent was properly excluded. Further, the Act did not violate Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, as an unequal treatment of different classes because it was rationally related to young persons dependent on their parents while pursuing an education and the Act was equally applicable to all members of that class.</SPAN></P>
