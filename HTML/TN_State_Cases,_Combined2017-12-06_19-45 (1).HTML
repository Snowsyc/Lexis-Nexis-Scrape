</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Circuit Court for Williamson County, Tennessee, jury convicted defendant of 7 counts of aggravated sexual battery, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-504(a)(4), and 1 count of especially aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-1005. He was sentenced to 96 years in prison. He filed a direct appeal and also pursued interlocutory review to bar future prosecution of 3 severed child-rape charges, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-522 (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the trial errors cited by defendant did not require reversal of his convictions, his 96-year sentence (eight 12-year consecutive sentences), while permissible under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-115(b)(5) (2003), was not reasonably related to the severity of his offenses. The circumstances of the case required modification of his effective sentence from 96 years to 36 years. The judge who presided at defendant's trial was disqualified from conducting further proceedings in the case because of his punitive reaction toward trial counsel's comments about trial error, his failure to place on the record his findings and reasons for denying defendant's motion to recuse, his restrictions of defendant's right of discovery, and his credibility-bolstering of the victim-witness. The child-rape offenses were improperly severed under the criteria of Tenn. R. Crim. P. 8(a)(1)(A) and 14(b)(2)(A), and were barred from future prosecution by the principles of double jeopardy under U.S. Const. amend. V and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, because the rape charges were included within the broad time frame alleged in the indictment and the time frame specified in the bill of particulars.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's effective sentence was modified to 36 years, but defendant's convictions and sentences were otherwise affirmed. The State was barred from proceeding further on the three counts of child rape, and those charges were dismissed. The judge who presided at trial was disqualified from conducting further proceedings in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of especially aggravated robbery. The trial court sentenced him to 22 years in prison. His conviction and sentence were upheld on direct appeal. The trial court denied petitioner postconviction relief on the ground that his petition was untimely. On appeal, petitioner argued that he was entitled to postconviction relief based on newly discovered evidence in the alleged form of a photographic lineup when his mother discovered the same in his criminal records filed at the county clerk's office. The court found that the photographic lineup could not be construed as scientific evidence. The court could not conclude that the particular factual circumstances tolled the limitations period. The postconviction petition was not filed until well beyond the one-year statute of limitations in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(a). The grounds for relief alleged by petitioner did not fall within any of the exceptions to the statute of limitations in &sect; 40-30-102(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal Court for Loudon County (Tennessee) of assault, resisting arrest, and obstruction of the execution of an arrest warrant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that officers could only enter a residence with both an arrest warrant and a reasonable belief that the person they were seeking was located therein. Second, defendant claimed that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on defendant's affirmative defense of use of force in her home when the defendant reasonably believed that law enforcement officers were unlawfully entering her home without a search warrant, exigent circumstances, or an arrest warrant coupled with the reasonable belief that the person they sought was in her home. The court of appeals disagreed. The State responded that the trial court did not err because the jury was properly instructed on self-defense and no further special instructions were submitted to the trial court in writing. Because Tenn. R. Crim. P. 30 envisioned that requests be made in writing, oral requests for instructions were not sufficient for the court of appeals to find that the trial court's instructions were improper. Therefore, the trial court did not err by denying defendant's oral proposal of jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer, while on routine patrol about 2:00 a.m., drove into the parking lot of a public park. The parking lot was not gated and had only one access road. The officer noticed a car parked at the far end of the parking lot. As the officer drove toward the car, its headlights came on, and it started to drive off toward the entrance of the park. The officer activated his blue lights, stopped the car, and discovered defendant in the driver's seat. Defendant was subsequently arrested and convicted of DUI. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that the parking lot was a premises generally frequented by the public at large. Even if after-hours patrons of the park went there to conduct illegal activity and even though the going itself was a misdemeanor, there was nothing in the proscription of DUI that required that those who frequented a property had to be somehow cross-representative of the general public. Further, when defendant saw the approach of the police cruiser and began to drive toward the parking lot's exit in an impaired state, he attempted to commit DUI pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-12-101(a)(3) (2003).</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the postconviction court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's request for a continuance of an evidentiary hearing, based on the resignation of one of the attorneys assigned to his case, because the attorney resigned three months before the hearing, and the remaining attorney offered no reasonable explanation why three months was an insufficient amount of time to review any work performed by the resigning attorney, especially given the fact that the remaining attorney had already been involved in the case for over a year. Defendant failed to show that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to exercise a peremptory challenge or challenge for cause a particular juror, after the juror wrote a letter to the judge and asked to be released based due to the fact that his practice would suffer in his absence and that he was pro-prosecution and pro-death penalty because at no time during the judge's questioning of the juror did he mention his view of capital punishment and defendant stated he had no objection to the juror.</SPAN></P>

However, the applicant withdrew these claims and sought to proceed on his claims raised in the amended petition. Thus, following the remand, the applicant abandoned the issue which the appellate court had directed be resolved and instead, embarked with an entirely new claim. The appellate court found that the applicant's withdrawing of the claims which were to be reviewed following the remand resulted in the habeas corpus court having nothing to review. The new claims, set out in the amended petition, were outside the remand instructions from the appellate court and thus, not properly before the habeas corpus court. Also, the habeas corpus court properly dismissed the petition for writ of error coram nobis, because the applicant sought to present evidence which was not &quot;newly discovered.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner was sentenced to 11 months, 29 days, with all but 65 days suspended on supervised probation. The appellate court found that the petitioner's motion to alter or amend did not toll the commencement of the thirty-day period in which to file a notice of appeal. However, in the interest of justice, the appellate court waived the untimely notice and reviewed the petitioner's issues on the merits. The appellate court found that the petitioner had not proven that he was presently confined or restrained of his liberty under a void judgment or an expired sentence. The Tennessee habeas corpus statutes were clear that the petitioner seeking habeas relief must be in either actual or constructive custody of the sentence being challenged because the term &quot;restrained of liberty&quot; required either actual or constructive custody. The petitioner's sentence had expired prior to his appeal, and quite simply, habeas relief was not proper to the petitioner. Also, it was settled that the petitioner could waive his right to presentment, indictment, or impeachment.</SPAN></P>

Without holding an evidentiary hearing, the coram nobis court dismissed the petition, and the petitioner currently brought an appeal challenging the action. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, stating that the petition was properly denied without an evidentiary hearing because the first and third prong of the Mixon factors for determining the viability of a coram nobis petition had not been met. The inmate did not bolster his petition with any sworn statement of the witness who allegedly stated that he lied; the inmate merely alleged via a sworn statement from third parties that the witness had disclaimed his sworn resentencing hearing testimony. Moreover, the record was devoid of any claim of corroboration that the witness's recantation was truthful and that his resentencing hearing testimony was false. Additionally, different testimony by the witness would not have affected the imposition of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

P. 37, he reserved four certified questions of law relating to whether the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress because the traffic stop and subsequent search were unconstitutional. Finding no error, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The appellate court stated that although it was clear that defendant was &quot;seized&quot; within the meaning of U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, the questioning of defendant and the inquiry into his driver's license documentation did not exceed proper perimeters and create an unreasonable detention. Given the evidence elicited during the investigation, defendant's demeanor, and his lack of candor about being on probation for prior drug offenses, he was not unreasonably detained. Additionally, the officer had reasonable suspicion to conduct the search. Defendant was driving in the highest crime area in the county, he was nervous, and he was a known drug dealer and user who was on probation for drug offenses at the time of the stop.</SPAN></P>

The inmate failed to prove that he had deficits in adaptive behavior as the trial court correctly determined that little weight should be given to the inmate's below average score on the independent living scale, as the inmate had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and there was no indication that the testing questions took into account his lifestyle in Vietnam, his difficulty communicating in English, or the fact that he spent the majority of his adult life in jail.

The jury had found the presence of two statutory aggravating circumstances and had found that the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murdering the victim, his estranged girlfriend. The court agreed with the trial court that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated when the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant was advised of his Miranda rights and, although intoxicated, was sufficiently aware of his surroundings to understand and consent to a waiver of those rights. Evidence was sufficient for the jury to infer that defendant's conduct was premeditated, as required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202(a)(1). The evidence showed, in part, that defendant ambushed the victim at work, secured a weapon prior to the murder and later concealed the weapon, and fired numerous rounds at the victim. It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to admit pictures of the crime scene and of the autopsy. When considering whether defendant's prior conviction for reckless endangerment qualified as a prior violent felony for purposes of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(2), it was error for the trial court to consider the affidavit of complaint pertaining to the prior conviction. The court could not conclude that the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction for first degree murder. The court reversed the imposition of the death sentence and remanded the matter for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Dickson County (Tennessee) convicted petitioner inmate of burglary. The trial court summarily dismissed the inmate's petition for habeas corpus relief. The inmate appealed the trial court's summary dismissal of his petition. The State filed a motion requesting that the appellate court affirm the trial court's denial of relief pursuant to Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's habeas petition alleged that his guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered because he received the ineffective assistance of counsel. He also alleged that his sentence was unconstitutionally imposed. The inmate first alleged that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel which rendered his guilty plea involuntary and unknowing. Those allegations, if true, would render the convictions and sentences voidable, but not void. If the allegations in a petition for habeas corpus relief did not demonstrate that the judgment was void, the trial court could correctly dismiss the petition without a hearing. In addition, the Tennessee Supreme Court determined that the Blakely decision did not announce a new rule of law and that Tennessee's sentencing structure, under which the inmate was sentenced, did not violate the inmate's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Finally, the appellate court had previously held that Blakely did not apply retroactively to cases on collateral appeal. Thus, the trial court did not err by summarily dismissing the inmate's habeas corpus petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Hardin County (Tennessee), which, upon a jury verdict, convicted him of possession of cocaine over point five (0.5) grams with intent to sell, in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-417(c)(1), and possession of marijuana, in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-418(a) (2003). Defendant was sentenced to twenty-five years and eleven months and twenty-nine days imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman claimed that she was a guest at the hotel and consented to the officers' search of the room in which several people, including defendant, were located. Officers found drug paraphernalia, crack cocaine, and marijuana. The woman testified that she observed defendant selling drugs to various individuals. Defendant claimed that the woman did not have authority to consent to the search and filed a motion to suppress. On appeal, the court found that the officers had valid consent to search the room and that defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 were not violated. The occupants in the room verified that the woman was staying in the room, and the officers smelled marijuana and observed the paraphernalia in plain sight. The officers reasonably believed that the woman had the authority to consent to the search. The evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction. Defendant was in a motel room with several other individuals who were smoking crack cocaine and marijuana, and witnesses testified that defendant supplied and sold drugs. The trial court properly considered the sentencing principles and did not err in sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued, inter alia, that counsel was ineffective for failing to conduct an adequate investigation of petitioner's family background and mental condition, which precluded the diagnosis of a bipolar disorder. The court of appeals disagreed. While additional mitigation evidence existed in the form of additional information from family members and friends, the introduction of such information to the jury would not have all been beneficial mitigating evidence. The information highlighted a long history of drug abuse and illegal activity. Although such missing information would have been beneficial to a reviewing mental health expert, had the expert witness been in possession of such information he would not necessarily have made the same diagnosis, and the impact of such a diagnosis would not have had such effect upon the jury as to alter the outcome. Counsel was not deficient for relying upon the pre-trial evaluation finding that petitioner was competent and sane. In light of the results of the court-ordered evaluation, there would have most likely been no success in seeking additional funds to further explore an insanity defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a former police officer, appealed from a judgment of the Sumner County Criminal Court (Tennessee) that convicted him of official misconduct under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-402, aggravated assault under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-13-102 and 39-11-402(2); and aggravated burglary under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-14-404(a); and that sentenced him to 15 years in prison as a Range I offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-402, and raised numerous claims of error. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, but reversed his sentence because the record contained evidence of several mitigating factors but no indication that they were considered by the trial court. Also the trial court erred by applying the use of a deadly weapon enhancement factor to defendants' official misconduct and aggravated burglary convictions. The court found that defendant's convictions were supported by sufficient evidence that showed he had schemed with the other participants to attack the victim, and that the other participants entered the victim's home and beat him with a stick, which caused serious injures, while defendant used his police radio to ensure that no one called the police. The court held that &sect; 39-16-402 was not unconstitutionally vague because it sufficiently put defendant on notice of the charges against him and of what conduct was prohibited. The court rejected defendant's claims of error as to hearsay or prior bad act evidence, the denial of pretrial diversion, and the State's election of offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, but reversed defendant's sentence and remanded the case for new sentencing. Upon remand, the trial court was instructed to clearly indicate on the record the enhancing and mitigating factors that were applicable to each conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Criminal Court for Hamilton County (Tennessee), which convicted him of first-degree premeditated murder in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202(a) (2003), first-degree felony murder, attempted especially aggravated burglary, and theft of property valued over $ 10,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences, but the court affirmed, stating that the proof in his case did not support the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter. There was no evidence introduced that defendant killed the victim in a state of passion produced by adequate provocation to lead a reasonable person to act in an irrational manner. And, even if it should have been charged, the failure to do was harmless. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's motion for a change of venue under Tenn. R. Crim. P. 21 because the record contained no evidence from which the appellate court could conclude that the jurors were tainted. Defendant failed to prove that any pretrial publicity utterly corrupted the trial atmosphere. Pursuant to Tenn. R. Evid. 402, the trial court did not err in admitting a knife into evidence because it was relevant under Tenn. R. Evid. 401 to show where defendant might have obtained the murder weapon. The State was properly permitted to present a theory regarding the origin of the murder weapon and evidence to support that theory. Photographs were properly admitted to reconstruct the crime scene and were not overly graphic.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two petitioners were each found to be habitual criminals and, as a result, were serving sentences of life imprisonment in the Tennessee Department of Correction. On appeal, the petitioners argued that their habitual criminal convictions were illegal and void because Tennessee's habitual criminal statute was unconstitutional in its application. The petitioners alleged that the crimes for which they were convicted, and which resulted in their convictions as habitual criminals, occurred after the enactment of the Tennessee Sentencing Reform Act of 1982, and as such, they argued that they should have been sentenced as persistent offenders under the 1982 Act rather than under the habitual criminal statute. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's summary dismissal of the petitions. The Tennessee Sentencing Reform Act of 1982 contained the express provision that nothing in the Act would prohibit the operation of the Habitual Criminal Act. The Tennessee Legislature was within its authority to impose imprisonment beyond the maximum for the offense committed for those hardened offenders who had not been deterred from a life of crime by prior conviction and punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Criminal Court for Campbell County (Tennessee), which convicted him of five counts of sexual battery, and five counts of aggravated sexual battery in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-504(a)(4) (2003). He was sentenced to one year for each sexual battery and eight years for each aggravated sexual battery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his five counts of sexual battery and five counts of aggravated sexual battery. The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court but remanded for entry of corrected judgments to reflect that Counts 3 and 5 were consecutive to Counts 1 and 2. Defendant not only failed to request any lesser-included offense instructions pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-18-110 (2003), he objected to the State's requested lesser-included instructions. He further failed to show that he did not waive that issue for tactical reasons and the trial court's failure to instruct on the lesser-included offenses did not rise to the level of plain error. Additionally, the trial court gave a proper unanimity instruction and any error in the jury instructions was harmless because the jury reached a proper verdict and the alternative convictions were properly merged by the trial court. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions because the victim's testimony revealed that defendant, her grandfather, toucher her breasts under her child. She also testified about numerous occasions wherein defendant sexually touched her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying the motion to suppress because personal items were illegally seized as a result of the pat down which exceeded the scope of his consent. The court of appeals disagreed. The officers could have justified a warrantless search of the room based on the smell of methamphetamine alone based on the exigent circumstances created by the dangers associated with methamphetamine production. The officers arrived on the scene after reports of the smell of &quot;ether&quot; coming from defendant's room. When defendant opened the door and squeezed himself out, the officers could smell the strong chemical smell coming from the room. Defendant acted strange, telling them that he had come all the way from Florida with no wallet and no identification. While the officers procured a search warrant for the hotel room prior to their search which resulted in the discovery of a multitude of items used in the production of methamphetamine and some actual methamphetamine, they would have been justified in searching the room without a warrant based on the dangerous exigent circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted in the Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) of aggravated rape, kidnapping, and first degree murder and was sentenced to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued, inter alia, that the postconviction court erred by denying his petition to show that a third-party committed the murder. The court of appeals disagreed. While the petitioner placed great emphasis upon &quot;redundant DNA results,&quot; the &quot;redundant results&quot; analysis did not differ from an individual determination as to the &quot;favorable&quot; nature of each item's DNA testing results. In essence, the crux of the petitioner's request for consideration of &quot;redundant&quot; test results was that the absence of the petitioner's DNA from the samples established his innocence of the murder. The Tennessee Post-Conviction DNA Analysis Act of 2001 did not envision DNA testing of third-party individuals nor did it contemplate a new investigation for a speculative phantom defendant. In addition, there was overwhelming evidence against the petitioner including his confession, his leading the police to the locale of the body, and the victim's hair found in the petitioner's vehicle. Therefore, the post-conviction court did not err by denying the petitioner's requested relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted for killing the eight-year-old victim after raping her. On appeal, the court held that the fact that one juror read Bible passage aloud and another juror recited a prayer during deliberations during sentencing did not violate defendant's right to an impartial jury because they were not extraneous prejudicial information. A literal reading of the Bible passage showed that it did not mention imposition of the death penalty, or any other punishment related to murder, or any other specific crimes; its theme was that one should follow the laws of the civil government who rules. Given the victim's horrific murder, the court could not conclude that the typical juror would not have imposed the death penalty absent the reading of the Bible passage and/or the prayer. The court further held that the inmate failed to show that the postconviction court was biased, as his displeasure with the outcome of the hearing was insufficient, and that despite the inmate's argument to the contrary, the postconviction court considered all of the testimony presented, including mitigation evidence. The inmate's ineffective assistance of counsel claims were rejected.</SPAN></P>

He alleged that the convictions were facially invalid and void due to the trial court's imposition of concurrent sentences. At the time of the appellant's 1989 convictions, the statute of limitations applicable to post-conviction proceedings was three years under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 (1986) (repealed 1995). In order to comply with the statute of limitations, the appellant had until July 1992 to file for post-conviction relief. The post-conviction court summarily dismissed the petition as time-barred; he was not denied his right to due process of law because he had three years to file the petition. Appellant had previously sought and been denied habeas corpus relief. The post-conviction court did not err by refusing to treat the appellant's petition as one seeking habeas corpus relief. Appellant was incarcerated in Johnson County, Tennessee, while the post-conviction court was in Davidson County, Tennessee; therefore, jurisdiction was not proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment. The appellate court found that the judgment of conviction entered on July 28, 2005, failed to, by itself, properly reserve a certified question of law. It failed to incorporate by reference the plea agreement which set out defendant's certified question. The judgment of conviction instead incorporated by reference a subsequent order which was to set forth the parameters of defendant's certified question. Defendant filed his notice of appeal, and five days later, the trial court filed a supplemental order which purported to contain defendant's certified question. Once the notice of appeal was filed, the jurisdiction of the appellate court attached, and, correlatively, the trial court lost jurisdiction. Therefore, the attempt to cure the defect in the judgment with a supplemental order was a nullity. Even if the supplemental order had been filed in a timely fashion, it would not have served the dictates of Tenn. R. Crim. P. 37 as the wording did not clearly identify the scope or limits of the issue reserved and did not serve to properly reserve defendant's certified question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner argued, inter alia, that counsel was ineffective for failing to prepare for trial adequately because he should have procured the surveillance tapes from a store, which he argued would have disputed the testimony of the arresting officer. The petitioner also claimed that his attorney did not prepare adequately for the testimony of certain witnesses. The court of appeals disagreed. In its order denying the petitioner postconviction relief, the trial court noted that the petitioner's attorney did not do anything to prejudice the petitioner. The record reflected that the store's surveillance tapes were reused before the petitioner's attorney was able to obtain them and that the petitioner's attorney adequately prepared for the trial. The record did not preponderate against the trial court's finding, and the petitioner was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

At that point, the patrol car, with its blue lights on, was within feet of defendant's vehicle and partially blocking its exit from the parking space. Under those circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave. The officer's decision to make the investigatory stop was based upon reasonable suspicion supported by specific and articulable facts. The radio dispatch reported that a black Jeep traveling toward Monteagle with a Florida license place and identified tag number &quot;was weaving all over the roadway.&quot; A vehicle generally matching that description was observed within minutes of the dispatch traveling toward Monteagle. The same vehicle nearly impacted the officer's patrol car on the motel parking lot. Those facts were sufficient to permit an investigative stop of defendant's vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Although the information contained in the affidavit was insufficient to support a finding of probable cause because the affidavit was devoid of evidence linking the rifle to the shooting, the trial court's error in not suppressing the fired shell casings, fired bullets, or color photographs of defendant's residence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant's father purchased a MAK-90 rifle, which was a 7.62 by 39 caliber weapon and its instruction manual was entered as an exhibit and used by several witnesses to identify defendant's gun. A witness said that defendant used an AK-47 which looked like the gun in the booklet exhibit. An agent testified that the bullets and shell casings were 7.62 by 39 and could have been fired from a MAK-90 rifle, and a witness saw defendant with an assault rifle around the time the shooting occurred. Therefore, any error in the denial of the motion to suppress was harmless.</SPAN></P>

Although she specifically denied any involvement with or participation in the attempted robbery or murder, she responded positively to questions, which, when considered along with the victim's dying declaration and the identification of defendant as the driver of the getaway car, tended to establish the her guilt. The trial court properly admitted defendant's video-taped statement as an admission against interest under Tenn. R. Evid. 803(1.2)(A).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) denied petitioner inmate's motion requesting relief from an invalid sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Retrospective application of the rule in Blakely to cases on collateral review was not required. Accordingly, the inmate failed to establish a ground that would toll the statute of limitations. The inmate had filed prior petitions for post-conviction relief; thus, the appellate court could construe the pleading as a motion to reopen a petition for post-conviction relief. However, even treating the pleading as such, it failed. The appeal failed as the inmate had not satisfied the procedural requirements for vesting jurisdiction in the appellate court. The appeal was not filed within 10 days of the trial court's ruling, no application for permission to appeal was filed, and the notice of appeal was filed in the trial court, not the appellate court. Also, the inmate failed to allege a ground under which a petition for post-conviction relief could be reopened. Further, the claims regarding sentencing were voidable, not void, and the Blakely holding was not to be applied retroactively. In addition, if treated as an application for habeas corpus relief, the application was filed in the wrong court. Thus, the inmate failed to establish that he was entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of two counts of felony murder and two counts of attempted felony murder, with the latter being reversed and dismissed. In November 1999, he filed a petition for postconviction relief, which, according to the inmate, was dismissed for failure to prosecute. Additionally, he alleged that the court denied, on January 25, 2002, his motion to reconsider the dismissal. On January 19, 2005, he filed a motion to reopen his postconviction petition. The court affirmed the postconviction court's denial, stating that even if the court construed the notice of appeal as adequate to get the matter before the court, it was untimely and the court was without jurisdiction to consider it pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-117(c) and Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 28, &sect; 10(B). The court further stated that even if the appeal was timely, it was without merit. The only &quot;facts&quot; alleged by the inmate was that a ballistics report would have proven that he did not shoot anyone or had a weapon used in the crime. Such findings would have been contrary to the facts that were the basis of the inmate's convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that counsel was not ineffective for not objecting to the victim's competency because the victim's confusion over details did not address his competency but went to the weight and value of his testimony. Petitioner also failed to show that counsel's cross-examination of witnesses was deficient in that counsel cross-examined the victim's grandmother at length about conflicting statements and counsel's cross-examination of the officer was reasonable in light of counsel's trial strategy. The court also found that counsel's inability to secure telephone records petitioner claimed would show petitioner was in a different area when the injuries allegedly occurred did not reflect deficient conduct. Further, counsel believed that interviewing the doctor prior to trial was unnecessary given that the trial strategy was based on petitioner's alibi defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision of the Criminal Court for Knox County (Tennessee) dismissing a presentment charging defendant with the rape of a five-year-old child at a day care under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-522. Following a mistrial, the State filed a &quot;Superceding Bill of Particulars,&quot; which reverted back to the general time frame of the presentment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State based the times of the offense in the bill of particulars on the day care's attendance records. After the mistrial, the State's superseding bill of particulars broadened the time in which the offense occurred because the defense provided new evidence during discovery that suggested that the child arrived at day care 35 minutes earlier than the time alleged in the bill of particulars. The court reversed, and held that given that there was no clearly defined procedure in Tenn. R. Crim. P. 7(b) for amending a bill of particulars, the fact that the State did not file a motion for permission to supercede the bill did not result in the issues being waived on appeal. The original bill set out its allegations as to when the offense took place but were not admissions as to the accuracy of allegations of fact made by defendant. Finally, the court held that there was no question of defense counsel's having been surprised by the time discrepancy, and &quot;prejudice,&quot; did not occur simply because defendant lost an advantage earlier gained from a prosecution mistake. The appropriate action would have been to determine whether the variance was both material and prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal Court for Anderson County, Tennessee, indicted defendant for one count of vehicular homicide by intoxication, a Class B felony, and one count of vehicular homicide by recklessness, a Class C felony. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to suppress. It claimed that defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the equipment or safety features of defendant's vehicle. The appellate court noted that it did not believe the statement in the notice of appeal constituted evidence of the fact asserted. The State actually suppressed only the evidence obtained by the tapping of the internal record contained in the computer module. Because the air bag sensor module would not show defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant or had a blood alcohol concentration of .08% or higher, the first count of the indictment charging vehicular homicide by intoxication had to have been based on evidence in addition to the air bag sensor module. The State's assertion in its notice of appeal was not supported by the record. Nothing in the record existed to indicate that the suppression of the information taken from the air bag sensor module effectively resulted in the dismissal of either count of the indictment. The State failed to establish any factors allowing a Tenn. R. App. P. 10 extraordinary appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioner challenged the judgment of the Criminal Court for Shelby County, Tennessee, denying his motion to reopen his postconviction petition or in the alternative, requesting habeas corpus relief.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner entered guilty pleas to four counts of attempt to commit murder in the first degree, two counts of especially aggravated robbery, and six counts of aggravated robbery.

In April 2005, the petitioner filed a motion to reopen his postconviction petition. The motion was dismissed on April 28, 2005, and the petitioner filed a notice of appeal on May 12, 2005. The appellate court ruled that if the petitioner's pleading was treated as a motion to reopen a petition for postconviction relief, the petitioner's appeal failed. The petitioner failed to comply with the statutory requirements for seeking appellate review under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-117(c) (2003). Petitioner filed his application in the wrong court, and the notice of appeal was filed more than ten days after entry of the trial court's order.

The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant told an officer that on the night of the shooting, he was in an apartment complex and near the G building. A witness was ninety to ninety-five percent certain that the male she gave a cigarette to near that building was defendant. Defendant told the police that at the time of the shooting, he was standing in the parking lot and the victim was standing near the sidewalk. Another witness testified that when he first saw the victim, she was lying partially on the sidewalk, and a shell casing was found in the parking lot. Defendant said the gun was a nine millimeter, and an officer testified that the shell casing recovered from the crime scene was a nine millimeter. Defendant told police that he shot the victim as the victim turned away from him, and the evidence showed that the victim was shot in the back. Therefore, defendant's confession was sufficiently corroborated by other evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Circuit Court for Dyer County, Tennessee, the defendant pled guilty to one count of incest, a Class C felony, in exchange for a negotiated eight-year sentence as a Range II, multiple offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a Tenn. R. Crim. P. 35 pro se motion for reduction of sentence, seeking relief from his eight-year sentence for incest. Defendant alleged, inter alia, that he did not timely learn that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-503(c) required him to obtain certification from a psychiatrist that he would not commit further sexual assaults before he could be released on parole. He challenged the statute on equal protection grounds under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The intermediate appellate court held that he was not entitled to relief. It was reasonable for the legislature to treat sexual offenders differently based on the nature of their offenses and its concerns for public safety. The fact that the defendant did not learn of the sexual offender requirements for parole until after sentencing, and that his mother's health had deteriorated since the time of his guilty plea, did not permit modification of his sentence in the interest of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1999 the applicant was convicted of one count of vehicular homicide by intoxication, and sentenced to twelve years confinement. No direct appeal was taken. Four and one-half years after entry of his conviction, the applicant filed a petition for writ of error coram nobis. This application was denied, and the denial was affirmed. Next, the applicant sought habeas corpus relief, alleging that his conviction was void because of defects in the indictment. The trial court denied relief and the decision was affirmed. Most recently, the applicant sought postconviction relief, the petition was dismissed as time-barred, and the decision was affirmed. In 2005 the applicant filed a pro se motion to declare Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-114&nbsp;unconstitutional, and in support of his motion relied upon the Blakely decision. The appellate court ruled that the applicant had not established that he was entitled to habeas corpus relief. Also, the appellate court was not vested with jurisdiction to entertain a request for an appeal of a denial of a motion to reopen a postconviction petition. Furthermore, if treated as a Tenn. R. Crim. P. 35(b) motion for reduction of sentence, the claim was time-barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On June 17, 1999, the inmate pled guilty to attempted rape and failure to appear. The trial court sentenced the inmate to ten years for the attempted rape conviction and four years for the failure to appear conviction, and it ordered that these sentences run consecutively for an effective sentence of fourteen years. On July 15, 2005, the inmate filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief, which the post-conviction court dismissed after finding that the petition was untimely. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the inmate's petition because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(b) (2003) required that a petition for post-conviction relief be filed within one year from final judgment, and the inmate's petition was filed six years later. Additionally, the inmate did not meet any of the exceptions to the limitation period set forth in &sect;&nbsp;40-30-102(b)(1)- (3). Additionally, as Blakely v. Washington did not provide a new rule of constitutional law, it did not provide a basis for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of two counts of aggravated burglary, one count of theft of property valued over $ 1,000 but less than $ 10,000, and one count of aggravated robbery. For those convictions, the inmate received an effective sentence of 15 years' incarceration. He filed an application for habeas corpus relief. The inmate did not contend that his sentences had expired; thus, he was only entitled to relief if his judgments were void. In his petition submitted to the trial court, the inmate challenged the voluntary nature of his guilty pleas and the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-501(l)(2). The appellate court held that those claims did not entitle the inmate to habeas corpus relief. First, the inmate's assertion that his guilty plea was unknowing and involuntary was not cognizable in a habeas corpus action because even if true the judgment would be rendered voidable, not void. Next, the inmate's constitutional challenge to &sect; 40-35-501(l)(2) failed because there was no constitutional or inherent right to be conditionally released before the expiration of a prison sentence. Thus, the inmate failed to state a ground upon which habeas corpus relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of a judgment of the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which dismissed his pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner argued that he was entitled to habeas corpus relief because his sentences contravened Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-20-111(b) and Tenn. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3)(C). He also alleged that his sentences were unconstitutionally enhanced in violation of his right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pled guilty to one count of aggravated assault and two counts of attempted first degree murder. He was sentenced to three years for his aggravated assault conviction and 20 years for each of his attempted first degree murder convictions. His sentences were ordered to run concurrently. In his petition, he alleged that he was on bail from the aggravated assault charge at the time he committed the two offenses of attempted first degree murder. Therefore, he argued that his concurrent sentences were illegal and void because &sect; 40-20-111(b) and Rule 32(c)(3)(C) mandated consecutive sentencing under such circumstances. On appeal, the court determined that the habeas corpus court should not have dismissed his claims without the benefit of counsel or a hearing. It noted that if petitioner's allegations were proven, then his sentences were void and he was entitled to habeas corpus relief. The court also determined that petitioner's claim that his sentences were improperly enhanced in violation of his right to a jury trial was waived because he failed to present it in his habeas corpus petition and could not raise it for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted for burglarizing, raping, and killing the 62-year-old victim. On review, the court held that the inmate failed to allege a ground under which his petition for postconviction relief could be reopened and therefore affirmed the trial court's judgment. The inmate's claim of newly discovered evidence establishing that co-counsel had a conflict of interest failed to satisfy any of the three circumscribed grounds as provided in &sect; 40-30-117(a)(1-3), and due process did not create a fourth category under which the inmate could reopen his petition. The inmate's claim that the Deck v. Missouri case created a new rule of constitutional law warranting postconviction relief was rejected because retrospective application of the procedural rule announced in that case was not required, because the rule, while important for defendants, was not absolute for defendants. The case pronounced that routine shackling during the penalty phase of a capital trial, without a case-specific finding that security needs justified the shackling, violated a defendant's due process rights unless the State showed beyond a reasonable doubt that the shackling did not contribute to the verdict.</SPAN></P>

The procedural requirements for habeas corpus relief were mandatory and had to be scrupulously followed. An application for the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus could be summarily dismissed for the failure to attach the judgment forms, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-21-107(b)(2). The inmate did not contend that his sentences had expired; thus, he was only entitled to relief if his judgments were void. The inmate's claim that his convictions or sentences were void because he was sentenced in violation of Blakely failed as, even if such a violation had occurred, the violation would only render the judgment voidable, not void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate had been convicted in the Circuit Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, for aggravated kidnapping, especially aggravated robbery, especially aggravated burglary, and extortion. Subsequently, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which was summarily dismissed. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four allegations supporting grounds for relief, the inmate's petition generally alleged that his convictions were void because he was sentenced by a judge rather than by a jury and that his sentences were enhanced by a judge rather than a jury, in violation of his constitutional rights under both the federal and state constitutions for a trial by jury. The fifth allegation as a ground for relief was essentially an argument of law, which the appellate court found was contrary to well-established case law in Tennessee. With regard to the first four allegations, the appellate court held that under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-21-101 et seq., a habeas corpus petition could only be used to contest void judgments which were facially invalid because the convicting court was without jurisdiction or authority to sentence a defendant or if a petitioner's sentence had expired. The appellate court concluded that the inmate failed to provide any evidence to suggest that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict or sentence him, and the record was clear that his term of imprisonment had not yet expired; therefore, he was properly denied habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Counsel conducted an investigation and developed a mitigation theory to which they adhered. The testimony of the witnesses at the sentencing hearing supported counsel's investigation and development of the theory. Based on their investigation, counsel determined that the best mitigation defense was to show that the petitioner was &quot;a good guy&quot; and that the crime was out of character for him, that theory based upon the information provided by the petitioner and his family. There was no indication, by either the petitioner or his parents, that further investigation into the family history was necessary or would have been fruitful. Although much information specific to the petitioner's mother and father and not directly related to him was presented at the post-conviction hearing, that proof shadowed the mitigation theme of the defense at trial, i.e., that the petitioner was &quot;a good guy.&quot; Counsels' decision not to further investigate into the petitioner's background was reasonable based upon the information they had.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. The court of appeals disagreed. That defendant was driving a motor vehicle, and on a public road, were uncontroverted. Defendant contended in his brief that there was insufficient evidence presented to prove element three, that he was under the influence of an intoxicant. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, it established that the police responded to an accident involving defendant, and upon arriving at the scene the police questioned defendant, who smelled of alcohol and admitted that he had been drinking earlier in the day. The police officer on the scene subsequently administered two separate field sobriety tests, neither of which defendant completed successfully. Thereafter, defendant was placed under arrest and given a blood alcohol test, which showed that his blood alcohol content was .12, which was above the legal limit. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of DUI and DUI per se beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Under such circumstances, even an indictment that failed to allege the required mental state was still valid. The petitioner's indictment tracked both the language of the statute proscribing first degree murder of a child by aggravated child abuse, and the language of the relevant child abuse statutes. Furthermore, the indictment cited to the first degree murder statute, and that reference provided notice to the petitioner of the applicable mens rea, notice of the offense upon which to enter the judgment, and protection from subsequent prosecution on the same offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal Court for Hamilton County (Tennessee) denied defendant's motion for a corrected judgment and his petition for post-conviction relief arguing that his 1976 judgment should be corrected pursuant to Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1976 defendant believed he pled guilty to a misdemeanor, but the judgment showed he pled guilty to a felony. He petitioned to correct his sentence under Tenn. R. Crim. P. 36 and for post-conviction relief. The court denied relief, finding no clerical error and that the post-conviction relief claims were untimely. After considering if there were any grounds for sua sponte habeas relief, the court concluded that neither the conviction nor sentence was illegal. Defendant appealed. The denial of a Tenn. R. Crim. P. 36 motion to correct a judgment for a clerical error was not covered by Tenn. R. App. P. 3, so defendant did not have an appeal as of right. Even accepting that he had a right to appeal the denial of his motion, the records showed he pled guilty to a felony. Defendant sought post-conviction relief for a judgment that was executed almost 30 years ago. The court dismissed the petition as being barred by a three-year statute of limitations. Defendant's claim that his 1976 judgment was illegal was essentially a claim for habeas relief. The instant court found he was not being restrained of his liberty under the 1976 judgment and, thus, not entitled to habeas relief.</SPAN></P>

Defendant returned to his friends' van a short time later with blood on his face, saying that he had left the victim for dead and that it was gruesome. Moreover, there was evidence that defendant had been upset with the victim and angry that the victim had called him a &quot;snitch.&quot; Defendant conceded that proof of the victim's displeasure with defendant was introduced through other witnesses. Therefore, even if the trial court erred in excluding the calls in question, such error was harmless pursuant to Tenn. R. Crim. P. 52(a) and Tenn. R. App. P. 36(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus relief in the Circuit Court for Lake County (Tennessee) attacking the validity of his Montgomery County convictions for one count of evading arrest by motor vehicle, one count of theft of property over $ 1,000, one count of kidnapping, two counts of aggravated robbery, and one count of aggravated assault. The trial court summarily dismissed the petition. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the petition failed to comply with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-21-107(a). Petitioner failed to state whether the legality of the restraint had not already been adjudged upon a prior proceeding of the same character. Additionally, he failed to state whether the instant petition was his first application for the writ, or, if a previous application had been made, and he failed to attach a copy of the petition and proceedings thereon. Accordingly, the petition was properly dismissed for failure to comply with the procedural requirements. In addition for failing to comply with the statutory requirements, petitioner failed to file a petition that stated cognizable claims for habeas corpus relief. Again, he made various complaints, including that: (1) counsel was ineffective; (2) his guilty plea was involuntarily; (3) he was innocent; (4) the Department of Correction unconstitutionally altered his sentences; (5) the trial court unconstitutionally imposed fines; and (6) the sentences were imposed in violation of Blakely v. Washington. Those claims did not, even if proven, render the convictions void. Thus, the claims were not cognizable in a habeas corpus proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's motion was granted. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court summarily dismissed the petitioner's claim for relief. Blakely did not apply retroactively. There was nothing on the face of the record before the court to indicate that the petitioner's sentence was imposed in direct contravention of any statute. The statute of limitations for filing a post-conviction claim on the petitioner's conviction of open rebellion had long since passed under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102 (Supp. 1986).</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Although the petitioner's experts maintained that his mental retardation was a result of his mother's drinking of alcohol while she was pregnant, the proof in the record did not support that the petitioner's I.Q. was below seventy or that he had deficits in his adaptive behavior prior to age eighteen. Language, reading, writing, money concepts, and self-direction were the four basic areas examined to determine if there is a deficit in the conceptual area of adaptive functioning. A State's expert found that the petitioner had age appropriate functioning within the conceptual category and his social skills were intact and at or above the level suggested by measures of intellectual functioning. The expert concluded that the petitioner had no practical deficits in his activities of daily living. Accordingly, the petitioner did not meet the third prong of the test for mental retardation. Because the petitioner failed to prove that he was mentally retarded, he was not excluded from the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in granting coram nobis relief to defendants because there was sufficient evidence to convict each defendant even in the absence of the illegal conduct by an agent of stealing cocaine from the crime lab.

Although another officer observed defendants when they parked next to him, his testimony reflected that they were only parked for one to two minutes before leaving. The agent's role in the investigation and prosecution of the case was vital in obtaining convictions against defendants. The trial found that had the information regarding the agent's criminal acts and drug addiction been available to defendants, he could have been cross-examined regarding his drug use and criminal acts, his credibility could have been attacked, and alternate defenses might have been employed. A reasonable jury, informed of the agent's drug use and criminal acts, might have chosen to reject all or part of his testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner entered guilty pleas to three counts of rape, class B felonies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted in the Criminal Court for Loudon County (Tennessee) of theft of property. The petitioner filed an appeal from the order granting her postconviction relief, which allowed a delayed appeal, and from the order denying her amended motion for judgment of acquittal or, alternatively, a new trial. The State cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying her amended motion for judgment of acquittal, or alternatively, a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The State argued that the claim was not properly before the court of appeals because the petitioner was granted a delayed appeal and the trial court lost jurisdiction to hear the motion once the petitioner filed her notice of appeal. The court of appeals agreed with the State. The statute clearly did not allow both a delayed appeal and a motion for a new trial. Here, the trial court granted a delay appeal. As such, the petitioner was not also entitled to thirty days in which to file a motion for a new trial, and the trial court did not err in not granting such. The State, having been granted leave to appeal the petitioner's sentence, was free to file its notice of appeal when it did. Consequently, only the claims related to the petitioner's delayed appeal were properly before the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the State failed to prove separate and distinct violations of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-1003 and that his eleven convictions were multiplicitous. The court of appeals agreed. The indictment alleged that defendant committed the offenses between January 1 and July 13, 2002, and the State introduced into evidence a computer printout showing which websites defendant visited from May 20 to June 13, 2002. The printout also showed the dates and times defendant visited the websites. However, the State presented no evidence concerning which pictures came from which website or when defendant accessed each picture. A detective admitted that he could not determine which pictures came from which website and could not determine when the petitioner accessed each picture. Therefore, all of the pictures could have come from a single website and could have been automatically downloaded onto defendant's hard drive simultaneously. In other words, the State failed to prove that any time elapsed between accessing the pictures or that defendant formed a new intent as to each picture.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Clearly the jury determined that defendant &quot;intentionally or knowingly&quot; committed an assault and acted in such a way as to create a &quot;risk of death or injury&quot; to another person. Despite the fact that the trial court opted to set aside the conviction for aggravated assault, it was apparent from the verdict that the jury believed that defendant created a &quot;risk of death or injury.&quot; The State proved that the trial court's failure to instruct on Class E felony evading arrest did not affect the outcome of the trial. Under those circumstances, the jury, if given the option of Class E felony evading arrest, would not have abandoned its findings of a risk to third parties and convicted only of the Class E crime. Therefore, the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on Class E felony evading arrest was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed the order from the Criminal Court for Wilson County (Tennessee), which denied his post-conviction petition, wherein he sought relief from judgments convicting him of one count of premeditated first degree murder and one count of murder committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate aggravated child abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner smothered his baby, and she died. He told police that God had directed him to sacrifice his daughter. He signed a statement, which was read into evidence at trial, stating that he killed his child so that Christ could return. He was convicted. A panel of the court affirmed the judgment on direct appeal. He unsuccessfully sought post-conviction relief based on the absence of a jury instruction on the term &quot;wrongfulness,&quot; as used in an insanity defense. On appeal, he requested that the court define the term as suggested in the Graham court's opinion. The court found that the merit of the jury instruction issue was addressed on direct appeal when the court found that the instructions were complete. As such, the court found that the issue was precluded from its review under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-106(h) (2003). Further, the court found that absent any established definition of wrongfulness, petitioner's defense counsel properly relied on experts to provide explanations on various definitions and to opine as to why petitioner met the standards of the insanity defense. The court found that the fact that the strategy failed did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Criminal Court for Shelby County, Tennessee for first degree murder and sentence of death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another individual were involved in the robbery and murder of a victim. Defendant told the individual in a phone call that defendant's girlfriend knew too much and had to go. After she and defendant were heard fighting, the girlfriend's body was found. The court held that because defendant had filed several pro se motions, he was capable of filing a waiver had he been adamant about representing himself. Also, denying counsel's motion to withdraw was not error because it would have caused further delay and there was no indication that counsel had any further adverse incident with defendant subsequent to one threat. The record supported the finding that defendant posed a substantial security risk for the courtroom and that the use of restraints was warranted. The evidence was sufficient that the murder was premeditated in that the victim was unarmed, it was indicated that she was asleep in her bed, and defendant had stated his intentions to get rid of her. Further, evidence of the first murder and burglary was properly introduced to show motive and premeditation, and the trial court properly instructed the jury on that issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-1003 was unconstitutional because the term &quot;possess&quot; was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court of appeals disagreed. It was apparent that accidental possession of the prohibited materials was not enough to satisfy the State's burden of knowing possession. Indeed, one who received an unsolicited email or advertisement that contained child pornography had not overtly acted at all, much less knowingly. Similarly, one who accidentally opened a disguised email or inadvertently visited a web page containing child pornography could not be said to have acted with awareness that he or she was taking knowing possession of prohibited material. Although defendant claimed that citizens could &quot;inadvertently, but knowingly possess prohibited images on their computers,&quot; that argument was oxymoronic and attempted to expand the scope of the statute beyond that which was established by the plain meaning of its terms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a second pro se petition for habeas corpus relief, in which he contended that he was entitled to habeas corpus relief because he was deprived of the right to a jury trial and his indictment was insufficient. The Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) issued an order dismissing the petition, finding that, inter alia, petitioner failed to adhere to the mandatory requirements for habeas corpus relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner failed to adhere to the mandatory requirements for habeas corpus petitions under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-21-107. He falsely stated that the instant petition was his first petition for writ of habeas corpus on the instant case, when he had previously filed a habeas corpus petition in the same case and in the same court. Petitioner failed to attach his previous petition and the order denying it, and he failed to give satisfactory reasons for failing to comply with the mandates of &sect; 29-21-107. Further, he alleged that his indictment was insufficient, but he failed to attach his indictment to his petition for the trial court's review. However, even if petitioner had complied with the statutory requirements, he would not be entitled to relief. Petitioner's first claim was that his sentence for his conviction for conspiracy to sell over 300 grams of cocaine was unconstitutional in light of Blakely v. Washington. Petitioner's claim regarding his sentence based on Blakely was not a cognizable claim for habeas corpus relief. Petitioner failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that his conviction was void or his term of imprisonment had expired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Circuit Court for Warren County (Tennessee) found defendant guilty of failure to display a driver's license; resisting arrest; and simple possession of a Schedule III controlled substance. The trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent terms for an effective sentence of 11 months and 29 days. The trial court suspended all but 120 days of defendant's effective sentence, and placed defendant on probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was necessary to show a police officer both the front and the back of the driver's license in order to comply with the display requirements set forth in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-50-351(a). Because defendant did not allow the officer to look at the back of his license, he failed to comply with &sect; 55-50-351(a). Thus, defendant was lawfully arrested for failure to display his driver's license. Accordingly, the drugs found in defendant's vehicle were discovered during a lawful search incident to his arrest. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the drugs found in his truck during a search incident to his arrest. In addition, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for resisting arrest, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-602, because (1) after defendant refused to show the officer his license, the officer asked defendant to exit his vehicle, but he refused; (2) the officer called for back up, but he still refused exit his vehicle; (3) the officer then placed him under arrest; (4) the officer had to forcibly pull him from the vehicle; and (5) defendant continued to struggle on the ground as the officers attempted to handcuff him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Blount County (Tennessee), which convicted defendant of first degree premeditated murder with one aggravating circumstance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A boyfriend offered money to kill the victim, who allegedly raped his girlfriend. Defendant, the boyfriend, and others went to the victim's residence and shot him. The court held among other things: (1) a jury could infer that after proclaiming he needed the reward money and obtaining a gun, defendant went to the victim's house and shot him; (2) although defendant was tried by a Caucasian jury, he failed to show that if the representation of African Americans was underrepresented in the petit jury, it was the result of systematic exclusion; (3) the decision to admit an excited utterance during testimony could not be impugned by testimony of the hearsay declarant that was not presented until later; (4) the trial court erred in failing to require defense counsel to conduct an inquiry into defendant's right to testify under the Momon guidelines; (5) the circumstances included none of the exacerbating indicia that justified the death penalty in other gunshot-inflicted homicides as the application of the Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i)(2) (2003) factor was based upon a single prior conviction, aggravated robbery and defendant's role in the homicide, though major, may have been vicarious.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence that the State was delaying prosecution of defendant to gain a tactical advantage or to harass him. The delays did not occur because of bureaucratic indifference. Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal which also delayed his trial. Defendant was aware of the charges against him and he did not mitigate the effect of the delay in his failure to raise the issue earlier in the proceedings. The trial court found that there was no prejudice to defendant since he could have taken the deposition of a few of the witnesses in question. In addition, defendant did not subpoena another witness, and the trial court questioned the witness's unavailability.</SPAN></P>

The rule against hearsay would have prevented defendant from asking the victim about the alleged rapist's daughter's statement. Because the victim testified at the proffer that she did not make a false allegation of rape, Tenn. R. Evid. 608 would have operated to prevent defendant from calling the alleged rapist or his daughter to contradict the victim's denial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, petitioner argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately investigate the facts and prepare for trial, failing to effectively raise the defense of consent, and denying him the opportunity to testify on his own behalf at trial by telling him that he would be &quot;stupid&quot; if he chose to testify. The appellate court held that petitioner was afforded the effective assistance of counsel. Petitioner conceded in his brief that, given the largely unrebutted testimony provided at the post-conviction hearing regarding counsel's fact investigation, it could not honestly be argued that those activities amounted to ineffective representation. Additionally, the transcript of the trial revealed that trial counsel raised the issue of consent on at least two occasions. Finally, trial counsel admitted to the statement regarding petitioner's testimony but stated that she left the ultimate decision about the testimony to petitioner, and petitioner admitted on cross-examination that he had the ultimate choice on whether he would testify and that he voluntarily chose not to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to the attempted rape of his girlfriend's daughter, and was sentenced to six years in prison. On appeal of the district court's judgment denying defendant's petition for post-conviction relief, the court held that several issues defendant raised were not properly before the court because he failed to cite to the record or to authorities, as required by Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 10(b) and Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7). The following issues were not subject to post-conviction relief under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-103: (1) that the available evidence would prove defendant's factual and actual innocence; (2) that he was subjected to an unlawful arrest; (3) that defendant was not given immediate access to evidence; and (4) that he was denied the effective assistance of post-conviction counsel. Defendant waived his claim that he was denied due process because of an unconstitutional and illegal conspiracy by the prosecution, the judge, and both defense attorneys to convict, sentence, and imprison him because he failed to raise the claim in his post-conviction petition. Defendant also waived three claims by failing to provide a complete record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, revoked defendant's probation after it was alleged that defendant violated probation by possessing cocaine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the cocaine was illegally seized and the evidence should have been suppressed. The appellate court noted that the record was void of any evidence of reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, such that defendant's detention constituted a de facto arrest. The search and seizure of the cocaine was unreasonable as no Miranda warnings were provided to defendant, consent immediately followed the illegal seizure, and no intervening event occurred. However, exclusion of evidence in a revocation hearing that was obtained as a result of police harassment or obtained in a particularly offensive manner was consistent with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-311(d) which permitted the trial judge to enter judgment as the trial judge may deem right and proper under the evidence presented. The officer was not informed that defendant was a probationer, only that he had prior convictions. In the absence of any evidence of police harassment or that the evidence was obtained in a particularly offensive manner, the exclusionary rule was not applicable.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. At the conclusion of the expert's testimony, the postconviction court questioned the expert about his motives for changing careers from teaching at a university to becoming a mitigation specialist and sentencing consultant. The petitioner argued that, by questioning the witness at length, taking notes during his testimony and &quot;smiling&quot; at the prosecutor during the testimony, the postconviction judge created the appearance that he was taking sides. However, the judge presided over the postconviction hearing, without a jury, and while expressing those sentiments before a jury might have given rise to concern that the trial judge's statements or actions prejudiced the finder of fact, that concern was not present where the trial judge was the trier of fact. Therefore, it was not error for the postconviction judge to fail to recuse himself for questioning the expert.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was a minor at the time of the offense. He contended that the juvenile court was required by law to find reasonable grounds at a transfer hearing before transferring him to criminal court. Defendant asserted that the only finding in the transfer order was the judge's notation &quot;Waived by the Defendant.&quot; He further argued that his sentence was illegal because the trial court applied enhancement factors based upon facts not found by a jury or admitted by him. The appellate court held that transfer order was properly signed and dated; therefore, the trial court had authority and jurisdiction to convict and sentence defendant. The appellate court further held that the claimed defect, even if true, did not constitute a jurisdictional defect; thus, defendant presented a voidable claim, which was not cognizable in a petition for writ of habeas corpus. The appellate court concluded that defendant's reliance on Blakely and his accompanying argument failed in many respects, and that where the allegations in a petition for writ of habeas corpus did not demonstrate that the judgment was void, a trial court could correctly dismiss the petition without a hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that he was improperly classified as a habitual offender because he lacked the requisite number of necessary felony convictions, that his underlying convictions included illegally-imposed concurrent sentences, and that the habeas corpus court improperly refused to appoint counsel in his case or hold an evidentiary hearing on the issues raised in his petition. With respect to the propriety of the inmate's habitual offender classification, the instant court concluded that the law of the case doctrine barred its reconsideration of the issue. With respect to the legality of the underlying convictions supporting the inmate's habitual offender classification, the instant court concluded that the inmate could not use the writ of habeas corpus to attack his predicate convictions because the sentences on those convictions had been served and had expired. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-21-101 (2000), for the inmate to be eligible for habeas corpus relief, it was necessary that he be imprisoned or restrained of liberty. The inmate could not attack these convictions because he was no longer imprisoned or restrained of his liberty in consequence of them.</SPAN></P>

Consenting adults had a right to privacy that extended to entitled them, in certain circumstances, to engage in sexual activity in the privacy of their home, there was no such entitlement to do so in a public place.

The trial court found that the video was relevant to show the position of the victims, to give an accurate description of the crime scene, to corroborate testimony, to show the location of the victims' hats, to show the location of the shell casings, and to show intent. The trial court further found that the probative value of the videotape was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The crime scene video of most homicides necessarily depicted the bodies of the victims as they were found and the blood of the victims. If the court of appeals were to accept defendant's argument in that regard, no crime scene videotapes of murders would ever be admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the Criminal Court for Knox County (Tennessee) with four counts of murder. The State appealed the trial court's grant of defendant's motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court properly suppressed his statements because the investigating officers did not &quot;scrupulously honor&quot; his invocation of his right to remain silent. The court of appeals agreed. Despite two invocations of the right to counsel, investigators continued to approach defendant and either interrogate him directly or attempt to endear themselves to him in hopes that he would discuss the investigations. The record reflected that an officer spoke to a jailmate of defendant and asked whether defendant discussed with him about what the detectives had talked to defendant on November 4 and 5. It was simply unreasonable to conclude that the officer was not referring to substantive conversations he and the other detectives had with defendant on November 4 and 5. Therefore, after the defendant invoked his right to remain silent, the detectives re-questioned him at least three additional times and met with him on two other occasions where, at the least, the conversations concerned the same subject matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Tennessee) convicted petitioner inmate, upon his guilty plea, of one count of selling over .5 grams of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school, a Class A felony. He agreed to be sentenced as a Range I offender to 15 years. The inmate subsequently filed for post-conviction relief raising challenges to his indictment, conviction, and sentence. After a hearing, the trial court denied relief. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the inmate was not entitled to relief on the basis of his allegations concerning the post-conviction trial judge. Also, the inmate claimed that his sentence was illegal because it was outside the Range I sentence for a Class B felony. However, the inmate pled guilty to selling over .5 grams of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school. The sale of over .5 grams of cocaine was normally a Class B felony, but, because the sale was made within 1,000 feet of a school, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-432(b), the inmate's offense was punishable by one classification higher than was provided in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-417(b)-(i). Accordingly, the inmate was subject to being sentenced for a Class A felony. The inmate knew that he was pleading guilty to a Class A felony at his guilty plea hearing. The Range I sentence for a Class A felony was 15 to 25 years. Thus, the inmate's 15-year sentence was not illegal. Additionally, the appellate court found that because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-432 did not create an offense, it could not contain any lesser offenses. Thus, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-417 was not a lesser-included offense of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-432.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that defendant intelligently and voluntarily consented to a search, even though he was aware of his right to refuse. In light of the substantial interests of the State, the diminished privacy interests of convicted felons, and the minimal intrusion caused by the taking of blood samples, the collection and maintenance of DNA samples pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-321, was reasonable. The evidence was sufficient to support the finding that defendant was the person who committed the crimes where the DNA profile from the victim's rape kit matched defendant's DNA profile and an expert witness concluded that no other person could have been the source of the semen. The trial court properly gave great weight to defendant's previous history of criminal convictions, and properly considered the enhancement factor that defendant had a previous history of unwillingness to comply with the conditions of his release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police executed a search warrant and discovered numerous items at the residence that were associated with the manufacture of methamphetamine.

The evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction for facilitation of the manufacture of methamphetamine. Defendant's objection to the prosecutor's statements about inferences that the jury could draw was waived by his failure object at trial pursuant to Tenn. R. App. P. 36(a). The prosecutor's reference to the general problem of the manufacture of methamphetamine did not warrant reversal. The judgment form contained clerical errors that required correction. Defendant's claim that the facilitation statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-11-403, was vague was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

During the first robbery, she feared that defendant would rape or kill her. The victim quickly complied with all of defendant's orders during the second robbery, including opening the safe and giving him the security system video tape. When the police called and told her to leave the phone off the hook she did not, testifying that she &quot;couldn't&quot; because she was afraid defendant would become suspicious. When defendant forced her into the restroom she remained inside until she was informed the police had defendant in custody.

Also, the petitioner's sentence was not facially void. The petitioner pled guilty to robbery, a class C felony, and received a sentence of eight years, which was certainly within the appropriate range. Furthermore, the petitioner was sufficiently notified of the charges against him, and the trial court had authority to enter the judgment following his plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his petition, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 in light of Blakely, and argued that because the enhancement factors used to increase his sentence were not included in the indictment, his indictment failed to allege the necessary facts to constitute the offense with which he was charged. The appellate court initially noted that although defendant's pre se notice of appeal was not filed within the 30-day time period of Tenn. R. App. P. 4, it would waive the timely filing of the notice of appeal in the interest of justice to address the issues on the merits. The appellate court held that the state supreme court recently determined that Blakely did not announce a new rule of law and that the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 did not authorize a sentencing procedure which violated the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial. The appellate court further held that while if the indictment charging defendant were fatally defective, the issue could have been raised in a habeas corpus petition; however, he failed to include his indictments with his petition; thus, he was not entitled to relief on the issue.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that his convictions or sentences were void.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant one filed an interlocutory appeal from the Criminal Court for Knox County, Tennessee, which denied his motion to dismiss a child pornography possession case under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-1003 and determined that only a portion of the statute was unconstitutional. The State appealed the orders in cases against defendant one and defendant two for the State to produce the alleged pornographic material.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant two was charged under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-1004. The trial court ordered the State under Tenn. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(C) (2004) to copy evidence in defendant one's case, and provide a mirror image of defendant two's hard drive. The court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-1003(b), by allowing a jury to infer that a participant is a minor if the material represented or depicted the participant as a minor came too close to permitting a conviction when an actual minor was not involved. However, the rest of the statute, severed from subsection (b), did not proscribe the possession of &quot;virtual&quot; child pornography or material containing youthful-looking adults. As to the risk that someone who received an unsolicited email could be charged, the expert testified that it was possible to distinguish a file that had been accidentally placed on a hard drive. Therefore, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court further held that the copying of the pornographic materials did not violate the sexual exploitation of a minor statutes in the context of the prosecution or defendant of a case under the statute and the motions to compel were properly granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction challenged in this appeal stemmed from an automobile chase through the streets of central Nashville, Tennessee.

II, &sect; 7; there was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's conviction; (3) there was sufficient proof of risk of injury or death to convict defendant of Class D felony evading arrest; the defendant was not denied his right to effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to request jury instructions on a lesser-included offense and failed to challenge the unlawfulness of the attempted arrest; and the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury was not violated when the trial court made findings of fact for &quot;sentence enhancing purposes.&quot; However, the trial court erred in sentencing him as a career offender, because the State's notice of intent to seek enhanced punishment was defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Blount County (Tennessee) convicted defendant of violating the Habitual Motor Vehicle Offenders Act, felony evading arrest with risk of death, and felony reckless endangerment. The trial court ordered him to serve the six-year sentences for violation of the Act and reckless endangerment concurrently. The trial court ordered that those sentences be served consecutively to the 12 year sentence for evading arrest. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence was sufficient to convict defendant because (1) the first officer began to pursue a speeding vehicle, which sped up to an estimated speed of 100 miles per hour; (2) a second officer saw the driver briefly as he jumped out of the vehicle, but before the driver ran away from the vehicle; (3) the second officer recognized the individual as defendant; (4) the passenger said that defendant had been driving the car and that she had begged him to stop the car; and (5) a third officer, who was off duty and was sitting on his great aunt's porch about 20 feet from the vehicle, saw defendant jump out of the driver's side of the car. Also, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for Class D felony evading arrest as he was driving at an estimated speed of 100 miles an hour, there were other cars on the road, and there were several people outside and cars lining both sides of the street where he stopped. However, defendant's convictions for Class E felony reckless endangerment and Class D felony evading arrest violated his rights against double jeopardy. Therefore, the reckless endangerment conviction was merged into the conviction for felony evading arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of one count of manufacturing methamphetamine and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia. The Circuit Court for Henry County (Tennessee) imposed a split sentence for the manufacturing conviction, with one year to be served and the remainder to be served on supervised probation, to run concurrently with a sentence of 11 months and 29 days for the possession charge. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the initial stop of his vehicle was invalid due to lack of probable cause and, even if valid, the subsequent search was illegal. The appellate court concluded that the officer had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle based on information that defendant had been observed buying large quantities of Sudafed or similar cold remedies, commonly known to be used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. In addition, the officer did not exceed the permissive scope of defendant's consent to look into his vehicle. Next, the appellate court found no merit in defendant's claim that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence three cans of starting fluid because the State failed to establish a proper chain of custody. Finally, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his manufacturing conviction. The appellate court agreed, noting that there was no proof that suggested that defendant was propagating any controlled substances. He did, however, have many of the precursors to manufacturing and thus, the State had a submissible case of attempted manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction for manufacturing methamphetamine was reversed and dismissed, and the case was remanded for trial for attempted manufacturing of methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged a judgment of the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) that dismissed his request for post-conviction relief for failure to state a claim within the purview of the Post-Conviction Relief Act, which had not been waived or previously determined as provided in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-106(f) (2004). Petitioner was seeking relief from his conviction of premeditated first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought post-conviction relief alleging that evidence was obtained as the result of an illegal search; that the State failed to disclose exculpatory evidence; that he received ineffective assistance of counsel; that newly discovered evidence would exonerate him; and that the grand and petit juries were improperly selected. Petitioner's attorney had filed a motion for withdrawal based on difficulties representing petitioner. Before denying counsel's motion to withdraw, the lower court dismissed the petition, noting that each claim was either waived or had been previously determined. On review, the court held that the lower court properly dismissed the petition without an evidentiary hearing and that the delay in the disposition of the petition did not prejudice petitioner, thus, any error would have been harmless. The court held that the lower court was well within its authority to consider the petition prior to ruling on counsel's motion to withdraw. The court noted that the lower court did file its order more than 30 days after the filing of the amended petition as specified in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-106(a) but that &sect; 40-30-106 was only directory and not mandatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court judgment that denied post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

In his statements to police, defendant admitted to killing the victim, hiding her body in a field under pieces of tin, and fleeing in her vehicle. Defendant also admitted that at the time of the carjacking, he had two guns concealed in his boots. Defendant subsequently directed officers to the location of the victim's body. The victim died as a result of a stab wound to the back. The blade of the knife broke off in the victim's chest cavity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of obtaining a prescription drug by fraud and his post-conviction motion was denied. On appeal, the court reversed that denial, holding that his counsel was ineffective at trial and on appeal for failing to request a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of facilitation and for failing to appeal the jury instruction issue. Thus, the court reversed the dismissal of the petition, reversed the original conviction, and remanded for a new trial. It appeared that counsel was trying to prove that the inmate was merely a facilitator of the felony and that he lacked the intent requested to commit the crime with which he was charged. Yet counsel did not request that the trial court give the jury a facilitation instruction, or object to the instructions given. The court could find no reasonable explanation for counsel's failure to raise the issue on direct appeal. His sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment considering his prior criminal convictions and his historically unsuccessful attempts at parole, probation, and rehabilitation. Thus, the sentence was not &quot;grossly disproportionate&quot; to his offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury as to any lesser included offenses of identity theft and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Defendant conceded that he used his father's identity, but argued that the record did not contain any proof that he intended to commit any unlawful activity. The appellate court found that there was proof that defendant signed his father's name on the citation, which specified a court date. Defendant's father testified that he received a letter from the city court, stating that he had failed to appear for a court date. The evidence supported the inference that defendant used his father's identity in order to avoid a court appearance. None of defendant's proposed lesser included offenses were lesser included offenses of identity theft. Misdemeanor theft, fraudulent use of a driver license, and criminal impersonation were not lesser included offenses of identity theft under the guidelines set forth in a prior case.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner claimed he received ineffective assistance of counsel during trial and the penalty phase, and that the heinous, atrocious or cruel aggravating circumstance under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(5) and the death penalty were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found that petitioner's murder of his wife was especially heinous, atrocious and cruel. Petitioner had cut the phone lines before forcing his way into his wife's home, inflicted many injuries while his children pleaded for him to stop, and then dragged his wife outside where he strangled and drowned her in the pool. The court affirmed the dismissal of the petition for post-conviction relief. The court held that the record did not support petitioner's claims that his counsel failed to present a proper intoxication defense or mitigation defense during the penalty phase. The court found that defense counsel relied upon a theory that petitioner acted in an impulsive rather than a premeditated manner and attempted to convince the jury that he was distraught, depressed, and intoxicated when he went to his wife's home attempting a reconciliation. The court also found that evidence was elicited that showed petitioner had a habit of disconnecting phone lines without any resulting harm. The court rejected petitioner's constitutional challenges to the death penalty and the aggravating factor on the ground they had been previously determined, waived, or not supported with evidence.</SPAN></P>

The death penalty imposed did not violate due process, even though the indictment did not allege the aggravators relied upon by the State.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of especially aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor and false imprisonment in the Criminal Court for Davidson County, Tennessee. His convictions and sentences were affirmed on appeal. He filed a petition to rehear based on the United States Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v. Washington, and the trial court's consideration of enhancement factors at sentencing. The instant court granted review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In light of Blakely, defendant argued that the trial court violated his right to trial by jury guaranteed to him by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when it enhanced his sentence as to the aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor offense, at least in part, by finding facts not submitted to the jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court noted that Blakely made it clear that a trial court could enhance a sentence based upon prior convictions. Thus, the trial court's application of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-114(2) for defendant's prior convictions was proper. However, the trial court also applied enhancement factors under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-114(8) and (16). Respectively, factors (8) and (16) provided that the offense involved a victim and was committed to gratify defendant's desire for pleasure or excitement, and defendant abused a position of public or private trust. The appellate court held the trial court's application of those factors violated Blakely. Consequently, the appellate court modified defendant's sentence for especially aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor from 11 years to nine years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The previous opinion of the instant court affirming defendant's sentence was vacated. Defendant's sentence for the conviction of especially aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor was modified. The remainder of the instant court's previous opinion affirming defendant's convictions was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised several issues. The appellate court held that: (1) the trial court did not err by failing to suppress an in-court identification, as there was no State action in arranging the courtroom &quot;confrontation&quot; between the witness and defendant and defendant was permitted to cross-examine the witness; (2) the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions despite defendant's argument that the proof was insufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the person who committed the crimes. The identification testimony of a witness was properly admitted into evidence and there was testimony from three other witnesses regarding a distinctive way defendant held a pen. The evidence, considered in the light most favorable to the State, was more than sufficient to support the convictions; (3) the trial court failed to impose a sentence in accordance with sentencing guidelines; and (4) as the record was silent regarding any finding of defendant's ability to pay the ordered restitution during his period of probation and this was a required finding, the trial court erred in determining the amount of restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal Court for White County (Tennessee) convicted defendant of two counts of rape of a child, a Class A felony, and two counts of aggravated sexual battery, a Class B felony, and sentenced him to concurrent sentences of 25 years for each rape conviction and 12 years for each aggravated sexual battery conviction.  Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had sexual intercourse with his girlfriend's 12-year-old daughter. He claimed the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions, arguing the victim's testimony was not credible. However, credibility was determined by the jury. The evidence was sufficient. Because no evidence existed to show that he formed the intent to penetrate the victim only after he touched her, his separate convictions for a bathroom incident violated double jeopardy, and his aggravated sexual battery conviction merged into his rape of a child conviction. Rape of a child required unlawful sexual penetration. The victim testified defendant penetrated her vagina twice with his penis. As there was no evidence that defendant only attempted to penetrate the victim, the trial court was not required to instruct on attempted child rape. Because aggravated sexual battery, child abuse, and Class B misdemeanor assault were lesser included offenses of child rape, the trial court erred by failing to instruct on those lesser included offenses, which was harmless error. The trial court improperly applied enhancement factors under Blakely, so defendant's sentences were reduced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rape of a child convictions were affirmed. The aggravated sexual battery convictions violated double jeopardy and merged into the convictions for rape of a child. The case was remanded for modifying the judgments to reflect that the aggravated sexual battery convictions merged into the rape of a child convictions. Each of defendant's sentences for rape of a child was modified from 25 to 23 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal Court for Knox County (Tennessee) of, inter alia, aggravated burglary and felony. The burglary conviction was affirmed on direct appeal but the case was remanded for retrial on the felony murder count. Prior to his second trial, the trial court applied the law of the case doctrine to prevent defendant from contesting his conviction for aggravated burglary. Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court's order impinged on his rights to a jury trial and to present evidence in his defense. The court of appeals agreed. Defendant's constitutional right to a jury trial would be violated by the trial court's order which prevented him from presenting proof which would question the burglary conviction. Thus, just as he could not be collaterally estopped, for constitutional reasons, from presenting proof as to the burglary conviction, he, likewise, could not be barred, by application of the law of the case, from doing so. Of course, evidence presented in that regard must meet the admissibility requirements of the Tennessee Rules of Evidence. Although defendant suggested in his appellate brief that Tennessee law might allow the trial court to instruct the jury as to the existence of the burglary judgment at the end of the trial, that possible procedure was not briefed by the parties and, therefore, was not before the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty in the Circuit Court for Rutherford County, Tennessee, to violating the Tennessee Motor Vehicle Habitual Offender Act (Act), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-601 (1998 &amp; Supp. 2003), et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that since the Act provided for a three-year time period that a defendant was prohibited from driving and, as such, a defendant could not be in violation of the Act when driving more than three years after the entry of a judgment declaring him a habitual offender. The State responded that, by the language of the statute, any person found to be a habitual offender who thereafter was convicted of operating a motor vehicle in Tennessee while the judgment or order of the court prohibiting such operation was in effect committed a class E felony. The appellate court held that the legislature's articulation of a three-year time period in the Act did not bar prosecution of a defendant, who was apprehended for driving in violation of an order declaring him an habitual offender, even though he was driving more than three years after the entry of the order declaring him an habitual offender. The appellate court concluded that a defendant could not, by merely failing to file a petition, circumvent the requirement that the trial court restore his driving privileges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Lauderdale County (Tennessee), which denied his petition for habeas corpus relief on the ground that he failed to attach the judgment or record of the proceedings upon which the judgment was rendered. The State filed a motion requesting that the court affirm the trial court's denial of relief, pursuant to Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the attachment of a photocopy of the judgment form to defendant's motion to reconsider the trial court's denial of his petition failed to cure the deficiency in his actual petition. In granting the State's motion, the court found that the inmate had failed to attach the applicable judgments of conviction that he claimed were void to his petition. The procedural provisions of the habeas corpus statutes, particularly Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;29-21-107, were mandatory and had to be followed scrupulously. Moreover, even assuming that the attachment of the judgment form to the motion to reconsider perfected the procedural requirements of the petition, the court held that the inmate had still failed to establish grounds for which the writ would issue because he failed to establish that his sentence had expired or that his sentences were illegal. The question of whether the Tennessee Department of Correction was properly calculating the inmate's sentence could not be raised in a habeas corpus proceeding. To challenge such calculations, the inmate had to proceed under the Tennessee Uniform Administrative Procedures Act in chancery court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The White County Criminal Court, Tennessee, convicted defendant of two counts of rape of a child and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. He was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 25 years for each rape conviction and 12 years for each aggravated sexual battery conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified that defendant came into the bathroom on her 12th birthday, touched her breasts and genital area, and put his penis in her vagina. A few months later, defendant again touched her private parts and had sexual intercourse with her. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions for two counts of child rape. His convictions for aggravated sexual battery were merged into the child rape convictions. By failing to make a hearsay objection at trial, defendant waived any error in an expert's testimony that the victim stated that defendant had sex with her on several occasions. The trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of child rape was harmless error. The trial court was not required to instruct the jury on attempted child rape. The jury instructions did not lessen the State's burden of proof. The trial court improperly enhanced defendant's sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's child rape convictions were affirmed, and his convictions for aggravated sexual battery were merged into the child rape convictions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a fourth pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Circuit Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, alleging that the statutes under which he received a life sentence were unconstitutional. The trial court summarily dismissed the petition without a hearing. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his petition, the inmate argued that the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1982 and the habitual criminal statute under which he was sentenced to life imprisonment were unconstitutional as applied to him, as they violated his right to equal protection. The appellate court initially noted that habeas corpus relief would only be granted when it appeared upon the face of the judgment or the record of the proceedings upon which the judgment was rendered that a trial court lacked jurisdiction or authority to sentence a defendant or that the sentence had expired. The appellate court held that the habitual criminal statute did not violate the due process or equal protection provisions of the state or federal constitutions, nor did its imposition result in cruel and unusual punishment. Moreover, the appellate court concluded that the fact that the habitual criminal statute allowed prosecutorial selectivity in its applications created no constitutional infringement; therefore, the trial court committed no error in summarily dismissing the inmate's petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed a decision of the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief that alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, improper jury instructions, double jeopardy violations, and the sentence. The inmate was convicted of two counts of rape, one count of attempted rape, and he pled nolo contendere a reduction to sexual battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate signed and dated his original petition more than two months after the expiration of the one-year period of the date of the appellate decision and so consideration was barred under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(a) (2003), but the court addressed the issues raised. The inmate alleged that counsel failed to subpoena the rape victim's alleged boyfriend as a witness to rebut the false testimony given in the presence of the jury by the alleged rape victim. The court held that because the witness was not produced at the evidentiary hearing, the inmate failed to show that he was prejudiced by counsel's not producing the witness at trial. As to the inmate's claim that Brady materials were not produced by the State, the inmate failed to explain in his petition or at the post-conviction hearing why the issue was not raised on direct appeal as required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-106(g) (2003). Also, the Department of Corrections had no discretion regarding the inmate's sentence applying Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-523(b) and so did not err by classifying the inmate as a &quot;multiple rapist.&quot; The court held that other claims were waived because they were not raised at the evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee) of first-degree felony murder, first-degree premeditated murder, conspiracies to commit both modes of first-degree murder, especially aggravated burglary, especially aggravated robbery, three counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, and three counts of aggravated assault.  Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress his inculpatory statement. The court of appeals disagreed. The record supported the denial of the motion to suppress. An officer detailed an orderly process in which the officers advised defendant of his Miranda rights, procured a written waiver of his rights, obtained an informal statement, and procured defendant's adoption of a formal transcript of the statement. The officer's testimony that defendant waived his Miranda rights was not factually challenged. Thus, the State carried its burden of demonstrating that the high-school-educated defendant voluntarily and understandingly waived his rights. Furthermore, the officer affirmatively contradicted defendant's claim that his will to remain silent had been overborne by promises of leniency, physical discomfort, and threats that defendant's sister would lose her job unless the defendant confessed, and defendant's left hand was not handcuffed during the interview.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for conspiracy to commit first-degree felony murder was reversed. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Sullivan County (Tennessee) imposed on petitioner inmate an effective term of 12 years' imprisonment, including two, concurrent six-year sentences and a third, consecutive, six-year sentence for the convictions of driving in violation of the motor vehicle habitual offender order. The inmate filed a motion to correct the illegal sentence. The trial court denied the inmate's motion. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted pursuant to guilty pleas of three counts of violating the Tennessee Motor Vehicle Habitual Offenders Act. The inmate filed a motion to vacate or to correct his allegedly illegal sentences. The inmate asserted that the sentences imposed upon his convictions for driving in violation of the motor vehicle habitual offenders act were illegal, because the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. In particular, the inmate asserted that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-616 failed to specify the punishment to be imposed for its violation. The trial court denied the motion, finding that the habitual traffic offender statutes were constitutional and legally correct. In the present case, the judgments reflected that, consistent with the applicable sentencing statutes, the inmate was sentenced as a career offender to a maximum Range III sentence of six years in prison for each conviction of driving in violation of a motor vehicle habitual offender order. Upon due consideration of the record, pleadings, and applicable law, the appellate court concluded that the trial court properly denied the inmate's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee), after he was convicted by a jury of second degree murder. Defendant was subsequently sentenced as a Range II offender to 38 years in the Tennessee Department of Correction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from an incident where he beat the victim to death as part of a group of four men. The appellate court generally held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction, as defendant hit the victim in the head repeatedly with a &quot;plank&quot; while others were doing likewise, such conduct was reasonably certain to cause death, and defendant was aware of his own actions. However, the trial court committed reversible error in failing to charge the jury on the lesser-included offense of facilitation of second degree murder, as defendant's failure to request the instruction did not waive his right to have the jury so instructed, and evidence existed that reasonable minds could accept as to facilitation of second degree murder because there was no proof establishing which of the four men struck the fatal blow(s). Additionally, the waiver provision of Tenn. Const. Ann. &sect; 40-18-110(c) was constitutionally infirm as violative of a criminal defendant's fundamental constitutional right to have the jury charged on all lesser-included offenses embraced by the indictment and supported by the proof adduced at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the matter to the trial court for a new trial. If further appellate review upheld defendant's conviction, the matter had to nonetheless be remanded for a determination of whether defendant personally waived his right to testify and, if not, whether that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-504 (2004) and imposed an 10-year prison sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because there was no evidence of a specific incident or testimony as to the date of any particular offense. The court held that in cases where a defendant committed multiple offenses against the victim, the election doctrine only required the State to select which of multiple offenses in evidence it relied upon to seek the conviction. The court found that the State told the jury during closing arguments that it was electing a specific incident, that the victim testified about the particular details of that incident, and that references to other incidents were in very general terms, thus the jury must have relied on the specific incident in reaching its verdict. The court also held that the mid-range sentence imposed was clearly justified despite the trial court's failure to consider defendant's favorable sex offender evaluation for sentencing mitigation because the weight given to each enhancement or mitigating factor was within the discretion of the trial court. The court concluded that the failure to instruct the jury on the offense of child abuse was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court directed that on remand the instant court reconsider its previous conclusion that the trial court charged the incorrect version of the aggravating circumstance in Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i)(5) (1982). Inter alia, the court held that the trial court utilized the correct version of this statute when instructing the jury at the resentencing hearing as to aggravating circumstances. Trial counsel acknowledged that he knew a person, whom petitioner claimed committed the murder, was at the motel to rent a room with his paramour, but did not cross-examine him on this fact, as the sheriff did not want that person to be embarrassed and had assured trial counsel that the person knew nothing about the murder. Petitioner claimed that this was an actual conflict of interest and thus, there was a presumption of prejudice. The instant court held that trial counsel's failure to question the person regarding why he was at the motel did not result in counsel representing the sheriff's interests so there was no actual conflict. Moreover, petitioner would not have created residual doubt by arguing that the person he sought to have questioned had killed the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved the murder and rape of a 13-year-old girl, defendant's stepdaughter. Defendant raised numerous issues on appeal. The appellate court generally held that: (1) the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction, as defendant took police into the woods and led them to the location where the victim's body was found, and he was able to re-enact how the murder took place and able to describe how the victim was stabbed; (2) the trial court's improper restriction on defendant's cross-examination of a witness was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the witness was not the only witness testifying to the incriminating facts against defendant, and most of his testimony was corroborated by other witnesses; (3) there were no jury instruction errors; (4) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering defendant to sit in the front row behind defense counsel's table; and (5) defendant's sentence of death was not disproportionate considering the circumstances of the crime and defendant, as the case, taken as a whole, was not plainly lacking in circumstances consistent with other similar cases in which the death penalty had been imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Tennessee), which convicted him of first degree premeditated murder, especially aggravated kidnapping, rape of a child, and two counts of criminal impersonation. The jury found that the proof supported four aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(1), (2), (6), and (7) and sentenced defendant to death for the murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five days before the victim's disappearance, defendant introduced himself to the nine-year-old victim as a police officer and offered to take her swimming and to shoot fireworks. Defendant returned to the victim's residence shortly before her disappearance. He admitted that she entered his car but claimed hat he accidentally backed over her and that he took her body and threw it over a bridge. The victim's remains were found months later in the woods. Her T-shirt was found inside-out nearby, and her shorts had semen stains on them. Defendant's wife testified that when he returned home the day of the victim's disappearance, blood was on his shirt, his pants and the car were muddy, and a child's fingerprints could be seen on the passenger side of the car's windshield. The court held that there was sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could have concluded that defendant kidnapped the victim near her home, drove her to a remote area, and killed her with premeditation and in the perpetration of the kidnapping. Although the rape was based on circumstantial evidence, sufficient evidence existed that defendant raped the victim and murdered her in the perpetration of the rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, petitioner argued that his trial counsel was ineffective by: (1) failing to conduct an adequate investigation of his statement, admitting that had been engaging in sexual intercourse with the victim; (2) failing to file a motion to suppress the statement; (3) failing to challenge the constitutionality of the incest statute (4) failing to object to the admission of the victim's videotaped statement at the sentencing hearing; and (5) going forward with the sentencing hearing without a psychosexual evaluation. The appellate court held that trial counsel's performance was not deficient because: (1) petitioner had assured counsel that what he told police was true, accurate, voluntary, and not the result of coercion; (2) petitioner had informed counsel that he never would be able to raise the $ 100 needed to pay an examiner for a psychosexual evaluation, and the results of a favorable evaluation would not have changed the outcome of the sentence; (3) the victim's videotaped statement was admissible as reliable hearsay; and (4) petitioner had not demonstrated that the incest statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Detailed records of the prostitution business were found in defendant's apartment. The court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to sever the offenses because the evidence necessary to prove the prostitution and money laundering charges was inextricably linked. The court found that the evidence seized in defendant's apartment was properly admitted as the warrant affidavit was adequately supported by probable cause. The court rejected defendant's hearsay claim as to the evidence because it was admitted only as circumstantial evidence of prostitution activity. The court also held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-13-512 and 39-14-903(b)(1) were not vague or overly broad. The court concluded that the record amply supported the finding that the sentences were to run consecutively where defendant was a professional criminal and continued his business even after being arrested.</SPAN></P>

There was nothing to indicate that the lower court was without jurisdiction to sentence the inmate, nor was there anything to indicate that the inmate's sentences had expired. Thus, no grounds existed that entitled the inmate to habeas corpus relief under Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 or Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-21-101 et seq. The inmate's challenge to the selection process for the foreperson of the grand jury could only be addressed in a petition for post-conviction relief. Considering the inmate's application as one for post-conviction relief under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his premeditated murder conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. A witness testified that he gave dynamite to defendant. Another witness testified that defendant told him that he was having marital problems and that he believed the victim (defendant's wife) was having an affair. The victim's mother testified that she believed the victim was going to leave defendant. While defendant was in jail after the explosion, defendant told an inmate that the victim deserved to die because she was having an affair. Several witnesses at the scene of the explosion testified that the victim was screaming from the pain and was afraid she was going to die. Defendant, unlike the victim, was calm after the explosion and wrapped a cord and a sweater around his arm to control the bleeding. Based on the experts' opinions, the victim's statements after the explosion, and defendant's actions, a jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was upset with the victim because she was having an affair and that he brought the dynamite with him into the car, intending to use the dynamite to kill the victim.</SPAN></P>

Among his many profanity-laced comments were that she &quot;ought to pay&quot; for all she had put him through; that he was &quot;liable to take his son and be gone;&quot; and that he would &quot;take it out on the victim's mother.&quot; Asked by the victim not to hurt their child, defendant replied, &quot;that ain't my kid.&quot; Although the trial court determined that the audiotape of the conversations was admissible pursuant to Tenn. R. Evid. 803, the hearing conducted on the matter substantially complied with the requirements of Tenn. R. Evid. 404(b). The trial court conducted the appropriate jury-out hearing and stated that the probative value of the statements outweighed their prejudicial effect. The trial court explained that the audiotape of defendant's statements was admissible to show the required intent for the offense of attempt to commit first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

The nurse also testified that the victim complained of some discomfort in her private parts and, when the nurse performed the examination, it was very painful for the victim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of three counts of first degree murder, two counts of felony murder, one count of aggravated arson, and one count of conspiracy to commit murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. Given the testimony concerning the injuries to the victims and the cause of the fire, the evidence clearly supported a finding that the killings were premeditated and intentional. The evidence reflected that the fire was intentionally set with the use of accelerants. The pathologist testified that two of the victims were alive at the time the fire was set. That was sufficient to support a finding that aggravated arson was committed. The appellate court concluded that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the findings of guilt. Inter alia, shortly before the murders, defendant threatened to harm one of the victims, even saying &quot;he was going to burn her house down with her in it.&quot; A police officer testified that, when he asked defendant about tools, defendant mentioned the torque wrench and described exactly where investigators found it at the crime scene. However, several witnesses who had been in the house the day before the murders testified that there was no torque wrench in the living room at that time. While not overwhelming, the proof was sufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

P. 37(b)(2), same being whether the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence that was seized as a result of a stop for a traffic violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For unknown reasons, an officer turned his vehicle around to follow defendant.

Defendant gave consent only as to the search of his person, which revealed a bag of cocaine. In his motion to suppress, defendant asserted the officer did not have probable cause to believe that he had committed a crime. Defendant cited precedent for the proposition that the failure to use one's turn signal was not a traffic violation, unless it could have affected other motorists. In fact, defendant was correct that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 55-8-142(a) and 55-8-143(a) did not require a motorist to use a turn signal unless other traffic could be affected by the failure to use a turn signal under the circumstances. However, Clarksville, Tenn., City Ordinance &sect; 9-401, which applied in defendant's case, mandated the use of a turn signal, and its additional requirement did not conflict with State law. Therefore, the officer had probable cause to stop defendant and there was no Fourth Amendment violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) in the Circuit Court for Marshall County, Tennessee. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss his DUI conviction, arguing that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403(n) was unconstitutional because it applied only to certain urban counties. The trial court agreed and held that the statute violated equal protection rights afforded by the United States and Tennessee Constitutions. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403(n) provided, in pertinent part, that in counties with a metropolitan form of government and a population in excess of 100,000, the judge could sentence a person convicted of violating Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-401 for the first time to perform 200 hours of public service work in lieu of the minimum period of confinement. Defendant was convicted in Marshall County, but the latter statute applied to counties such as neighboring Davidson County. On appeal, the State contended that &sect; 55-10-403(n) was constitutional because a rational basis existed for allowing trial courts in counties with populations over 100,000 (here Davidson County) to allow first-time DUI offenders to perform public service instead of serving a mandatory 48 hours in jail. The appellate court, applying its prior ruling in a similar case, State v. Ladonna Kay Lambert, held that, even if &sect; 55-10-403(n) were unconstitutional,&nbsp;&sect; 55-10-403(n) had to be elided from Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403. That left the general DUI sentencing law in effect. Thus, the trial court erred by ruling on the constitutionality of the provision and by holding that the entire statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court dismissing defendant's conviction was reversed, and the matter was remanded for disposition consistent with the appellate court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The judgment also reflected that the 20-year sentence was ordered to run concurrently with a prior, apparently unrelated case in a second county. The record was devoid of any details concerning the case in the second county. The inmate argued that the sentence was void because it was ordered to run concurrent to the prior unrelated offense, in contravention of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-20-111(b). The appellate court ruled that it was unable to ascertain from the record whether the inmate was out on bond on the prior case when any of the other felony offenses were committed. Included in the plea agreement was the provision that all of the sentences would be served concurrently. However, as the trial judge did not hold a hearing on the issue, the appellate court could not resolve it on the record before it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his trial counsel was ineffective because he did not prevent the transfer of defendant to the criminal court from juvenile court. The court of appeals disagreed. Counsel filed a motion contesting the transfer to the criminal court. The juvenile court denied that motion. Counsel testified that his strategy was to establish that defendant was not the shooter, contrary to the contention of the other five defendants. Therefore, he opposed an extensive mental evaluation because he did not want defendant available to the State's psychiatrists. He was afraid that due to defendant's mental history that the State would prove that defendant was a &quot;compulsive psychopath.&quot; Counsel testified that he did not believe there was anything he could do to prevent the transfer to criminal court. Part of the trial counsel's strategy was to prevent the appearance that defendant was a psychopath by not delving into his mental health history. Therefore, the trial counsel did not want an extensive mental evaluation prepared for that phase of the prosecution. That was a reasonable strategy.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The evidence established that defendant traveled to a residence with his accomplices to rob the victims. All three carried weapons. Defendant was an active participant and was the first to fire his weapon during the confrontation, arguably escalating the gravity of the situation. Although robbery was the intended crime, the jury could have inferred that the intended crime became murder when an accomplice shouted at the others to kill one of the victims. Two of the victims, neither of whom were armed, suffered terrible injury as a result of gunshot wounds received in the fray. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions for facilitation of attempted first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The comforter and the quilt were tested in 1995 before the petitioner entered his Alford plea. The testing clearly showed that petitioner's DNA was on the comforter or the quilt. Additional testing proving that someone else's sperm was on the comforter or quilt would not lessen the potential of his guilt when his DNA was found in the original tests. In addition, based upon what petitioner's counsel stated, it was unlikely that additional tests would show that petitioner's sperm was present on the comforter from having sex with his ex-wife. According to what the forensic scientist told petitioner's counsel, it was unlikely that it would show his ex-wife's DNA and even more likely that it would show more of his DNA. Those facts did not lead to a reasonable probability to allow further DNA testing and possible tolling of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant admitted that he and the other defendant took part in the robbery of an armored truck and that the victim was shot in the back of the head during the commission of the robbery. Furthermore, witnesses identified one defendant and testified as to defendants' admissions and their spending of the stolen money. The victim was paralyzed and suffered medical complications. Two-and-a-half years later, the victim died from an infection as a direct result of the gunshot wound. On appeal, the court found that, with regard to the defendant convicted of first-degree murder, the evidence supported the conviction, the sentence of death was not imposed in any arbitrary fashion, and the evidence supported the jury's finding that the aggravating circumstance outweighed mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, the sentence of death was neither excessive nor disproportionate. With regard to the defendant convicted of felony murder, the trial court's failure to properly charge the jury as to the lesser-included offense of facilitation of felony murder was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, that defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury's verdict finding one defendant guilty of first-degree murder and imposing the sentence of death was affirmed. The jury's verdict finding the other defendant guilty of felony murder and imposing the sentence of life without the possibility of parole was vacated, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Counsel's mitigation preparation did not consist solely of interviews with the defendant. Counsel sought family history, but the people interviewed were very &quot;guarded&quot; in providing information about defendant's biological mother and father. Counsel arranged for a sanity and competency evaluation before the first trial. Defendant was declared competent to stand trial, and an insanity defense could not be supported. Doctors came to the same conclusion as a result of their examinations. Whether the evaluation before the first trial generated any useful or alarming insights into defendant's mental history beyond competency and sanity was unknown. The evidence failed to preponderate against the trial court's finding that counsel's investigation and representation was within the wide range of professionally competent assistance. In addition, defendant was unable to show prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. There were no drugs or money found on defendant's person. Her presence in the area where drugs were found did not suffice to prove her possession. However, the State presented evidence that the other defendant had $ 395 in cash at the time he was searched and that the cocaine possessed by another individual had a value of approximately $ 380. A rational trier of fact could have inferred that defendant had recently possessed the cocaine prior to selling it to the other individual. An equally rational trier of fact could have inferred that defendant intended to buy the cocaine possessed by the other. In any event, in light of the finding that the evidence seized pursuant to the defective search warrant should have been suppressed, the money possessed by defendant was inadmissible &quot;fruit&quot; of the unconstitutional search.

After the convictions and sentences were affirmed and post-conviction relief was denied, petitioner sought a writ of error coram nobis relief. Petitioner asserted that he should be granted a new trial based upon grounds of newly discovered evidence. Specifically, petitioner claimed that a codefendant was willing to provide an affidavit and testimony that petitioner was not an accomplice in the commission of the criminal acts. The court held that, to the extent that petitioner sought the benefit of a writ of error coram nobis, his claim was time barred, because it was not filed within one year from the judgment's finality under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-7-103. Moreover, petitioner had not demonstrated the applicability of any basis upon which he could be excused from the statute of limitations bar. The codefendant's recantation would not have had an impact on the result of the trial. The codefendant's credibility was effectively questioned at trial. A police officer identified petitioner as being in the get-away vehicle, and stolen items were discovered at petitioner's home and in the car.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in admitting the videotape of the crime scene into evidence, because it was cumulative and it was &quot;gruesome and graphic.&quot; The court of appeals disagreed. The trial court found that the video aided the jury in understanding the testimony of medical examiners, crime scene investigators, and witnesses. The trial court noted that the jury was from Memphis and presumably unfamiliar with the area and Dunbar Cave State Park. The trial court also found that the video depicted the location of the bodies and was shown to document the position of the bodies in relation to the lake, the trail described by investigators and witnesses, the parking lot, and the cave. The trial court determined that the video was not &quot;particularly gruesome.&quot; Defendant advanced the argument that the video was graphic and gruesome only because the video showed the bodies of the victims as they were found at the crime scene. The crime scene video of most murders necessarily depicted the bodies of the victims as they were found. While the videotape and the other evidence might have contained some of the same material, it was not error to admit the videotape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While piloting a helicopter, a sheriff's department lieutenant observed what he believed to be several marijuana plants growing on property owned by defendant. After obtaining a search warrant based upon this surveillance, officers seized 17 marijuana plants, scales, plastic baggies, and other paraphernalia. Defendant raised three issues on appeal. The appellate court held that: (1) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress, because defendant had no reasonable expectation that the marijuana plants on his property were protected from observation by police flying in a helicopter at an altitude of 1,700 feet, the marijuana plants seized from defendant's property did not fall within the curtilage of defendant's residence and were, therefore, subject to seizure under the &quot;open fields&quot; doctrine, and aerial photographs introduced by defendant's private investigator at trial did not qualify as newly discovered evidence; (2) the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find defendant guilty of manufacturing between 10 and 19 marijuana plants; and (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering a sentence of confinement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's actions after stabbing the victim exhibited a coolness of purpose and a calculating demeanor. Defendant dragged the victim's body out of sight. He then removed personal belongings, including a gun, cash, and credit cards from the victim. Then, recognizing that he was unable to remove a vehicle from the victim's tow truck, defendant proceeded to drive the tow truck to a secluded location, where he eventually unloaded the vehicle. Defendant then proceeded to purchase a hamburger from a Wendy's drive-thru and visit a local AutoZone, before securing a different vehicle and obtaining a motel room in Union City. Upon a search of defendant's motel room, a bottle of men's hair dye was found. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner had pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter.

On appeal, the prisoner argued that proof of counsel's substance abuse was a late-arising claim that involved due process concerns. He also challenged his hybrid sentence as to voluntary manslaughter as illegal and unconstitutional. The appellate court noted that due process prohibited the strict application of the post-conviction statute of limitations, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102(a), when the grounds for relief arose after the point at which the limitations period would normally have begun to run. The appellate court held that alcohol or drug abuse by a defense attorney, without specific proof of its effect on performance, did not merit relief. The appellate court further held that offender classification and release eligibility were non-jurisdictional and were legitimate bargaining tools under the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his certified question defendant claimed that Tenn.

The court held that it was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the certified question did not dispose of all issues in the case. Defendant conceded that the relief he sought would not have resulted in the dismissal of the indictment; rather, the court would have had to remand the case for reconsideration of the charge of driving under the influence as a second offense.

Defendant escaped in the victim's car, discarded the weapon, and twice returned to search for his electronic pocket organizer. The court concluded that a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant intentionally and premeditatedly killed the victim. Post-mortem photographs of the victim were relevant to show that the wound was inflicted from contact range, from which a jury could infer premeditation and which dispelled defendant's claim of self-defense. Fingerprinting of defendant in the presence of the jury during the penalty phase of the trial was not so inflammatory or prejudicial as to render the trial fundamentally unfair. Any error in not allowing the jury to make the determination that defendant's prior felonies involved violence was harmless. Any rational juror would have found that the offenses, which all involved a firearm pointed at the victim, were violent felonies. The State's evidence was sufficient to establish the aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

As a result of the conviction, the trial court sentenced her to 21 years and six months incarceration as a range I, standard offender and classified her release eligibility at 100 percent as a violent offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State was required to prove that appellant, in giving her child a double dose of Clonidine, knowingly treated the child in an abusive manner, not that she merely knowingly gave him medication. The child abuse statutes were not unconstitutionally vague as applied to appellant because the statutes required that appellant knew her conduct was abusive. Also, the proof introduced at trial established that the child was taking Clonidine, and that five days after the prescription was written, appellant called the doctor's office three times in one day asking if she could increase the dosage. Each time appellant called, she was told that she was &quot;absolutely not&quot; to increase the dosage, but appellant admitted that she gave the child twice the prescribed dosage. Two days later, the child's father and aunt took him to the emergency room, where he exhibited signs and symptoms of Clonidine toxicity. A rational jury could have concluded that appellant knowingly gave her child twice his dosage of Clonidine against the instructions of medical professionals and that appellant knew her actions were abusive. The evidence supported the jury's finding of guilt.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the local district attorney had an open file policy and that the file along with the statements of the officers and the investigation of the case were available to defendant's attorneys and investigators. The trial court found that there was no evidence to suggest an insufficient investigation as a basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim nor any evidence to suggest prejudice in terms of guilt or innocence. In connection with the sentencing phase of the trial, the trial court found that there was no real mitigation evidence. As part of trial strategy, trial counsel chose not to use an expert, because she indicated that she would hurt their case. Additionally, defendant failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was prejudiced, and evidence that additional mitigation investigation would have caused a different result in sentencing was insufficient for defendant to carry his burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the law of the case doctrine prevented the State from seeking to change its position regarding the propriety of charging lesser-included offenses. The prosecution had the obligation to raise the constitutional challenge on direct appeal. The instant court's previous decision impliedly found the supreme court's decision in Ely not violative of the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Further, the supreme court's ruling defining lesser offenses under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-18-110 was not an unconstitutional abuse of the judiciary's power and did not constitute an infringement of the legislative branch's power to define criminal offenses. The General Assembly had the authority to define lesser offenses of the greater indicted offense. While directing trial courts to instruct on lesser offenses, the General Assembly failed to delineate what offenses were to be considered lesser offenses. Thus, the supreme court had the authority and the duty to intervene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee), which convicted him of first-degree premeditated murder. The jury found one aggravating circumstance pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(2), that defendant had been previously convicted of one or more violent felonies. The jury determined that the aggravating circumstance outweighed any mitigating circumstances and sentenced defendant to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that he killed his estranged wife, but claimed that he acted in a state of passion. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding expert testimony on diminished capacity, as the witness was unable to testify that defendant lacked the capacity to premeditate or to act intentionally or knowingly because of a mental disease or defect. Photographs demonstrating repeated blows to the head of the victim were relevant to show premeditation. Although the verdict form did not require the jury to note that the aggravating circumstances were found beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury could only have understood the burden of proof to apply to the determination of aggravating circumstances. Any error regarding an &quot;intentionally&quot; instruction was harmless, because the jury could find that defendant caused the death of the victim. An indictment sufficiently charged first-degree murder as the death penalty was within the statutory range of punishment. No international law prohibited the death penalty, and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(c) did not violate separation of powers. The sentence was not disproportionate to that imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found no reversible error. The officer's stop of defendant's car was justified by reasonable suspicion provided by an informant who called police stating that a car matching the description of defendant's vehicle was driving erratically. Therefore, evidence obtained during the stop was not subject to suppression. Defendant waived any issue regarding the admission into evidence of the breathalyzer test results at trial by his failure to make a timely objection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) of premeditated murder, two counts of felony murder, one count of aggravated rape, and one count of especially aggravated robbery. The felony murder convictions were merged into the premeditated murder convictions. Defendant received the death penalty. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his first-degree premeditated murder conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant used two weapons, scissors and a ligature, on unarmed victims. According to the evidence presented at trial, he inflicted multiple wounds to each victim during a very brutal attack. The evidence showed that he attempted to dispose of evidence of the murders by flushing his underwear down the toilet. Defendant was calm after the murders as he showered, changed his clothes, went through the victims' residence in search of valuables, washed his socks out in the sink, and flushed his underwear down the toilet. Moreover, after the murders, defendant drove to Missouri where he visited relatives and &quot;partied&quot; with friends. A witness testified that defendant told him that he committed the murders and explained that it was his fantasy to go on a rape and murder spree. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict of first-degree premeditated murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment referring to count 5 was actually for the aggravated rape conviction in count 6, and the judgment referring to count 6 was actually for the especially aggravated robbery conviction in count 5. The case was remanded for the trial court to correct those clerical errors. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for various narcotics charges arising out of the search of his vehicle. The Circuit Court for Dyer County (Tennessee) suppressed the evidence obtained as a result of that search, ruling that the search of defendant's vehicle was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the State's motion for an interlocutory appeal. The appellate court granted the State permission to appeal the judgment granting the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer testified that he witnessed defendant's car dive down as a result of unsafe breaking, which was caused by defendant's following the vehicle in front of him too closely in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-8-124(a) (1998). Conversely, defendant testified that his car did not dive down and that the reason for the rapid breaking was that the vehicle in front of him unexpectedly slowed almost to a stop. Defendant also presented evidence that the traffic stop might have been pretextual. The officer admitted that he was initially alerted to defendant's vehicle because of its Florida license plates. Thus, it was within the trial court's discretion to conclude that the officer had no reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant had violated &sect; 55-8-124(a) and the trial court correctly ruled that the traffic stop was invalid. Thus, the trial court did not erroneously grant defendant's motion to suppress the evidence derived from the subsequent search of defendant's vehicle. Because the record was void of any evidence against defendant not obtained as a result of the initial traffic stop, the trial court properly suppressed the evidence and dismissed the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court addressed many issues raised by defendant on appeal, but it was the failure to charge on lesser-included offenses that led to the reversal of defendant's convictions. The appellate court found that the failure to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offenses of facilitation and solicitation as lesser-included offenses of premeditated first-degree murder was error, as the jury could have found that defendant did not share the intent to commit premeditated first-degree murder with the principals. The appellate court also found that the trial court failed to instruct the jury regarding facilitation and solicitation as lesser-included offenses of especially aggravated kidnapping, because the jury could have concluded that defendant ordered the gang members to &quot;take him fishing,&quot; but that defendant did not intend for the kidnapping to be especially aggravated. Because the errors were not harmless, defendant was entitled to a new trial. Finally, the State could not seek the death penalty on remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal Court for Hamilton County (Tennessee), after a jury found him guilty of first degree premeditated murder, first degree felony murder, and especially aggravated robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dead body of the victim was found in a dumpster. Fingerprints found at the scene led police to defendant. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to suppress an incriminating statement he made, the jury charge regarding criminal responsibility was in error, and his sentencing was erroneous. The appellate court held that it was not error for the trial court to credit the testimony of a detective that defendant initiated contact with police and discredit the testimony of defendant, leading to the conclusion that the encounter at issue was not a custodial interrogation. Therefore, it was not error to fail to suppress the incriminating statement. Additionally, there was no error in the charge to the jury concerning criminal responsibility, because there was a theory that defendant shot the victim, and there was an alternate theory that another person shot the victim and defendant was criminally responsible for that person's actions. Finally, it was not a due process violation to use a prior conviction that occurred prior to the instant case's sentencing as satisfying the aggravating factor of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(2).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that the evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that the officers acted within reasonable bounds and in accordance with the law. After knocking on the back door, identifying themselves, and receiving no response, the officers, who had seen vehicles parked outside the residence, opened the back door and heard a television. When they announced themselves a second time, they heard the affirmative reply, &quot;Yeah.&quot; Defendant's reply could reasonably have been construed as consent to the officers' presence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Carroll County, Tennessee, convicted defendant of DUI, third offense, and driving while license suspended, fifth offense. He was sentenced, respectively, to 11 months and 29 days, with all but 180 days suspended, and six months, with all but 45 days suspended, the sentences to be served concurrently. Defendant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer &quot;clocked&quot; defendant's truck at a speed of 47 miles per hour in a 35 mile per hour zone. Defendant staggered out of his vehicle when it was stopped. The officer smelled alcohol on the defendant, and determined that his license had been revoked. Defendant refused to take a breathalyzer test. On review, defendant argued the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for third offense DUI and that his sentence for 11 months and 29 days was excessive. The appellate court disagreed. Defendant was not entitled a verdict of not guilty merely because he presented more witnesses than the State. Implicit in the jury's verdict was its finding that the State's witnesses, testifying that the defendant was intoxicated as he operated his truck, were credible.  Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403(a)(1) required that a defendant be sentenced to a minimum period of confinement of 120 days. The trial court was permitted to use his prior California DUI convictions for enhancement purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was acquitted of several crimes by reason of insanity. He was ordered to participate in a mandatory outpatient treatment program under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 33-7-303(a). Several years later, the patient filed a motion seeking release from the program because the State failed to renew his obligation under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 33-6-621. After the trial court denied the motion, the patient sought review. In affirming, the court held that the trial court properly found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 33-7-303(a) applied to the case because it established the standard by which a person acquitted based on insanity could have been compelled to participate in such a program. The State was not required to seek a biannual renewal of the obligation to participate in such a program. There was no evidence that the legislature intended for Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 33-6-621 to apply to insanity acquittees. The court declined to review the patient's challenge to the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 33-7-303 because it was not raised at the trial court level. Finally, the court found that the trial court had the authority to release the patient from his obligation to participate in the program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from the Criminal Court for Hamilton County (Tennessee), following their convictions by a jury trial, for disrupting a meeting, in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-306(a), and, as to one defendant, of resisting arrest, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-16-602(a). On appeal, they challenged the jury selection, jury instructions, and the sufficiency of the evidence of guilt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The African-American defendants were alleged to have interrupted a city counsel meeting, taking over the podium at a time when they were not scheduled to speak. A videotape of the council meeting was shown to the jury. First, defendants argued that the State improperly excluded four African-American jurors with peremptory challenges in violation of Article I, section 8 of the Tennessee Constitution and of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's finding that each juror was properly challenged for non-racial reasons. Defendants also claimed the statute was unconstitutional, but it had been found to be a valid restraint of free speech. The trial court erred in giving the jury a &quot;knowing and reckless&quot; mens rea instruction for the offense of disrupting a meeting, as the statute required specific intent, but the error was harmless, given the videotape evidence. An error concerning questioning of a police witness as to the use of force in resisting arrest was also harmless. A defendant placed in a diversion program had no right to appeal.</SPAN></P>

He also contested his warrantless arrest. Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the legislature's exclusion of criminal acts in violation of the gambling statutes from those criminal activities which could lead to punishment for prohibited acts of money laundering violated the equal protection of law provisions of Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8 and art. I, &sect; 8. The appellate court's review of the legislative history of the Money Laundering Act indicated that the gambling laws were exempted from the definition of &quot;specified unlawful activity&quot; because a majority of the members of the Tennessee House of Representatives did not feel that the money laundering statute should be applied to gambling acts which might be considered minor offenses. The clear implication was that the Tennessee House of Representatives approved the act in order to enable law enforcement to combat money laundering in other offenses considered to be more serious by the legislative body. The legislative history supported the constitutionality of the statute by establishing that the reasonableness of the classification was at least &quot;fairly debatable.&quot; Thus, the money laundering statutes did not violate the Tennessee Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court considered appellant's arguments on review and held as follows. The indictment's failure to allege a capital offense did not render the sentence of death invalid. Appellant failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from the denial of his right to a speedy trial. Appellant's custodial statement to the police regarding his involvement in the murder was admissible. Counsel's decision to allow testimony regarding the gang was tactical. Hearsay statements between appellant and the co-defendant were admissible under the co-conspirator exception, Tenn. R. Evid. 803(1.2)(E). In light of the aggravating circumstances under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped after the police officer observed his crossing the dividing lines of a highway. The officer noticed the smell of alcohol as he approached the car. Defendant failed his field sobriety tests and refused to take a chemical sobriety test, although he was told by the officer that refusal to take the test could result in the suspension of defendant's driver's license. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding that defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol. Specifically, the evidence showed that defendant was weaving his car and admitted to drinking alcohol on the night of the arrest, that whiskey bottles were found in defendant's car, and that the evidence of his erratic driving and performance on the sobriety tests was reinforced by a videotape of the arrest. The court also found that the trial court did exactly as Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-201(b) required in disallowing questions to the jury about their opinion concerning potential incarceration. Disallowing voir dire questioning about whether a juror would trust his freedom to a machine (the breathalyzer) was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered the home of the victim, a widow in her 80s, took her by the arm, pushed her down on her bed, covered her head with a pillow, and asked where her money was. Defendant also performed and attempted to perform sexual acts on the victim. The detective informed defendant of his Miranda rights, and defendant effectively waived those rights. Also, the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to establish defendant's identity as the perpetrator. Additionally, because defendant's actions in tying the victim up certainly increased her risk of harm and gave defendant at least some additional time in which to effect his flight, thereby lessening his risk of detection, defendant's aggravated kidnapping conviction was appropriate. Further, the trial court committed reversible error in failing to instruct the jury on sexual battery as a lesser-included offense of aggravated rape and theft as a lesser-included offense of robbery; thus, he had to be retried on the two charges of rape and the robbery charge. Finally, because the trial court properly applied two enhancement factors to defendant's sentences, the length of the terms of each of his sentences were appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed and remanded for retrial defendant's convictions of robbery and rape.

Code Ann. &sect; 37-1-134(a) did not preclude a conviction of a transferred juvenile tried as an adult from being used as an aggravating circumstance in a subsequent capital case; (3) defendant was required to file a pre-trial notice of his intent to present expert testimony regarding mental health condition as mitigation evidence at the sentencing phase; (4) autopsy reports were properly admitted as business and public records; (5) victim impact evidence was admissible; (6) the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's determination that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt; and (7) the penalty imposed by the jury was not disproportionate to the penalty imposed by the jury for similar crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended the trial court erroneously admitted statements on the videotape of the stop indicating defendant's vehicle would be seized. Defendant argued that this was evidence of other crimes prohibited by Tenn. R. Evid. 404(b). The appellate court was unable to conclude that the jury would have been aware that it was a subsequent DUI. Any error was harmless, as defendant was convicted of DUI per se. Defendant did not show that the state trooper had sufficient expertise to qualify him to give the opinion that defendant's blood alcohol content was rising at the time of the withdrawal of the blood. The trooper's ultimate response was that he did not know whether the blood alcohol content was rising or falling. Expert extrapolation testing was not required in a DUI prosecution. Evidence of defendant's physical condition at the time of arrest or at the time of administration of the test was relevant to the issue of blood alcohol content. The blood withdrawal approximately 55 minutes after the stop was reasonable, and the 0.12 percent result justified the conclusion that defendant had a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent or more at the time he was driving.</SPAN></P>

He drove defendants and the others to his home; everyone escaped, though one defendant fired warning shots. Defendants argued that the removal of the victims from the initial scene was incidental to the attempted robbery and, thus, the evidence was insufficient to convict them of aggravated kidnapping. The appellate court disagreed; the attempted aggravated robbery was fully consummated when defendants transported victims at gunpoint to a different location in their hope for further gain. No plea bargain existed to enforce, and the prosecutor was not guilty of misconduct. As defendants made no showing that the pre-trial delay impaired their defense, they failed to establish a speedy trial violation. Neither defendant establish that his trial counsel was ineffective. The trial court improperly applied the enhancement factor of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-114(3) in finding the offense involved more than one victim, as the jury acquitted defendants of all offenses against all but one of the victims; however, the remaining enhancement factors justified the sentences imposed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant admitted he had consumed two beers that evening, and the officer found a partially consumed can of beer in defendant's truck. A third witness testified he was with defendant during the time period in question and saw defendant drink one or two beers. The trial court found defendant's blood was drawn within 30 to 40 minutes of him driving his truck and that his blood alcohol concentration was .13 percent. On appeal, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to convict. Specifically, he argued the trial court failed to require the State to prove his blood alcohol content was .10 percent or more at the time he was driving. The appeals court held the evidence was sufficient. The arresting officer's testimony, the police dispatcher's log, and the laboratory report supported the trial court's finding that defendant's blood was drawn within about 40 minutes of his driving.

The appellate court held defendant was not denied his right to counsel at trial, as counsel was appointed after he waived a jury. While he was entitled to counsel when waiving a jury, and was not advised of that right, the absence of counsel did not invalidate his waiver, as the trial court was responding to his request for a speedy trial, and, if the trial court erred in allowing defendant to waive a jury pro se, counsel did not try to withdraw this waiver, and had adequate time to do so. Defendant did not show he did not understand the waiver or that the absence of counsel prejudiced him. Tenn. R. Crim. P. 23 required only that, in waiving a jury, defendant execute a written waiver, which was done. While the trial court did not have a colloquy with defendant about his waiver, as required absent a written waiver, his waiver, consented to by the prosecutor and the trial court, satisfied the requirements of Rule 23.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, and especially aggravated robbery in the Criminal Court for Shelby County (Tennessee). On appeal, the instant court affirmed both convictions, but reversed defendant's death sentence, and remanded it for resentencing. Defendant was then given a life sentence which was ordered to be served consecutively to the original 20-year sentence for especially aggravated robbery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue on appeal was whether the trial court was required to revisit the issue of whether the new murder sentence was to run consecutive to, or concurrent with, the original robbery sentence when the case was remanded for resentencing. The instant court affirmed the trial court's imposition of consecutive sentencing, remanding to determine the sentence for the first degree murder conviction. While not an explicit limitation of the scope of the remand, the implication of the remand was that the issue of consecutive sentencing need not be revisited. The law of the case doctrine proscribed reconsideration of the issue. None of the limited exceptions to the law of the case doctrine applied to defendant's case. Accordingly, the trial court's refusal to reconsider the issue was not error. Further the trial court correctly applied criteria Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-115(b)(2) and (4), that defendant was an offender whose record of criminal activity was extensive, and that defendant was a dangerous offender whose behavior indicates little or no regard for human life. None of the evidence defendant presented at the resentencing hearing rebutted the application of those factors.</SPAN></P>

An appeal as of right was not available for review of a lower court's denial of a motion to reopen a petition for post-conviction relief. The failure of defendant to comply with statutory requirements governing review of a denial of a motion to reopen deprived the appellate court of jurisdiction.

Petitioner contended that the trial court lacked the authority to render the judgment against him. A handwritten note by the trial judge on the indictment indicated amendments to the indictment.

The appellate court concluded that the indictment in this case clearly apprized the petitioner of the crimes of which he was charged, that it furnished the trial court an adequate basis for the entry of its judgment, and that it protected the petitioner from double jeopardy. The indictment, even as modified, was not so defective as to deprive the trial court of jurisdiction. Petitioner also challenged the constitutionality of the 1982 first degree murder statute. The appellate court concluded, however, that the statute in this case was sufficiently precise to have put petitioner on notice of the charges against him. The appellate court also concluded that a person of common intelligence could reasonably understand what acts the statute proscribed. The statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the issue of consent presented a jury question. It was the prerogative of the jury to accredit the victim's testimony. There was sufficient evidence to establish that defendant knew or should have known that his sexual advances upon the victim were not welcome. The record was unclear as to whether defendant had been arrested or advised of his Miranda rights at the time he was interviewed by the detective. Because it was defendant's duty to supply an adequate record for review, the cross-examination about his post-arrest silence was not in error. Any error was harmless as defendant's explanation for his silence--that the detective had failed to advise him of the subject of the interview--was plausible. The trial court properly applied enhancement factors under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-114 and two possible mitigating factors warranted little weight.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Carroll County (Tennessee) of aggravated burglary, aggravated rape, and class E felony theft. He received an effective 25-year sentence. On appeal, defendant raised the following issues for review, inter alia: whether the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress, whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts, and whether his sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that evidence found inside his &quot;living quarters&quot; should have been suppressed, as the person who granted the waiver to search was without authority to do so. The evidence established that defendant had been staying at the residence for approximately two to three weeks at the time the search of the premises was conducted. Defendant stated he was staying in his co-defendant's trailer for a time, because he was in between houses. The appellate court concluded, contrary to the ruling of the trial court, that defendant did have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the residence and, therefore, had standing to challenge the validity of the search. The appellate court also concluded that the property owner did not have authority to permit a search of the residence. She did not live at the trailer; therefore, she did not possess authority over its premises. Accordingly, the search of the premises was unconstitutional, and the evidence seized during the search was inadmissible. However, given the strength of the State's case, no prejudice to defendant occurred as a result of the evidence being admitted. Any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of abusing their foster children by whipping them and burning them with cigarettes. Defendants argued that the evidence was insufficient and that the trial judge should have granted their motion for acquittals. The appellate court held that the evidence was sufficient, as the jury chose to believe the testimony of a doctor and one of the victims as to the nature of the abuse over that of defendants', who denied abusing the children or having knowledge of the cord that was used to whip the children. The appellate court held the trial court did not err in allowing the wife to be questioned about the income she received from the State for being a foster parent, as it went to the wife's claims of altruistic motives for taking the children. Also, questions regarding the husband's prior record of abuse of children was not in error, as the objection to the admission of the evidence was not preserved, and there was insufficient evidence to find plain error.

The appellate court found that the trial court erred by dismissing the petition on the basis of Tenn.

However, the petition was subject to summary dismissal on the grounds that it was time barred under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-202(a). Defendant's complaint was that his indictment and jury instructions did not sufficiently differentiate the terms &quot;premeditation&quot; and &quot;deliberation.&quot; Prior caselaw did not create a new constitutional right requiring the appellate court to reexamine defendant's indictment and jury instructions. Defendant's assertion did not rise to the level of new evidence required to toll the statute of limitations, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-202(b)(2). Defendant's claim for relief upon error coram nobis was also time-barred, because it was not filed within one year of the date on which the judgment of conviction became final in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court granted review and found no error. Considering the entire record, the sentence of death was not imposed in any arbitrary fashion. The evidence fully supported the jury's findings as to the statutory aggravating circumstance. The aggravating circumstance outweighed mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. A comparative proportionality review demonstrated that the sentence of death was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the convicting evidence, as it related to the element of premeditation; and the trial court's ruling which he asserted interfered with the defense's order of proof, thus, forcing a premature election on defendant's right to testify. The court of criminal appeals held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The proof produced at trial established that it was not the normal routine of the victim to enter the residence when picking up her child, and she told her roommate that she would return in five minutes. Defendant told his children to leave the residence during the time the victim would be picking up the child following visitation with defendant. No one saw the victim enter with a gun. No fingerprints were found on the gun located by the victim's body. It was the gun which defendant possessed, however, that produced the fatal wound. Also, defendant had several motives for the killing. The court of criminal appeals also held that the trial court did not reversibly err by insisting defendant testify before his other witnesses testified.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, defendant refused to testify as required by his plea agreement, instead, moving to withdraw his guilty pleas. That motion was denied, the State withdrew its sentencing recommendation, and a sentencing hearing was held. The jury, at the sentencing hearing, found the statutory aggravating circumstance that the defendant had previously been convicted of a felony involving violence to the person and sentenced the defendant to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the movement and confinement of the victim was essentially incidental to the accomplishment of the aggravated rape and first degree murder and was, therefore, insufficient to support a separate conviction for especially aggravated kidnapping. The court of appeals agreed. The evidence established that the victim's pants and panties were pulled down around her ankles, which restricted the use of her legs. Additionally, her shirt was raised, and her arms tucked inside, which restricted the use of her arms. Finally, she was gagged with her own socks. The restraint of the victim was incidental to the rape and did not support a separate conviction for kidnapping. Notwithstanding the resulting restraint of the victim's movement, removal of the victim's clothing was part and parcel of the act of rape. Because there was no other evidence of any further confinement, movement, or restraint of the victim, defendant's conviction for especially aggravated kidnapping was not supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
