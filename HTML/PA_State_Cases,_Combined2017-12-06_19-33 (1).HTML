R. Crim. P. 542(E) allowed only hearsay evidence to support a finding of a prima facie case against defendant of various charges, as it was not in conflict with any binding precedent; [3]-Moreover, defendant did not have a constitutional right under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Defendant's DUI conviction was improper because there existed no differing standards for setting up DUI and non-DUI checkpoints and the sergeant's generalized testimony provided no specifics whatsoever regarding accidents, arrests, citations, or violations regarding seatbelt usage or non-usage at the specific checkpoint location, nor did it present any insight into the selection of the checkpoint time and duration. Therefore, the testimony did not satisfy the requirements of the Tarbert/Blouse guidelines; [2]-Because the Commonwealth's only evidence as to the selection of the location of this checkpoint was the sergeant general testimony, the trial court should have suppressed all evidence resulting from the stop at the seatbelt checkpoint.</SPAN></P>

Rather, the parole agents were performing their supervisory duties by visiting defendant at his home to ensure his compliance with the conditions of his probation; [2]-Given that the parole agents were visiting defendant at his residence in accordance with their supervisory duties, the smell of marijuana gave rise to reasonable suspicion for the agents to conduct a search for the contraband that was ultimately located in the basement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of various offenses, including driving under the influence (DUI) under 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(a), homicide by vehicle while DUI, and aggravated assault by vehicle while DUI. Defendant contended, in part, that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's statement to an investigating officer following the accident, which resulted in the death of one child and severe injuries to another, was not given while he was in custody for Miranda purposes and, thus, was not subject to suppression on the basis that Miranda warnings were not first given. The statement was given to the officer after the officer knocked on the door of defendant's and asked him a question about his identity and another question about his vehicle ownership. The circumstances surrounding defendant's oral incrimination lacked any indicia of restricting his freedom. Further, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions as, although there was an eleven-hour time lapse between defendant's accident and the blood test, a forensic expert testified to a reasonable degree of certainty that defendant's BAC was at least 0.08 percent a the time of the accident, defendant admitted that he had an accident while drunk, officers found an open bottle of beer in the car, and another witness testified that defendant appeared intoxicated a few hours before the accident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Court of Common Pleas, Allegheny County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), of second-degree murder, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2502(b), robbery, carrying a firearm without a license, and possession of a firearm by a minor. He was sentenced to, inter alia, a mandatory term of life in prison without the possibility of parole for second-degree murder. He appealed his convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said his convictions were against the weight of the evidence because incredible witnesses linked him to the crimes. The appellate court held sufficient evidence supported the convictions because (1) the trial court, which saw the witnesses testify, found the verdict was not contrary to the evidence and did not shock its sense of justice, and (2) the record showed this was not an abuse of discretion. It was not error to admit a gun not conclusively identified as the murder weapon because (1) it was the same caliber as that weapon and its test bullet had the same characteristics as one removed from the victim, tending to show defendant had a gun similar to the murder weapon, and (2) no &quot;scientific link&quot; between the gun and the murder bullet was necessary. Defendant's sentence had to be vacated because (1) he was 16 when the crimes were committed, (2) the U.S. Supreme Court held a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole for crimes committed when the perpetrator was under 18 violated the Eighth Amendment, and (3) defendant's cruel and unusual punishment claim raised an unwaivable question of the sentence's legality, which could be raised initially on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was vacated, and the matter was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that an officer effectuated a detention of defendant without at least reasonable suspicion under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The appellate court disagreed. Defendant had not been detained prior to the time the officer removed the receipt from defendant's shopping bag, and reasonable suspicion was not necessary for the officer to approach him. However, the officer, who had thirteen years of experience in investigating criminal offenses committed by pickpockets also had had prior contact with defendant on numerous occasions in connection with forgery and theft offenses. Defendant lied in response to the officer's inquiry regarding what he was doing, and he provided the officer with a false name. That elusive behavior coupled with the high crime area where the officer found defendant and his prior contact with him provided the reasonable suspicion necessary for the officer to detain defendant in an effort to investigate the manner in which defendant had made his purchases. The trial court stressed that the officer testified the receipt had been on top of the bag and, therefore, was immediately accessible and in view.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania) of three counts each of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and third-degree murder. Defendant was also convicted of multiple counts of kidnapping and robbery, and one count of indecent assault. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his kidnapping and second-degree murder convictions under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2901. The superior court agreed. The Commonwealth and the trial court focused on defendant's binding of the victims and repeated terrorizing of them with verbal threats and a firearm. While those facts were disturbing and heinous in nature, they were subsidiary to the core crimes that defendant was committing. Defendant's objective was to murder, rob, and sexually assault. Defendant did not secrete the victims in an attic, closet, or basement so that discovery would be made more difficult, nor was it a case where he prevented police from gaining access to the victims once they arrived on the scene. The likelihood of discovery was recognized by both the victims and defendant due to the awareness that a person would soon be arriving home. The facts lead to the conclusion that the victims' confinement was incidental to defendant's other acts. Therefore, the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions for kidnapping and second-degree murder based upon the kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for kidnapping and second-degree murder were reversed. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the sentencing court did not abuse its discretion. Despite defendant's contention that the sentencing court made no finding that he was likely to commit a new crime, the sentencing court stated that it was absolutely convinced that he would commit more violence to anyone around him, and certainly sexual violence upon women. The sentencing court also noted an outburst by defendant which contradicted testimony that he did not display anger or assign blame to others. Next, defendant did not raise a substantial question that his sentence was inappropriate under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9721(b). Were the court to reach the merits, however, it would find that the sentencing court did not abuse its discretion. The sentencing court heard ample testimony and reviewed numerous documents which led it to conclude the sentence imposed was justifiable and necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which convicted her of disorderly conduct, disrupting a procession, and conspiracy to disrupt a procession, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 5503(a)(3), 5508, and 903(a)(1). She was sentenced to an aggregate term of probation and to community service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a funeral procession for a sheriff's deputy who was killed in the line of duty, defendant and her co-defendant crossed the street and walked through the procession. While doing so, they shouted slurs at the police multiple times, which caused observers of the procession to react with disgust. The police stopped them and they were arrested for interrupting a procession and disorderly conduct. Defendant was thereafter convicted of several offenses and sentence was imposed. On appeal, the court found that defendant's constitutional challenges to &sect; 5508 lacked merit. The statute was not impermissibly vague or facially overbroad, based on the language used. Moreover, an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge failed, as the mens rea and actus reus were not too ambiguous. Further, defendant's words and actions were not protected pure speech. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions for disrupting a procession and conspiracy, based on defendant's words and actions, together with her co-defendant's conduct. However, the evidence did not support the disorderly conduct conviction. Accordingly, a new sentence was warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the conviction for disorderly conduct, but affirmed the remaining convictions. The matter was remanded for imposition of a new sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant subcontractor (SC) sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), which sustained the preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer of appellee property owners (POs), struck the SC's complaint for a mechanics' lien (ML) under 49 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1201(12)(a), and dismissed the claim with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The SC allegedly performed excavation and related work at the POs' property pursuant to a contract between the SC and the POs' general contractor. Further, the SC alleged that after completion of its work, it timely filed its ML claim. The POs filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, which were sustained by the trial court. It found that the ML for the excavation work was barred because it was incidental to planned construction, but that a structure was never erected. A three-judge panel of the appellate court reversed the trial court order, holding that it did not appear with certainty that the law precluded recovery. En banc review of the panel decision was thereafter granted. The court found that the trial court's decision was based upon a single disputed averment in the POs' preliminary objections, which was a misapplication of the law. Rather, the reasonable inference drawn from the SC's factual averments was that it performed its excavation incidental to the proposed construction of the two-building project. Despite the fact that the POs failed to complete the construction, the SC's acts were incidental to construction or erection pursuant to &sect; 1201(12)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which convicted him, under an accomplice theory of liability pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 306, for the delivery of a controlled substance. However, he was acquitted of a charge of criminal conspiracy. The court granted en banc review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove his cousin to a bar, where the cousin consummated a sale of narcotics to an undercover agent. During the transaction, defendant gave his car keys to his cousin in order to allow him to retrieve the narcotics. Additionally, defendant was intermittently present while the transaction was discussed, although he did not participate directly in the transaction. After the cousin sold the drugs to the agent, both defendant and the cousin were arrested as they left the bar. The jury convicted defendant as an accomplice. On appeal, the court held that the weight and sufficiency of the evidence established that defendant had knowledge of and participated in the illegal drug sale for purposes of finding accomplice liability. The agent, who was qualified as an expert, was properly allowed to testify that drug dealers often compensated drivers for their service, as it was helpful to the jury. There was no prosecutorial misconduct during the trial, and defendant failed to show that he was the victim of sentencing &quot;manipulation&quot; by the Commonwealth. Lastly, challenges to the constitutionality of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7508 under equal protection and substantive due process lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellant contended that his due process rights were violated by the failure to record his interrogation and confession. Appellant argued that the failure to record his interrogation deprived him of an opportunity to establish that his confession was involuntary and the product of police coercion. The court found no error, noting that the Pennsylvania Constitution did not require contemporaneous recording of statements. The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by precluding a proposed expert to testify regarding the phenomenon of false confessions because the court properly found that specialized knowledge was not required on the subject. The court also determined that the trial court did not err in directing appellant to turn over verbatim or substantially verbatim statements of defense witnesses because the order applied only to statements signed, adopted or otherwise shown to be substantially verbatim statements, which was in accordance with established law, and did not approve mutual discovery. The court also found that appellant's confession was voluntary and that the protective sweep conducted of appellant's residence was justified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions by the Court of Common Pleas of Greene County (Pennsylvania) for possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. Defendant challenged the denial of his motion to suppress the contraband recovered in the vehicle search following a traffic stop. Defendant argued, inter alia, that an officer had neither reasonable suspicion nor probable cause to stop a truck in the first place.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer observed a truck, driven by defendant, make a left turn without using a turn signal. The officer signaled for the truck to stop. As he approached, the officer saw a passenger make a move that the officer believed indicated the presence of a gun. After another officer arrived, the officers opened the passenger door and found marijuana on the seat next to the passenger. After lifting jackets on the seat, they discovered more bags of marijuana. Upon defendant's consent, the officers searched the truck and found additional evidence. No weapons were found. The appellate court held that defendant clearly violated 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3334 by failing to use a signal. Therefore, the officer was justified in initiating the traffic stop. The truck was owned by another person. Thus, defendant failed to establish a legally cognizable expectation of privacy necessary for him to prevail on his challenge of the constitutionality of the search. The specific facts and the reasonable inferences, viewed in the totality of the circumstances, supported the determination that a reasonably prudent person would be warranted in believing that the passenger may have had immediate access to a weapon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which granted defendants' motion to suppress the results of a Global Positioning System (GPS) device.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court erred in granting defendant one's motion to suppress as defendant one neither asserted a property right within the meaning of U.S. v. Jones nor showed a legitimate expectation of privacy. Defendant one did not own the car in question, she did not have any possessory interest in the car, she never drove the car, and she was not a passenger in the car at the time that the GPS device was installed. Further, defendant two failed to demonstrate a possessory interest in the vehicle or a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle. Yet, even if the court were to find that defendant two had shown a reasonable expectation of privacy, United States v. Jones did not apply as there was nothing in it that would support the notion that a GPS device placed onto a vehicle in full compliance with &sect; 5761 of Pennsylvania's Wiretap Act offended either U.S. Const. amend. IV or Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Finally, even if a finding of probable cause were required for the issuance of a search warrant, this standard was met. There was probable cause to believe that defendant was using the vehicle to engage in drug trafficking and that use of a GPS devise would aid in the investigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), granting defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the Commonwealth met its burden of establishing the legality of the warrantless protective sweep of defendant's vehicle. The appeals court concluded that the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence to save a firearm discovered in the center console of the vehicle from suppression. On a record that established nothing more than a late night stop of a vehicle suspected of having illegally tinted windows whose driver exhibited nervousness while complying with officers' orders to lower the windows and produce license, insurance and registration information, the Commonwealth did not meet its burden of establishing the legality of the search. The suppression hearing transcript contained no information about an officer's level of training or experience in conducting traffic stops (or even years of service) and was devoid of any testimony that the officer believed, based on his training and experience, that defendant possessed a weapon or had access to a weapon in his vehicle. When the decision was made to conduct a Terry frisk and protective search, the vehicle's window was down, and the window tint had receded as a factor.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant raised certain issues on appeal. The court affirmed the convictions, but vacated his sentence and remanded. Assuming appellant preserved the issue that the jury could only have guessed as to whether out-of-court statements were true, this did not entitle him to relief. The jury was apprised of the discrepancies between the in-court testimony and the out-of-court statements, and as prior inconsistent statements were admissible as substantive evidence, the testimony of other witnesses provided an indicium of reliability of the out-of-court statements. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling on the weight issue. A new law, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1102.1, distinguished between defendants convicted of first-degree murder and second-degree murder and divided punishment for those younger than 15 at the time of the crime and those 15 and over. The legislature outlined factors a court had to consider in determining whether to sentence a defendant to life imprisonment without parole or another provision. The court found these considerations were applicable to appellant, who was 16 years old at the time of the offense, and thus the court remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents brought an action for wrongful birth and wrongful life against appellees, physicians and medical entities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 8305 barred claims for wrongful birth and wrongful life. The court held that the statute violated the single-subject rule of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. The primary purposes of SB 646, signed into law as Act 47, was to address post-trial matters in criminal cases. Most of the amendments contained in SB 646 were germane to that primary purpose. Four amendments -- 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1125 (regarding the appointment of substitute bail commissioners in Philadelphia), &sect; 8305 (prohibiting a cause of action for wrongful birth and wrongful life), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;  8306 (limiting the defenses available for injuries sustained in utero), and 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8933 (regarding the dismissal of felony criminal actions at the preliminary hearing level) -- were not germane to that primary purpose, and thus were unconstitutional under the single-subject rule of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3.  Those four provisions, however, were severable from the remainder of Act 47, and thus were the only provisions stricken. Because &sect; 8305 was unconstitutional, the trial court erred in granting appellees' preliminary objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of the preliminary objections, reinstated the amended complaint, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juveniles sought review of the orders issued by the juvenile section of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) that denied both petitions to expunge their juvenile records. Appellants asserted that 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9123(a)(4) was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the extent it permitted the denial of expungement based solely upon the Commonwealth's refusal to consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellants also contested allowing the prosecutor to unilaterally block a petition for expungement when all other statutory criteria were met. The juvenile court opined that because 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9123(a)(4), the applicable section of the Criminal History Record Information Act, required the consent of the Commonwealth to grant expungement, it was compelled to deny both appellants' petitions. However, the juvenile court acknowledged that if the Commonwealth's consents were not required, it would have granted both petitions because it believed that expungement would serve the interests of the public and the juvenile. The appellate court held the intent of the legislature was evident. Moreover, it was apparent that the juvenile court's interpretation and application of the statute was in compliance with both the language of the statute and the legislature's intent. Although the language of Juvenile Court Rule 170(E) appeared to conflict with the statutory language, in actuality it did not. The juvenile court correctly applied the statute when it denied both appellants' petitions for expungement due to the Commonwealth's refusal to consent as required under section 9123(a)(4).</SPAN></P>

The wife complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) and the trial court filed a responsive opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6111.2 was not applied retroactively and that the trial court did not violate the Contract Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1. The wife's contract expectancy did not arise until about December 21, 2003, when the decedent designated her as a primary beneficiary to receive 80 percent of the life insurance proceeds. Parsonese did not apply. On the change of beneficiary form, the decedent specifically indicated the wife was his wife. Although there was a box that the decedent could have checked indicating the designation was irrevocable, he did not check the box. It did not appear from the face of the beneficiary designation that the wife's designation as a beneficiary was intended to survive the divorce. The property settlement agreement also did not show the wife's designation as a beneficiary was intended to survive the divorce. Rather, it included a provision by which the decedent and the wife mutually agreed to relinquish all rights against each other and their estates arising from the marital relationship. The trial court did not err in construing the life insurance policy as if the wife had predeceased the decedent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that defendant was improperly sentenced as under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9718.2(a)(2). The appellate court was bound by Shiffler, which had interpreted identical language in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9714(a)(2) to require two opportunities to reform. Defendant had committed two prior offenses on separate dates against two separate victims. However, he pled guilty at the same hearing, and was sentenced at the same hearing to concurrent sentences. Defendant had never been sentenced as a second strike offender, and had had only one opportunity to reform. Although this offense was defendant's third conviction of a crime that required him to register as a sexual offender resulting from three separate criminal transactions, he should have been sentenced as a second-strike offender under &sect; 9718.2(a)(1). Sufficient evidence supported the attempted rape of a child conviction. The Commonwealth did not have to prove that defendant knew that the victim was under the age of 13 as under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3102, defendant's belief as to the victim's age was irrelevant for any inchoate crime involving the crime of rape of a child. The prosecutor did not commit prosecutorial misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas, Allegheny County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which imposed a period of incarceration on him for his violation of probation pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9771(b). He had been previously convicted of sexual offenses and related crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with multiple offenses, arising from his sexual assault of a young girl over a four-year period that started when she was six years old, his attempts to lure a 12-year-old girl into his car, and an incident when he exposed himself to an adult female. He entered guilty pleas to charges under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3121, 3123, 4304, and 6301, and periods of incarceration and then probation were imposed. Defendant violated his probation, and consecutive terms of imprisonment that were imposed were vacated on appeal two times. Thereafter, the trial court imposed a term of incarceration. On appeal again, the court conducted a review of case precedents and concluded that the trial court's failure to comply with 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9771(c) implicated illegal sentence issues. However, pursuant to Pa. R. Crim. P. 708(C)(2) and defendant's failure to include the issue in his Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement, there was a waiver of the argument. The trial court's sentence was not excessive under &sect; 9771(b), based on the circumstances and the determination that his violation was not &quot;de minimus&quot; or merely technical.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her sentence by the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County (Pennsylvania) following her conviction for violations of the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 780-113(a)(30) and (16). She was sentenced pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7508 to the mandatory minimum sentence. The issue was whether 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;7508(a)(2) was unconstitutional and violated defendant's right to Equal Protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant delivered 33 Percocet pills to a police informant. The 33 pills had an aggregate weight of 17.4 grams; however, only 330 mg of that weight was the pure narcotic, Oxycodone, the remaining weight was Acetaminophen, binders, and fillers. The appellate court held there was no meaningful difference between the sentencing treatment of pills such as Percocet, Lorcet, and Dilaudid, and LSD, cocaine. Controlled substances were typically sold in a diluted state. In cases where the controlled substance was &quot;cut,&quot; the substance was rendered more harmful to society because the dilution increased the potential number of persons who would partake of the proscribed controlled substance. The increased potential for harm to society justified the imposition of more severe penalties for the possession of large amounts of a diluted controlled substance than for smaller amounts of a pure controlled substance. Defendant failed to develop an argument for a constitutional distinction. Thus, a sentencing scheme based upon the aggregate weight of pills containing a controlled substance, including Oxycodone, did not violate either the Federal or Commonwealth Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

Before FINLEY, J.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County (Pennsylvania), defendant was given a mandatory sentence under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9718.2 of 25 to 50 years' incarceration for unlawful contact with a minor and other offenses related to his sexual contact with two minors. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that the trial court did not err in permitting the victims' out-of-court statements to be entered into evidence under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5985.1(a)(1). The initial statement by the first victim was spontaneous and internally consistent, and its reliability was bolstered by other factors. Although the second victim's statement was made after her mother initiated the conversation, there was no evidence that the second victim knew about the first victim's allegation or that the questioning was suggestive. Next, once defendant opened the door by raising doubts by means of expert testimony regarding his capability to engage in sexual activity, the Commonwealth's expert's foray into his ability to ejaculate was not improper. The trial court did not err under Pa. R. Crim. P. 646 in allowing the first victim's handwritten statement to go out to the jury during its deliberations. Any potential prejudice was mitigated. Finally, &sect; 9718.2 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII as applied to defendant. The acts of sexual abuse of two children over several years, even when such abuse fell short of rape, constituted offenses of sufficient gravity as to permit a severe sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and his identical twin brother approached the victim, who was sitting in a car, and told him to get out.

On appeal, defendant asserted that his sentence was illegal under &sect; 9712.1 because he legally possessed the firearm in question at the time of his arrest, which removed him from the ambit of &sect; 9712.1. The court disagreed and held that the trial court properly sentenced defendant to the mandatory minimum sentence of five years of imprisonment pursuant to &sect; 9712.1 since he was convicted of delivery of marijuana, in violation of 35 Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was admitted to the hospital pursuant to 50 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7302 due to severe depression and a failed attempt at suicide. He had stated at the time that he put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger but no bullet came out. After his permit application for a hunting rifle was denied by the PSP, the applicant sought to have his mental health record expunged and his firearm rights restored pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 6111.1(g)(2) and 6105(f)(1). At a hearing, the applicant denied putting the gun to his head. The trial court denied relief. On appeal, the court found that the record supported the trial court's determination that the applicant had been involuntarily committed, such that he was prohibited from possessing a firearm under &sect; 6105(c)(4). The fact that the commitment was not initiated by a licensed psychiatrist did not render it invalid or inappropriate. Denial of the applicant's petition to have his firearm rights reinstated was also warranted, as the applicant posed a risk to himself. The applicant's constitutionality challenges to &sect; 6105(c)(4) were waived but in any event, they lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), sentencing him to 16 to 32 years incarceration after convictions for conspiracy to commit murder, aggravated assault, conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person, possession of an instrument of crime (PIC), possession of marijuana, and persons not to possess a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Related to a shooting incident, the jury returned not guilty verdicts on counts charging defendant with attempted murder, PIC, and two firearms violations. The jury appeared to have concluded that the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the actual shooter and possessed a gun during the shooting. However, the jury found defendant guilty of PIC in connection with drug related charges. The jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant constructively possessed the loaded firearm in connection with illegal drugs that were found in a home. Furthermore, during sentencing the trial court expressly stated that the Commonwealth proved by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant possessed and used a firearm during the shooting. Thus, it did not err in applying the firearm mandatory and deadly weapon used sentencing enhancements under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9712 and 204 Pa. Code &sect; 303.10(2), where its findings did not mandate an increase in defendant's sentences beyond that which it could have handed down solely based on the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of sentence entered against him by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which sentence him to 10 to 20 years incarceration to be followed by two years probation imposed after his convictions for robbery-threat of serious bodily injury, robbery of a motor vehicle, fleeing and eluding police, terroristic threats, and other crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no error with regard to the admission of the in-court identification of appellant as there was an independent basis from the out-of-court identification that existed so as to allow the victim to identify appellant in court. The court also rejected appellant's contention that his convictions for robbery-threat of serious bodily injury and robbery of a motor vehicle merged for sentencing purposes and that the merger statute,&nbsp;42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9765, was violative of Pennsylvania's prohibition against double jeopardy. The court held that &sect; 9765 did not violate Pennsylvania's prohibition against double jeopardy, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court, having reviewed the federal and state clauses, as well as pertinent Pennsylvania and federal authority, found no evidence to suggest that Article 1, &sect; 10 prohibited the Pennsylvania Legislature from defining merger in a purely elemental fashion. Thus, since the merger statute did not violate double jeopardy and robbery of a motor vehicle and robbery-threat of serious bodily injury were not greater and lesser-included offenses, appellant's claim failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a legally stopped vehicle, and a police officer asked him his name. He provided a false answer. He was arrested on an outstanding warrant. He said the inquiry into his identity was an investigative detention not supported by reasonable suspicion. The appellate court held it was error to suppress his answer because, (1) under the Fourth Amendment, he had no legitimate expectation of privacy in his answers to questions about his identity, and, (2) under the Fifth Amendment, his name could not be used to establish his guilt of the charge related to the outstanding warrant, a truthful answer to the officer's question would not have given rise to the false information charge, so it was not a link in the chain of evidence against defendant as to that charge, and defendant was not compelled to respond to the officer's questions during defendant's mere encounter with the officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a decedent's estate administratrix (EA), sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), which granted a motion by appellee disability residential facility (DRF) for judgment on the pleadings in the EA's wrongful death action, based on the immunity section of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act, 50 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4603.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was a non-verbal 21-year-old woman with mental and physical disabilities who resided at the DRF. She and another resident became ill, and a doctor prescribed medication. However, none was ever administered to the decedent. As the decedent's condition worsened, a licensed practical nurse was called. Despite instructions to the contrary, the DRF staff failed to contact the nurse when the decedent vomited. The decedent's condition continued to worsen and she died from a perforated gastric ulcer. The EA brought suit, and judgment on the pleadings was granted to the DRF based on immunity under the Act. The trial court found that the EA failed to plead or prove that the DRF's actions constituted gross negligence or incompetence. On appeal, the court found that the case should have gone before a jury, as the facts pled in the complaint could have been found to state a claim for gross negligence or incompetence by the DRF. The scope of &sect; 4603 immunity did not just extend to admission and discharge decisions, but rather, it also covered day-to-day care and treatment. A facial challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 4603 was waived, but in any event, it lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), found defendant to be a sexually violent predator (SVP) for the purposes of Megan's Law, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9791-9799.9, and imposed concurrent mandatory minimum 25 to 50 year terms of imprisonment under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9718.2 for each of 29 sexual abuse convictions, pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6312(d)(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally entered into a negotiated guilty plea to violating 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6312(d)(1), and was sentenced to 60 months intermediate punishment, with credit for time served. Just a few months after completing his sentence, defendant was convicted in the instant matter of 29 counts of sexual abuse of children, pursuant to &sect; 6312(d)(1),  and one count of criminal use of a communication facility, pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7512. With regard to his latter conviction, defendant received a concurrent standard range sentence of one to seven years' imprisonment. On appeal, defendant failed to show that error occurred in his SVP designation under Megan's Law. Evidence of defendant's attempts to persuade women in the Philippines to procure children and abuse them at his direction while he watched by web cam was sufficient to sustain the SVP designation, and was sufficient evidence to support the 29 sexual abuse of children convictions. Further, defendant met the diagnostic criteria of pedophilia, where he had recurrent intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent children during a period lasting at least six months.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County (Pennsylvania), following her conviction by a jury on the charges of cruelty to animals, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5511(a)(2.1)(i)(A) and (c)(1), in relation to her attempts to turn three kittens into gothic cats by piercing their ears and necks as well as banding their tails.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the cruelty to animal statute as vague. The court disagreed, finding that the statute was not impermissibly vague on the grounds that the specific acts of maiming, mutilation, torture, and disfigurement were not enumerated. The court noted that criminal laws were not vague simply because the conduct prohibited is described in general language. Further, there were an infinite number of ways in which animals could be dealt with cruelly, thus, it was impossible for the Pennsylvania Legislature to catalog every act which violated the statute. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction as the Commonwealth presented testimony from a doctor that the piercings were inappropriate as they served no function, that the needle used was typically used to inject cattle and was much too large to use on a kitten, the expert's testimony that the piercings would be a constant source of irritation to the animals and that the banding was extremely painful to the kittens, as well evidence that the kittens were maimed, disfigured, and tortured.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother appealed (first appeal) an order granting appellee child services agency's (CSA) motion to permit psychotropic medication for a child in a dependency proceeding (first order), and an order cancelling an appointment the mother had made for the child to begin therapy (second appeal). The appeals were consolidated. The Pennsylvania Orphan's Court terminated the mother's parental rights. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CSA moved to dismiss the first appeal. The appellate court denied the motion to dismiss the first appeal. The second appeal was moot. The first order was appealable under collateral order doctrine under Pa.R.A.P. 313. The child's mental health treatment was collateral to the principal issue in the dependency proceedings. The mother's right to the first appeal was too important to be denied review. The mother's request to prevent the treatment might be irreparably lost if review was postponed until final judgment was entered on the dependency petition. The court had authority to enter the first order under the Pennsylvania Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6339(b). The Pennsylvania Mental Health Procedures Act, 50 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7101 et seq. and the Pennsylvania Drug and Alcohol Abuse Control Act, 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1690.112a, did not apply. The 55 Pa. Code &sect; 3130.91 procedures were followed. The conclusion that it was in the child's best interest to try psychotropic medication for an ADHD condition was supported. The order was not unconstitutionally vague, overbroad, or ambiguous, and was sufficiently flexible to permit the psychiatrist to make the mental health determinations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss the first appeal was denied. The first order was affirmed. The second appeal was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, executor of decedent's estate (estate) sought review of the grant by the Court of Common Pleas, Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) of appellee company's motion for summary judgment. The estate argued that 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5536 did not apply in a latent-disease case and that if it did apply, the exception in &sect; 5536(b)(2) applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate argued that during his employment, decedent was exposed to and inhaled asbestos dust and asbestos fibers, and that as a result, he was diagnosed with mesothelioma. The company requested dismissal based upon the protection of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5536, a statute of repose. The trial court granted that motion. The appellate court held that since the estate did not raise the issue of whether &sect; 5536 applied in a latent disease case during summary judgment, the issue was waived. The appellate court concluded that &sect; 5536(b)(2) did not apply since the company did not qualify as an &quot;owner, tenant or otherwise&quot; subject to the exception. The company was entitled to the protections of &sect; 5536 based upon its design and construction of the finished product, the turbine itself. The estate offered no evidence that the company designed, manufactured, or supplied any of the component parts that the estate contended contributed to decedent's disease. The estate could point to no evidence in the record to suggest that the company played no role in the design and construction of the turbines at issue. The company was within the class of entities intended to be protected by &sect; 5536.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the borrowers defaulted on commercial loans, which were personally guaranteed and secured by property, the bank filed confession of judgment complaints, seeking money judgments. The bank then filed separate mortgage foreclosure complaints against the borrowers, which resulted in judgments. The property was eventually sold at a sheriff's sale to the bank. Thereafter, the bank requested, within the confession of judgment actions, to fix fair market value and deficiency judgments pursuant to the Deficiency Judgment Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8103. The borrowers sought to have the judgments in the foreclosure actions marked satisfied under &sect; 8103(d). The trial court consolidated the actions and entered judgment in favor of the borrowers with respect to the satisfaction petitions. On appeal, the court found that the bank was required to file its petitions to fix fair market value and for deficiency judgment in the foreclosure proceedings pursuant to &sect; 8103(a) and (g). Moreover, such was a mandatory requirement, such that the trial court properly denied the bank's motion to transfer the deficiency request into the foreclosure proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A court granted reargument after it affirmed a trial court's judgment of sentence, which convicted defendant of robbery, aggravated assault of a police officer, and possession of an instrument of crime, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3701(a)(1)(ii), 2702(a)(3), and 907(a). The trial court had denied defendant's suppression motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attempted to rob a convenience store cashier at gunpoint and threatened to kill her. When her manager appeared, defendant ran away. A police officer who had observed defendant's suspicious behavior followed, and stopped, defendant's vehicle. When police tried to arrest defendant, he fled and struggled with the officers, but was eventually subdued. A black handgun was observed on the floor of the vehicle, although it was actually a toy gun. Defendant's suppression motion with respect to the toy gun and clothing seized from the vehicle was denied. He was convicted by a jury and thereafter sentenced. An initial appeal resulted in an affirmance. Upon granting reargument, the same decision was reached. As the officer had reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot, stopping the vehicle and then detaining defendant was proper under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Seizure of the toy gun and clothing from the vehicle was proper under the plain view doctrine, as the officer had a lawful right of access thereto. The weight and sufficiency of the evidence supported the convictions. The cashier's one-on-one identification of defendant was reliable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant asserted that his sentence was illegal because the sentencing statute at issue, namely the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) statute,&nbsp;75 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 3806, violated his constitutional rights to equal protection and fundamental liberty by disparately treating him differently from other defendants who committed a DUI, accepted ARD for that offense, committed a subsequent DUI, withdrew or had ARD revoked, and received a sentence for the subsequent DUI as a second offense. Appellant contended that he suffered a more severe punishment than those defendants who were sentenced for multiple DUI offenses simultaneously. The court disagreed and held that &sect; 3806 did not violate appellant's constitutional rights to equal protection. The court held that the sentencing classification was subject to a rational basis analysis and that &sect; 3806(b) was rationally related to several legitimate government interests of protecting the public and did not violate appellant's right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pled guilty to violations of the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act, the Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, sentenced him to one to two years of imprisonment, followed by three years of reporting probation. Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a condition of probation and/or parole, the trial court authorized random searches of defendant's residence. He argued that such suspicionless searches violated both U.S. Const. amend. IV and Pa. Const., art. I, &sect; 8 and were beyond the authority of the trial court. In order to be valid, he argued, searches of his residence while he was on probation had to be based on a minimal level of reasonable suspicion. The appellate court agreed. The probation condition had no basis in statutory authority or other legal authority and violated former 61 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 331.27b(d)(2) (current version at 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9912(d)), which was in effect at the time of sentencing and required probation officers to support their searches with reasonable suspicion. In permitting suspicionless searches, the trial court exceeded its scope of authority; therefore, the condition was illegal. As the maximum term of defendant's sentence exceeded two years, pursuant to former 61 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 331.26, the trial court lacked authority to set the terms of parole; therefore, its order authorizing random searches of defendant's residence while he was on parole was a legal nullity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas, Lawrence County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which denied his motion under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6322 to decertify criminal proceedings and transfer his matter to the juvenile division. Appellant was charged with homicide and homicide of an unborn child, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2501 and 2603.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was 11 years old at the time, allegedly fired a single gunshot to the back of his father's fiance's head, killing her and her unborn child. Appellant was charged, and he sought a transfer of his case to the juvenile division pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6322(a). A psychologist who tested appellant opined that he was amenable to treatment in the juvenile system, and an expert for the Commonwealth had a differing opinion. Appellant claimed his innocence to both experts. The trial court denied the transfer upon finding that due to appellant's denial of responsibility for his actions, he was not amenable to treatment. However, it clarified that he did not have to confess in order to be rehabilitated. On appeal, the court found that U.S. Const. amend. V was applicable to decertification proceedings. Further, the trial court's application of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6355(a)(4)(iii)(G) and (G)(vii) violated, or at least needlessly chilled, appellant's rights against self-incrimination. The court found that the trial court's clarification was contrary to its statutory application. Immunity under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6338(c)(1) was not adequate to protect appellant's rights under amend. V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court order and remanded the matter for a new decertification hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the legality of the traffic stop of his vehicle. The appeals court found that traffic stops based on a reasonable suspicion either of criminal activity or a violation of the Motor Vehicle Code under the authority of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6308 had to serve a stated investigatory purpose. Defendant claimed that the suppression court erred in denying his motion to suppress challenging the basis of the traffic stop. Based on the record of the suppression hearing, the appeals court concluded that the trooper was able to articulate specific facts possessed by her at the time of the questioned stop that provided probable cause to believe defendant was in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3309(1). The suppression court viewed a video recording from the trooper's patrol car and observed numerous touchings of the white fog line by defendant's vehicle and clearly saw the vehicle cross over the center yellow line while negotiating a curve. Given the presence of oncoming traffic, defendant's deviations from his lane of travel created a significant safety hazard. The traffic stop of defendant vehicle was legal. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 6105, 6108, and 6110.2 of the Uniform Firearms Act, and of possession of a controlled substance in violation of 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 780-113(a)(16). The Philadelphia Gun Court of the Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, authorized random, warrantless searches as a condition of probation and parole. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that under former 61 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 331.27b(d)(2) (current version at 42 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9912), a probation officer could conduct a property search only on reasonable suspicion that the premises contained evidence of violations of the conditions of supervision. The appellate court held that &sect; 331.27b, by its plain terms, applied only to searches made by probation officers acting on their own authority without judicial sanction. The trial court had the authority under &sect; 9754(b) (42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9754(b)) of the Pennsylvania Sentencing Code to authorize random, warrantless searches of defendant's residence for weapons as a condition of probation, as this condition was reasonably related to his rehabilitation and public safety. The condition did not violate the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 did not provide greater protection than the Fourth Amendment in that regard. However, as defendant was sentenced to two or more years in prison, his parole would be under the exclusive supervision of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation; therefore, the trial court did not have the authority to impose the condition on his parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the condition as it applied to the probationary sentence, but vacated it with respect to the state parole aspect of the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The committed person killed his wife and unborn child, stabbed his grandmother with a butcher knife, and gouged out the eye of his five year-old daughter. He was found not criminally responsible for the crimes charged. He was involuntarily committed for one year pursuant to &sect; 7304 of the MHPA. He was recommitted each subsequent year. He asserted that he was initially confined due to his history of mental illness but his current mental status warranted no further commitment because the mental illness was not continuing. The appellate court held the MHPA included the elements required by the United States Supreme Court and, therefore, could not be deemed unconstitutional. The MHPA provided for adequate protection against outdated determinations and comported with the due process requirements as civil commitment and recommitment under the MHPA required both a current mental disability and a determination of dangerousness. Accordingly, the MHPA was consistent with the dictates of Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71 (1992), and the constitutionality challenge failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after being found in possession of catha edulis (khat).

An expert analyzed the khat and concluded that it contained cathinone, a Schedule I controlled substance. Defendant argued that as khat was not mentioned in 28 Pa. Code &sect; 25.72(b)(6)(xxxvi), which listed cathinone as a Schedule I controlled substance, his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV were violated because he did not have fair warning that his conduct was illegal. The appellate court disagreed. Someone of ordinary intelligence could read &sect; 25.72(b)(6)(xxxvi) and understand that possession of material containing cathinone was unlawful. Since the prosecution had to prove that defendant knew that the khat he possessed contained a controlled substance, Pennsylvania's Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 780-101 - 780-141, as applied to him, did not violate due process fair warning requirements. As the evidence established that defendant knew he was in possession of an illegal substance, the evidence was sufficient to convict him.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that Senate Bill 92 of the 2003 Session of the Pennsylvania Legislature, by which the Megan's Law provisions, set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9791-9799.9, were enacted, violated the single subject rule. However, the offending provisions were capable of severance because the centerpiece of Senate Bill 92 was the Megan's Law provisions. The bill began and concluded with Megan's Law, and Megan's Law supplied the vast majority of the bill's provisions. Moreover, in consideration of 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1925, the disparate provisions of Megan's Law and the Deficiency Judgment Act, as well as the sundry other minor matters contained in Senate Bill 92, were not essentially and inseparably connected, and the Megan's Law provisions, standing alone, were complete and capable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent. Thus, Megan's Law was sustained in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which convicted him for persons not to carry firearms (18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6105); carrying a firearm without a license (18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6106); carrying a firearm on public streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6108); and carrying a firearm with an obliterated serial number (18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6117).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court imposed an aggregate term of six to 12 years of incarceration followed by five years of probation. Appellant's convictions arose from a police radio call with flash information describing robbery suspects and responding officers going to the location and finding appellant and others who matched that information. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied appellant's motion to suppress the gun that he discarded while the police were chasing him on foot because he had fled and retrieved the gun in defiance of an officer's order to stop. Thus, even though the initial pursuit of appellant was not lawful, retrieving the gun gave the officer probable cause to arrest appellant. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence the information police received over the radio flash report. However, the court did find that insufficient evidence existed to support appellant's conviction under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6117 since there was no evidence that he had obliterated the serial number on the gun. The court further held that the convictions under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6105 and 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6106 did not merge for sentencing purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of sentence, in part, imposed for appellant's conviction for obliteration the serial number of a gun, and affirmed the remainder of the judgment of sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of sentence imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania). The court granted en banc review to address suppression and sentencing issues raised by appellant. Appellant was found guilty of possessing a firearm (18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6105), carrying a firearm without a license (18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6106), and carrying a firearm on a public street (18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6108).</SPAN></P>

No further penalty was imposed for his violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6108. Appellant's convictions arose from officers on patrol observing a possible drug transaction. A stolen gun fell from appellant's waist area. The court held that the trial judge properly refused to suppress the evidence, though on slightly different grounds. Specifically, the court held that appellant's partial failure to comply with Pa. R. Crim. P. 581(D) resulted in the imposition of a lesser burden on the Commonwealth, which was met. The court found that appellant's suppression motion failed to state with particularity the evidence sought to be suppressed, among other deficiencies. Most significantly, appellant's motion claimed that his arrest was illegal because of a lack of probable cause, but the motion did not assert as a ground for suppression the manner of the seizure of the physical evidence, only that the seizure was not warranted in the first place. The court also held that the sentences were not appropriate for merger.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the sentence imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County (Pennsylvania) after he was convicted of shooting on or across highways in violation of 34 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2504(a). The trial court sentenced defendant to pay a fine of $ 200 and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was hunting deer. According to defendant, after parking by the side of a road, he crossed a ditch and took up a position by a large tree that was 18 feet from the edge of the road. After waiting for about 45 minutes, he saw a deer cross the road. He then aimed away from the road and shot the deer while the deer was about 35 feet &quot;into the woods.&quot; One of his neighbors reported the shooting. The appellate court held the record indicated that defendant was not engaged in the conduct that &sect; 2504 was designed to protect against. As the trial court did not find Commonwealth witness to be credible, it discounted his testimony that defendant was on the roadway when he shot the deer. Further, the evidence showed that defendant had alighted from his vehicle some 45 minutes before shooting the deer. In addition, the evidence showed that defendant shot the deer while it was on the same side of the road as where he was standing. Thus, his conduct did not constitute road hunting, and did not endanger any user of the highway, as &sect; 2504 required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of sentence was vacated. Defendant was discharged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, sought review of an order of the County Court of Common Pleas of Berks County (Pennsylvania) which suppressed the results of a blood alcohol (BAC) test performed on defendant at a hospital following a motor vehicle accident. A panel of the Superior Court affirmed. The Commonwealth requested en banc reargument, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth charged defendant with, inter alia, four counts of driving under influence of alcohol or controlled substance (DUI). Defendant filed a suppression motion claiming no one had asked him to consent to blood testing, he did not provide consent, the search warrant was overbroad, and the Commonwealth lacked any probable cause to support its request for BAC test results. The trial court concluded that the record lacked any mention as to any reason for defendant's blood being drawn. Therefore, it granted the suppression motion with respect to the BAC results obtained pursuant to the search warrant. The appellate court held there was no evidence to suggest the blood draw had been taken for any reason other than independent medical purposes. Absent more, the Commonwealth had no obligation to prove the sample was taken for independent medical purposes. The police obtained a valid warrant for the results of defendant's blood test. Because the blood draw was conducted for independent medical purposes, and an officer obtained the results of this blood draw after applying for and executing a valid search warrant, the court should not have suppressed the BAC test results.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property tenant sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas, Lancaster County, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), which granted summary judgment to appellee paving subcontractor (PSC) in its action on its mechanics' lien under the Pennsylvania Mechanics' Lien Law, 49 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1101 et seq. The trial court awarded the PSC pre-judgment interest (PJI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the start of the construction project, the tenant filed a stipulation against liens (SAL) in the county prothonotary's office. The PSC was hired to perform asphalt paving work in a bank construction project. Although the subcontractor that hired it was paid most of its proceeds, it failed to pay the PSC. The PSC accordingly filed its mechanics' lien and subsequently filed suit. A request for a bond to discharge the lien was granted. It was determined that the matter could be decided on cross-motions for summary judgment, and the necessary papers were filed. The trial court granted summary judgment to the PSC and awarded it PJI at the statutory rate. On appeal, the court found that the SAL was not binding, as the contract was entered into after amendments to the Law went into effect. Such was based on statutory construction rules under 1 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1921 and 1926. PJI was error, as interest should have only been awarded from the date of judgment under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8101. The trial court correctly determined that the PSC was entitled to interest at the statutory rate under 41 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 201.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the trial court, and it remanded the matter for modification of the judgment in order to remove the PJI award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appealed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Columbia/Montour County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee inmates' requests for a writ of habeas corpus and dismissed the criminal charges against them. They were convicted of violating 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5513(a)(2), (3) and (4), relating to unlawful gambling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover police officer participated in games of Texas Hold 'Em Poker (THEP) in a garage under the inmates' control. He noted that players paid money to participate, and that the winner tipped the dealer. The inmates were charged with multiple counts related to unlawful gambling and they filed an omnibus pretrial motion, including relief in the nature of habeas corpus. The trial court determined that skill predominated over chance in the game, such that THEP was held not to be within the unlawful gambling of &sect; 5513. Accordingly, the trial court granted the inmates' motion and dismissed the charges. On appeal by the Commonwealth, the court held that while the outcome of poker was dependent on skill to some degree, it was predominantly a game of chance pursuant to analysis under the predominate-factors test. Accordingly, it constituted gambling. Further, it constituted &quot;unlawful gambling&quot; because it was not authorized by the legislature. The court found that dismissal of the charges was error, as the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case against the inmates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of unauthorized transfer of sounds on recording devices (UT) and trademark counterfeiting (TC), in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 4116 and 4119. The trial court had denied defendant's suppression motion with respect to evidence obtained from a traffic stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle was stopped due to a malfunctioning center brake light. As the officers approached the vehicle, they observed an open bag on the back seat containing over 200 compact discs and digital video discs, some of which were duplicates. The officers recognized the discs as contraband. Defendant was ticketed for the broken brake light, the bag of contraband was seized, and defendant was arrested. Defendant's suppression motion was denied, after which he waived his jury trial right and the trial court convicted him as charged. On appeal, the court found no reason to disturb the suppression ruling. Although defendant's side brake lights were working, his center brake light was not. That constituted vehicle equipment that was not ornamental, such that the officers had reasonable suspicion of a Motor Vehicle Code violation pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 4303 and 67 Pa. Code &sect;&sect; 153.4 and 175.66. Accordingly, the traffic stop was justified. The UT conviction was merged into the TC conviction for sentencing purposes. However, the TC offense had been declared unconstitutionally overbroad. Accordingly, the court sua sponte held that the conviction and sentence thereon were illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment with respect to the conviction for UT, but it reversed the conviction for TC, vacated the judgment of sentence, and remanded the matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was adjudicated delinquent for indecent assault. He was placed on probation and required to attend counseling sessions. The inmate exhibited a history of non-compliance with his treatment programs. The Sexual Offender Assessment Board determined that he met the criteria for placement pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6403. The court found clear and convincing evidence existed to meet the requirements for inpatient placement under &sect; 6403, based on the inmate's mental abnormality that made it likely that he would engage in sexually aggressive behavior. On appeal, the inmate raised constitutional challenges to the legislation. The court reviewed prior equal protection challenges and found them lacking in merit. The inmate's claim that Act 21 was penal in nature also lacked merit, and the clear and convincing standard of proof comported with due process requirements under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. A substantive due process challenge also failed, as the State's interest was valid. The inmate failed to identify statements that could expose him to future criminal proceedings in violation of his rights under U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees each worked for the employer for over 30 years. More than 10 years after their employment terminated, they each developed mesothelioma and died. Each executrix filed a personal injury action, alleging that the contraction of mesothelioma was due to the employer's negligence. The trial court granted summary judgment to the employer, finding that the claims were barred by provisions in the Workers' Compensation Act (WCA), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 1 et seq., and the Occupational Disease Act (ODA), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 1201 et seq. On appeal, the court analyzed the exclusivity sections and the purposes of the WCA and the ODA and noted that mesothelioma was an occupational disease thereunder pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect;&sect; 481 and 1403. It held that given the wording of the exclusive remedy provisions, the WCA and ODA were the exclusive vehicles for compensation for loss. Due to the time limitations under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect;&sect; 411(2) and 1401(c), any recovery was barred. Further, there was no violation of due process under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County (Pennsylvania) which granted her divorce from appellee husband. The trial court dismissed all economic claims against the husband, determining that it had jurisdiction to dissolve the parties' marriage but lacked the necessary personal jurisdiction over the husband to adjudicate related economic claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife filed a divorce complaint in Pennsylvania. She set forth economic claims for equitable distribution, counsel fees, expenses, spousal support, alimony pendente lite, alimony, and permanent alimony. The trial court granted the husband's preliminary objections, in part, and dismissed the economic claims. The appellate court held that since the wife moved to Pennsylvania seven months before initiating divorce proceedings, she satisfied the residency requirement. In order to resolve the ancillary economic claims, however, the trial court required personal jurisdiction over the husband. The husband did not reside in Pennsylvania, he did not work in Pennsylvania, and the last marital domicile was Wisconsin. As to the wife's contention that the record revealed the requisite minimum contacts to establish personal jurisdiction over the husband, the appellate court did not agree. The husband was not served in Pennsylvania, he had not consented to the jurisdiction of the court, and the requisite minimum contacts under the long-arm statute did not exist. Thus, the exercise of personal jurisdiction over him would have violated both the Pennsylvania Long-Arm Statute and due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At appellant's hearing on his pre-trial motion to suppress, the Commonwealth presented testimony from an alleged co-conspirator, who was incarcerated in state prison, by use of a two-way videoconferencing system. During the hearing, Appellant objected because the witness was not present in the courtroom to testify. He renewed his objection when the witness was allowed to identify appellant. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had remanded the case to the court for it to determine the propriety of the trial court allowing the videoconferencing of the co-conspirator. The court held that the use of the two-way video system violated appellant's Confrontation Clause, U.S. Const. amend. VI, rights. Further, while the suppression court did allow defense counsel to argue objections regarding the use of video testimony, no hearing was held on the matter and no case-specific findings were made regarding the necessity of videoconferencing in the case. However, the court found the error harmless the co-conspirator's testimony was cumulative of an officer's testimony.</SPAN></P>

The employer asserted that the claims were barred by the exclusivity provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act (WCA), 77 Pa.C.S. &sect; 481(a), and the Occupational Disease Act (ODA), 77 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1208.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased employee died from a brain tumor, and her husband filed suit. He alleged that the decedent's exposure to vinyl chloride while working for the employer caused the tumor.

On appeal, the court disagreed with the trial court. It held that the statutory bars under &sect;&sect; 481(a) and 1208 precluded the spouse's claims. The spouse did not plead sufficient facts to support a claim of fraud by the employer, as there was no showing of flagrant misconduct or intentional misleading of the decedent by the employer. Although the injury suffered by the decedent was within the definition of an occupational disease under the ODA, it was barred by the time limitation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had held that the commissions were barred by judicial precedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A testatrix established a testamentary trust under her will, which provided that the residue of her estate and certain property over which she exercised powers of appointment was to be held in trust. The ST became the corporate successor to the originally appointed executor of the estate and trustee of the will. Upon filing an accounting under the trust for a period that was more than 25 years in length, the ST sought commissions from principal for its services. Objections to that request were based on the prior trustee's acceptance of a fee for its executor services. The trial court denied the compensation request, finding that it was barred by a controlling judicial precedent. On appeal, the court reviewed the history of legislation and case law in that regard and determined that the precedent was no longer controlling. Moreover, the legislature's clear intent was to no longer bar dual compensation requests. The trial court accordingly erred by substituting its summary conclusion for constitutional analysis. Certain issues were not reviewed under Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) where they were not previously raised in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a private criminal complaint in which he alleged that the detective who investigated his criminal case had violated certain statutes by intentionally destroying or intentionally altering recordings. An assistant DA determined that a small portion of the recordings had been inadvertently taped over by the detective but that there was no evidence that he acted with any criminal intent in doing so. Based on the detective's lack of criminal intent, the DA determined that the complaint lacked legal merit. The court stated that because the DA concluded that the complaint lacked legal merit, the conclusion was subject to de novo review. To say that the DA had a policy of not accepting complaints that lacked legal merit did not transform the rejection of the complaint into a public policy decision or a hybrid of legal and public policy reasons, reviewable under an abuse of discretion standard. Here, despite the trial court's reference to the DA's discretion, it had properly determined, based upon its de novo consideration of the record, that there was no legal merit to appellant's complaint. There was no evidence of criminal intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the children were adjudicated dependant in Nevada and their parents failed to comply with their family service plans, the children were placed with the grandmother in Pennsylvania. However, during the course of its investigation to qualify the grandmother as a foster parent, the Department of Human Services discovered that the step-grandfather had a 12-year-old conviction for aggravated assault. Accordingly, the grandmother was disqualified as a foster parent pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6344. The children were subsequently moved to the home of a maternal cousin. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the grandmother did not fall into any of the categories in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6336.1 that would grant her status as a party in the children's dependency hearing. Her care and control of the children were not at issue in the case and she did not have legal custody of the children. Therefore, the trial court did not err in ruling that the grandmother did not have standing in the dependency proceeding. Because the grandmother was never found to be a &quot;party&quot; to the dependency proceedings, she was never entitled to court-appointed counsel under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6337.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold cocaine to a confidential informant, who entered his residence on various occasions to buy the drugs while police officers waited outside. The Commonwealth argued that the trial court imposed an illegal sentence by declining to impose the statutorily required mandatory minimum term. The superior court held that the trial court's concern with whether the drug transactions were effected in close proximity to firearms was legally irrelevant because the weapons were loaded and readily accessible to defendant and found in the same room as the drugs. An officer testified that he recovered drugs and handguns in plain view in the back bedroom of defendant's residence. He described the weapons as: one black Hulk 0.357 Magnum handgun that was found to be loaded with six-live rounds, one 0.9 millimeter found to be loaded with six-live-rounds, one 12-gauge shotgun that was loaded with four rounds, and one 20-gauge sawed-off shotgun that was loaded with one round.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2007, defendant pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property and was sentenced to a period of incarceration of 21 to 72 months. No appeal was filed. In his habeas corpus petition, defendant claimed, inter alia, that the courts lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him due to defects in the drafting/adoption of the constitution, and/or enactment of the Crimes Code, and that the court rules were promulgated/drafted/adopted/legislated in violation of Pa. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4. The appellate court found that defendant's allegations of constitutional defects equated to a contention constituting an attack upon the court's authority, i.e., its jurisdiction. Therefore, it could have been addressed by the PCRA court. Defendant's application for a writ of habeas corpus appeared to be nothing more than a tactical choice to evade the timeliness requirements of the PCRA. Accordingly, he was not entitled to habeas corpus relief. However, since it was defendant's first collateral attack upon his convictions and judgment of sentence, he was entitled to the appointment of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was vacated, and the case was remanded for the appointment of counsel pursuant to proper post-conviction relief proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated indecent assault. He lived on the streets after was released from prison. He was arrested for not registering his residence under the Law. The trial court found that he did not violate the Law because he did not have a residence to register. The Commonwealth argued that the definition of &quot;residence&quot; in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9792 was designed to encompass transient and homeless persons, The superior court held that because defendant's homeless existence precluded the possibility of a residence or fixed place of habitation or abode, he was without a residence to register, change, or verify within the meaning of the Law. The legislature could have drafted the Law registration requirement to require a homeless and transient person to register, but it did not. The statutory definition in &sect; 9792 contemplated a physical &quot;location&quot; of some degree of permanence, something akin to a traditional residence but not a locale of one day's duration or a mere mailing address. The definition, by equating a residence to a location of &quot;30 consecutive days or more,&quot; recognized that some degree of permanence was necessary to transform a place of habitat into a residence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of sentence imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) following his convictions for terroristic threats and ethnic intimidation in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2706(a) and 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2710(a). He argued that the Commonwealth failed to adduce sufficient evidence to support his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for terroristic threats. The evidence demonstrated defendant's culpability under the &quot;reckless disregard&quot; standard of &sect; 2706(a)(3). Defendant approached the victim on two occasions. The first time defendant was time revving a drill, and the second time he was wielding a hammer. On the second occasion, the victim expected defendant to strike her and raised her hand to prevent the fall of the hammer. Defendant's conduct in wielding the hammer, even if not specifically intended to place the victim in terror, could and did violate the victim's sense of personal security. The superior court concluded that the record did not establish the malicious intention required for a conviction of ethnic intimidation. The record failed to show that the victim's ethnicity was the primary basis for defendant's behavior. Although defendant's anger did not justify his use of ethnically derogatory terms, it suggested that his commission of the predicate offense, terroristic threats, upon which his ethnic intimidation conviction depended, was driven principally by factors other than the victim's ethnicity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court affirmed the judgment of sentence as it applied to defendant's conviction of terroristic threats but reversed the judgment of sentence as it applied to his conviction of ethnic intimidation.</SPAN></P>

The claims stemmed from the death of the decedent in a single-vehicle accident while driving a pickup truck manufactured by the car manufacturer and involving the deployment of the truck's air bag. The estate representative appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate representative filed a strict liability action against the car manufacturer after decedent's pickup truck struck a dirt embankment. Decedent was found dead in the truck. The truck's air bag had deployed. Decedent was not wearing a seat belt. The estate representative's contention was that the air bag should not have deployed at all or deployed too late; the car manufacturer argued that the air bag system was not defective and deployed precisely as designed. The jury returned a verdict for the car manufacturer. The appellate court found that (1) trial court should not have allowed evidence that decedent had not used a seat belt, admitted on the issue of causation, as 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 4581(e) barred the admission of such evidence for any purpose; (2) the trial court should not have allowed testimony about why decedent was out of position in the truck prior to the impact; and (3) since the erroneously admitted evidence prejudiced the estate representative because it took the focus off of the product and placed it on decedent's conduct, an inappropriate consideration in a products liability case, the estate representative was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator of a decedent's estate filed a petition requesting appellant former wife of the decedent to show cause why she should not relinquish all of the proceeds of the decedent's life insurance policy to the nephew of the decedent. The Court of Common Pleas of York County, Orphans (Pennsylvania), denied the former wife's motion to dismiss and directed her to surrender the insurance proceeds to the nephew. The former wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent and the former wife divorced over four years before the decedent's death. However, he had not changed the designation of the former wife as a beneficiary to the life insurance. There was no dispute that the insurance policy was part of an employee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1001 et seq. The former wife argued ERISA preempted 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6111.2. The appellate court disagreed. 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6111.2 ensured that Pennsylvania's re-designation statute had no impact on ERISA plan administrators. Plan documents continued to control the administration, and the objective of a national uniform administrative format was maintained. Because of the expansive nature of the immunization, the Pennsylvania statute had no effect on the administration of ERISA plans. Therefore, 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6111.2 was not preempted by ERISA. There was no need for preemption by ERISA because there was no conflict between ERISA and state law. 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6111.2 established a basis for resolution of disputes between claimants which did not impact on plan administrators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police responded to a domestic violence call. Although the responding officer was informed that defendant had surrendered, the officer decided to search his residence for a weapon used.

The mother consented and informed the officer that he would find anything on the third floor, where defendant resided. Police found heroin, weapons, and other incriminating evidence. Defendant was then charged. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress. The appellate court found that the mother did not have actual authority to consent to a search of defendant's room because defendant had established exclusive authority over possession of the third floor. However, it found that the officer's search was permitted under an apparent authority exception to the warrant requirement based on the officer's reasonable belief that she had apparent authority to consent. It so concluded after finding that exception was not inconsistent with Pa. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which sentenced him to a nine to twenty year term of imprisonment for rape, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3121(a)(1) and (2), a consecutive three to ten year term for statutory sexual assault, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3122.1, and a consecutive two to four year term for corruption of minors, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6301.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the crimes of rape and statutory sexual assault should have been merged for purposes of sentencing because a single incident of sexual intercourse between him and the victim proved both crimes. The Commonwealth admitted that defendant's convictions arose from a single set of facts but argued that merger was unnecessary. The superior court held that the merger of defendant's sentences for the crimes of rape and statutory sexual assault was not required. Each crime had an additional element not included in the other. Rape required proof of forcible compulsion or the threat thereof. Statutory sexual assault required proof that the complainant was under sixteen years of age, that the perpetrator was at least four years older than the complainant, and that the complainant and the perpetrator were not married. Because there were distinct elements that supported the crimes of rape and statutory sexual assault, the crimes were not greater and lesser included offenses and merger was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the decedent's ex-wife, filed objections in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), Orphans' Court Division, to appellant executor's proposed accounting. The court ruled that the estate was liable for child support payments, was not entitled to use Social Security benefits as a credit, was not obligated to contribute to college expenses, and was obligated to cover certain medical expenses. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's ex-wife alleged that the decedent's estate was bound by the terms of a marital dissolution agreement (MDA) to provide child support and cover other expenses on behalf of the decedent's minor children. The executor disputed those obligations and noted that the children began receiving monthly Social Security benefits after the decedent's death. The executor argued that the estate was entitled to use the Social Security payments as a credit against the child support obligation. On appeal, the court found that (1) the trial court did not commit an error of law in enforcing the child support provision of the MDA against the estate; (2) the trial court erred in declining to allow the estate to credit the Social Security benefits against the support obligation, and, because the Social Security benefits exceeded the support obligation, no money was due under the MDA; and (3) the trial court did not err in ordering the estate to reimburse certain of the minor children's medical expenses pursuant to the terms of the MDA. Additionally, the MDA did not bind the estate to contribute to the children's college expenses, and the ex-wife was not entitled to counsel fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order directing the estate to pay child support pursuant to the marital dissolution agreement was vacated, the order directing the estate to reimburse certain medical expenses pursuant to the marital dissolution agreement was affirmed, the award of prejudgment interest was vacated, and the denial of counsel fees was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent contracted mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos products, which were manufactured by the manufacturers. The estate contended that the decedent inhaled fibers from the executor's clothes and was also exposed to asbestos when the executor and decedent conducted home repairs. However, they admitted that the decedent smoked approximately one pack of cigarettes per day. They also admitted that it was unclear whether the decedent was exposed to asbestos from one of the manufacturer's products. They attached two exhibits indicating that the executor had used the products. The appellate court held that even assuming the material used by the executor contained asbestos, the estate did not present a genuine issue of material fact as to causation. In consideration of the frequency, regularity, and proximity test, it was clear that the decedent was, at most, casually or minimally exposed to the manufacturer's product. While there was no doubt she was exposed to asbestos sometime during her lifetime, and that exposure caused her illness, the estate had not presented evidence that linked her asbestos exposure to the manufacturers.</SPAN></P>

However, the engineer did not provide evidence as to whether he used the product before or after the asbestos was eliminated; therefore, the evidence did not present a genuine issue of material fact that he was exposed to asbestos when he used the product. His deposition did not create a genuine fact issue as to whether he inhaled asbestos fibers from another manufacturer's product while he worked at a shipyard. No evidence was presented that the product was used on a ship or in the vicinity where he worked.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant executors challenged orders of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which granted summary judgment to appellee manufacturer in their actions to recover damages for the deaths of individuals who died of asbestos related mesothelioma. The trial court found that 15 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1929.1 (2001) insulated the manufacturer from liability. The executors argued that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer was based in Pennsylvania and made bottle-caps and cans. It purchased a corporation, which operated a division that manufactured asbestos products. The manufacturer never operated that division, and within 90 days of acquiring the corporation, it sold the asbestos-related division. The manufacturer paid hundreds of millions of dollars in asbestos-related claims. The value of those claims far exceeded the fair market value of the corporation. Under the plain language of the statute, the manufacturer was not liable for the executors' claims because it had already paid out asbestos liabilities exceeding the fair market value of a corporation. The superior court held that the executors lacked standing to raise their challenges to the statute. The executors failed to demonstrate that they had a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in a challenge to the enactment of the statute. They failed to show how any alleged violation of the dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3, had a tangible effect on their interests. The executors could recover all of their damages from the remaining defendants through settlement or otherwise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the grandmother of appellant minor, sought to have the minor committed for involuntary drug and/or alcohol treatment under 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1690.112a (Act 53). The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) ordered the minor committed. The minor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the minor's argument that he was denied due process and the right to counsel when, based solely on the petition, he was detained and subjected to an assessment in which he was compelled to divulge private information. Act 53 served a purpose similar to the Mental Health Procedures Act (MPHA), 50 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7101-7503. Just as the MPHA survived constitutional scrutiny, so did Act 53. The procedures under Act 53 were fundamentally fair and provided constitutionally adequate protections for minors. Next, it was not a due process violation for the minor to be restrained prior to and during his hearing. The matter did not involve a jury but a judge, and there was no reason to believe that his initial observation of the minor in restraints rendered him incapable of adjudicating the matter fairly. Furthermore, as the trial court had expressed its concern that the minor was a flight risk, the restraints were justified by the trial court's need to keep the minor in the courtroom and thereby maintain order. Finally, the minor had not shown that the restraints impeded his ability to communicate with his counsel and thereby infringed his right to counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order involuntarily committing the minor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of defendant's motion to suppress statements and a grant of the Commonwealth's request to introduce prior bad act evidence, a jury convicted defendant of aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of children, and simple assault. The Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County (Pennsylvania) sentenced defendant to seven and one half to sixteen years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying her request to suppress statements made to police, as she was interrogated without being given Miranda warnings. The reviewing court disagreed, finding that defendant's interview with police was not a custodial interrogation; among other things, defendant was not transported against her will, defendant was free to leave whenever she chose to, and the interview was not overly lengthy. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in allowing the Commonwealth to play a DVD of a child, on rebuttal, as a prior consistent statement. The reviewing court found no abuse of discretion, noting that the evidence was properly admitted to corroborate the child's testimony after defense counsel's questions insinuated that the child had been induced to fabricate her story by the prosecution and her mother. Finally, defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to merge the sentence for endangering the welfare with that for aggravated assault, as both charges were based on the same factual predicates. While the charges were based on the same facts, merger was not required, as the elements of the offenses differed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania) entered final judgments of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of criminal attempt homicide, recklessly endangering another person, intimidation of witnesses or victims, and related offenses regarding the shooting of an eyewitness to a double murder. Defendant appealed from the judgment of sentence entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of criminal attempt, recklessly endangering another person, intimidation of witnesses or victims, retaliation against a witness or victim, and being a person who is not supposed to possess, use, manufacture, control, or transfer firearms arising out of the shooting of a witness who allegedly saw defendant's brother kill two people. Eventually, the trial court imposed a mix of consecutive and concurrent sentences that resulted in an imposed sentence of 15 to 36 years in prison. The appellate court first found that defendant's challenge to the consecutive sentences imposed attacked the discretionary aspects of his sentence, but failed to present a substantial question regarding the sentence, especially since the trial court had discretion pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9721 to imposed consecutive or concurrent sentences. It then found that defendant's sentence for intimidation of a witness, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 4952, did not violate Apprendi, as defendant admitted that the victim in his case was a witness against defendant's brother on the murder charges against the brother, which meant the jury did not have to make a specific factual finding in that regard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment of sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant stood back and did not say or do anything. The trio then went to an ATM machine and the man forced the victim to punch in the access code numbers on the ATM machine. Once the victim withdrew money, the man took it and fled. Defendant then also fled. After defendant was arrested, he was tried for robbery and other crimes at a bench trial. He was found guilty. Instead of using the sentencing guidelines, the trial court applied a longer mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9712(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), entered a final judgment of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of attempted unlawful contact with a minor. It set aside the jury's verdict finding him guilty of criminal use of a communication facility. It then sentenced defendant regarding the one guilty finding. Defendant appealed and the Commonwealth cross appealed the verdict that was set aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant engaged in instant message and off-line communications with a person whom he believed to be a 12-year-old girl. In fact, he was communicating with an agent of the state attorney general's office. The communications were sexual in nature. Defendant and the &quot;girl&quot; agreed to meet. Defendant drove to the meeting place and upon arrival was arrested. A jury found him guilty of attempted unlawful contact with a minor, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 901, 6318(a)(1), and criminal use of a communication facility, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7512(a). The trial court then set aside the jury's verdict of guilt on the communication facility charge because it found that verdict inconsistent with the verdict on the unlawful contact charge. The appellate court found that (1) he lacked standing to claim that the unlawful contact charge violated the dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 based on the possibility of ensnaring an out-of-state resident because the record showed that he was an in-state resident, (2) inconsistent verdicts were permissible, and (3) the Commonwealth's closing argument was proper and did not warrant granting a mistrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment of sentence in part; however, it also remanded the case to the trial court for (1) it to reimpose the jury's verdict of guilt on the count of criminal use of a communication facility and (2) further sentencing proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A supervisor of the employee allegedly began making sexually offensive comments to her and engaging in sexually offensive conduct towards her.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile adjudicated delinquent for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, appealed from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Wayne County, Civil Division, (Pennsylvania), that directed him to undergo immediate commitment to an involuntary inpatient treatment facility under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6403(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since his adjudication, the juvenile had been placed in a series of treatment centers. He was found to have a mental abnormality or personality disorder which results in serious difficulty in controlling sexually violent behavior that made him likely to engage in an act of sexual violence. The trial court directed the juvenile to file a concise statement of errors complained of on appeal under Pa.R.A.P. 1925. Appellant filed a timely concise statement on the next day, raising the issue that he now raises on appeal. The court applied the exercise of hypothetical jurisdiction, and proceeded to the merits. Analytically, the claim was similar to a &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; evaluation under Megan's Law, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9791 et seq. The presence or absence of one particular technical factor from the DSM did not defeat a finding that the juvenile was subject to Act 21. The examiner found clear evidence that he was not controlling his deviant arousal patterns and was engaging in interpersonal behavior that directly replicated offense behavior, even while placed in treatment. That he had not engaged in deviant behavior while in placement was not significant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of sentence entered in the Court of Common Pleas, Lycoming County, Criminal Division, Pennsylvania following his convictions of third degree murder, possession of an instrument of crime, and tampering with evidence in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2502, 907 and 4910, respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in concluding that he failed to present sufficient evidence to establish his insanity at the time of the offense. The appellate court found that the trial court did not err when it found that defendant failed to establish that he was legally insane at the time he committed the murder because the evidence included divergent diagnoses of defendant's mental state by several specialists over various periods of time. Moreover, lay testimony indicated that defendant took steps to prepare his home in anticipation of the arrival of police and concocted a story to hide the events that transpired, thus indicating defendant knew the nature of the act committed and that it was wrong. The court rejected defendant's claim that the sentencing scheme established by 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 314 and 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9727 violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 because it subjected mentally ill defendants to the same criminal liability and sentences as defendants who were not mentally ill where there was no prohibition in the Constitution against punishment simply because the law in other jurisdictions differed and might have yielded another penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), after his convictions for aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person (REAP), and endangering the welfare of a child (EWOC). Defendant was sentenced to, inter alia, restitution up to a maximum amount of $ 1,481,562.54 on the aggravated assault charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his infant son was in his exclusive control, defendant called 911 because the son was exhibiting unresponsive behavior. The son was diagnosed with shaken baby syndrome and suffered brain damage that significantly impaired his cognition and motor skills. Because the Department of Public Welfare had paid and would continue to pay the child's medical expenses through its medical assistance program, defendant was ordered to pay restitution under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1106. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded as to the restitution order but affirmed as to the balance of the judgment. The trial court's order of restitution violated &sect; 1106(2) because it only set a maximum cap but did not specify any particular amount of restitution or any method of payment. While defendant claimed that he did not possess the requisite level of intent to be convicted of aggravated assault under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2702(a)(1) or REAP under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2705, a heightened degree of recklessness, as defined under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 302(b)(3), was shown by the fact that the son's injuries could have only occurred with a violent shaking. Such a shaking was an obvious risk for serious bodily injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the sentence in part insofar as it pertained to the restitution and remanded for further restitution proceedings. The court affirmed the balance of the sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas, Erie County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which granted a new trial to defendant on grounds that his prosecution under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6111(g)(4) of the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act of 1995, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6101 et seq., regarding the sale or transfer of firearms violated defendant's due process rights as well as the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to purchase a handgun.

Defendant improperly answered &quot;no&quot; to questions as to prior felony convictions and prior commitments to a mental institution; defendant had four prior convictions and had been involuntarily committed on four occasions. The court reversed and remanded. Even though defendant gave false answers as to matters not specifically listed in &sect; 6111(b), his prosecution did not violate due process because the statute was not vague as applied to defendant's particular conduct as 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6105 prohibited certain persons from possessing a firearm, including those with prior felony convictions and those who had been involuntarily committed. Because &sect; 6111(g)(4) was broadly worded, no evidence existed that it was to be read solely in conjunction with &sect; 6111(b)(1); &sect; 6111(g)(4) referred to the entire Firearms Act. Any materially false statement in connection with the purchase of the firearm, including on the federal form, would subject an individual to prosecution by the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sentence by the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania) following his conviction for possession of a controlled substance, possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, and persons not to possess, use, manufacture, control, sell, or transfer firearms. He argued the evidence was insufficient to show he was in constructive possession of firearms in close proximity to the contraband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police department executed a search warrant. Defendant and his girlfriend were observed in bed together in their undergarments. There was a bulk quantity of cocaine in a plastic bag on top of the bedroom dresser. Defendant told the police that there were two guns, but that one was legal because it was registered to his girlfriend. He led an officer to the gun registered to his girlfriend, a fully-loaded nine-millimeter handgun, inside a box in the closet of the room where he had slept. At defendant's direction, an officer located the other gun, an unloaded and unregistered.380 revolver, in the pocket of an adult-sized leather jacket hanging in the children's bedroom closet. Defendant admitted to selling the cocaine. The appellate court held that examining the totality of the circumstances, there was sufficient evidence to prove that defendant had both the ability to exercise conscious control or dominion over the firearms and the intent to exercise that control. The appellate court did not have to determine whether the second firearm in the children's bedroom was likewise in close proximity to the cocaine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence by the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County (Pennsylvania) following his conviction for failing to register as sexual offender pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.2(a)(2)(i).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual offenses in Texas, which included the obligation to register with authorities. Although defendant registered with the police when he first came to Pennsylvania, he failed to notify them when he moved. Defendant claimed, inter alia, that because &sect; 9795.2(a)(2)(i) did not go in effect until after he changed residences, the complaint was untimely. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the amendments to &sect; 9795.2, to which defendant referred, changed nothing as far as his reporting requirements were concerned. Consequently, there was no improper ex post facto application of the law. Defendant's absolute failure to register represented an ongoing violation of &sect; 9795.2. Thus, the statute of limitations did not begin to run and so could not have been violated. The reference to the violation of &sect; 9795.2, which included specific references to those who were required to register pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.1, as well as the registration procedures found in &sect; 9795.2, provided abundant notice to defendant that he violated the law and was subject to prosecution pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 4915 for that violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which convicted her of third degree murder and criminal conspiracy, and sentenced her to 17 to 34 years in prison. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdicts, and her constitutional right of confrontation was denied when the trial court permitted child witnesses to testify by way of videotape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the appellate court found that the evidence was sufficient in quantity and quality to sustain defendant's convictions for third degree murder and criminal conspiracy (18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 903). Evidence linking defendant to the victim's death was elicited from the victim's sister, who testified that she was awakened by the victim's crying, which caused co-defendant to grab the victim by the feet and throw her behind a bed at defendant's direction. There was no violation of the Confrontation Clause in Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, or U.S. Const. amend. VI, because the trial court determined that testifying in court in the presence of defendant would cause the child witnesses severe emotional distress that would impair their ability to communicate truthfully and accurately, and the trial court satisfied the elemental aspects of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5984.1. Specifically, the child witnesses' testimony was taken under oath, defendant observed and heard the child witnesses' testimony, defendant's counsel was able to cross-examine the child witnesses, and defendant and her counsel had adequate opportunity to communicate during the child witnesses' testimony in order to mount a proper defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of York County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), following his convictions for driving under the influence (DUI) and driving while operating privilege was suspended in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1543, 3802(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised many issues. The appellate court found that the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress because a police officer did not violate the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act, specifically 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8953(a)(2), where the officer had reasonable suspicion, pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6308(b), to believe that defendant was driving under suspension while both defendant and the officer were in the officer's primary jurisdiction, and after stopping defendant outside the officer's primary jurisdiction, the officer observed facts that gave rise to probable cause of a DUI violation. In addition, the Commonwealth was not required, pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1547, to provide evidence to establish the reliability of defendant's blood alcohol content test because the trial court took judicial notice of the Pennsylvania Bulletin, which listed the York County Hospital as an approved facility for testing blood, and defendant did not come forward with any specific allegations of testing errors. Also, the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant because he smelled a strong odor of alcohol; defendant slurred his speech and became verbally combative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of three counts of robbery, two counts of aggravated assault, and one count of possessing an instrument of crime. The Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), sentenced defendant to life in prison, as authorized by 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&nbsp;9714(a)(2). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that a jury, rather than the judge, should have determined whether to sentence defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9714. The superior court concluded that because the protections of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution did not extend to the fact of prior convictions and because it was solely the existence of two prior convictions that caused defendant to be eligible to possibly be sentenced within a range of increased penalties, the trial court properly imposed the judgment of sentence. The superior court held that &sect;&nbsp;9714(a)(2) did not require a jury determination, but only required the showing of two prior convictions for crimes of violence before it afforded the trial court discretion to impose a life sentence. Because the trial court had the statutory discretion, but was not mandated to impose a life sentence, the trial court did not err in its imposition of sentence. The superior court further determined that the trial court did not violate defendant's constitutional rights by considering facts that were not determined by the jury.</SPAN></P>
