</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants sought review of an order from the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which, in their declaratory judgment action against appellees, the Arkansas State Board of Collection Agencies and its board members, held that the Arkansas Check-Cashers Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 23-52-101- 23-52-117 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2007), was constitutional. The Arkansas Financial Services Association was permitted to intervene in the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants brought an action against appellees, alleging that all transactions under the Act involved interest rates that violated the usury provision of Ark. Const. art. 19, &sect; 13. Appellants sought a declaratory judgment that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court denied appellants' request for a declaratory judgment and found that the Act was constitutional. On appeal, the court found that declaratory relief was proper in the case under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-111-104 (2006). A justiciable controversy was present between appellants and the Board as to the implementation, application, and effect of the Act. Further, the court found that the Act clearly authorized usurious interest rates. Sample contracts contained in the record reflected annual percentage rates (APRs) ranging from 168.20 percent to 558.71 percent. Such rates of interest were clearly and unmistakably usurious and in violation of Ark. Const. art. 19, &sect; 13(a), (b). The Act's provisions concerning the business of check-cashing and the business of deferred-presentment options were so intertwined that severance was inappropriate. The court declared the entirety of the Act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, the husband and special administrator of a deceased patient's estate, challenged a judgment of the Johnson County Circuit Court (Arkansas) granting summary judgment, under Ark. R. Civ. P. 56, in favor of appellee medical center on the grounds of charitable immunity, in the husband's wrongful death suit against the medical center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court determined that the medical center was entitled to both governmental and charitable immunity. The court found that the medical center's charter limited it to charitable or elemosynary purposes, that the charter contained a not-for-profit limitation, and that the medical center provided services free of charge to those unable to pay. The issues regarding the medical center's profit and its practice of filing suit to collect unpaid medical bills were not matters of disputed fact, but rather they were differing legal interpretations of undisputed facts. The existence of profit was not determinative of charitable status. Because there were no disputed facts, the trial court correctly determined, as a matter of law and under Ark. R. Civ. P. 56, that the medical center was a charity entitled to immunity. The husband was not unconstitutionally denied his right to a jury trial, under Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 7, because no factual issues existed in the case. The court also held that the husband was not entitled to relate-back to his first amended complaint in an attempt to name the medical center's liability insurance carrier as a defendant because the complaint was a nullity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant property owner sought review of an order from the Benton County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which upheld the denial of an application for a permit to build a rock quarry by appellee, an appeal review board of a county planning board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner sought a permit to build a rock quarry. The planning board granted its approval. However, a group of landowners appealed the decision to the county appeal review board. The review board reversed the planning board's decision, finding that the proposed development was not compatible with surrounding land uses. The trial court upheld the decision of the review board. On appeal, the owner argued that the planning board's ordinance concerning large scale plan requirements, Benton County, Ark., Ordinance &sect; 2(B)(4), was void for vagueness. The ordinance required that a proposed development be consistent and compatible with existing development and the environment. The court found that &quot;compatible&quot; had a plain and ordinary meaning. The three clauses that followed the &quot;compatibility&quot; requirement were to be considered as factors that guided the exercise of the review board's discretion. Their presence did not render the mandatory clause unconstitutionally void. The record was replete with evidence that the county considered the compatibility of the owner's proposed quarry in the context of the ordinance's discretionary restraints.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant employee sought review of an order from the Arkansas Court of Appeals, which upheld an order from the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission denying his claim for workers' compensation benefits from appellees, a home builder, an insurer, and an Ohio company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee was hired as a crew leader by the home builder. The employee received paychecks from various companies. In early 2004, the employee's paychecks came from the Ohio company. The employee was injured on the job in April 2004. He received biweekly temporary total disability benefits for approximately 17 to 18 weeks from the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation. He initiated a claim for benefits in Arkansas in July 2004. The Commission denied the claim, finding that he was estopped by the election-of-remedies doctrine. The court of appeals upheld the decision. On review, the court held that the factual issue of whether the employee knowingly initiated a claim for benefits in Ohio and knowingly received benefits from Ohio, did not amount to an election of remedies that precluded the possibility of receiving benefits under Arkansas workers' compensation laws. Further, an agreement signed by the employee to select the State of Ohio as the state of exclusive remedy was void and unenforceable under both the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Law, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-108 (2002), and the Arkansas Insurance Code, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-92-409(c)(4)(A) (2004).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a medical malpractice case, plaintiffs, a patient and his wife, appealed a judgment of the Benton County Circuit Court (Arkansas) in favor of defendant doctor, arguing that, because the case had been remanded for a trial on the issue of damages only, the circuit court erred in permitting the doctor to introduce evidence on the issue of proximate causation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient and his wife filed a medical malpractice case, and a default judgment was rendered against the doctor, who challenged the entry of a judgment against her in the amount of $500,000. While the court affirmed entry of the default judgment, it vacated the damages award and remanded the case for a trial on that issue. At trial, judgment was rendered in favor of the doctor. In reviewing the appeal of the patient and his wife, the court ruled that the circuit court abused its discretion in permitting the doctor to introduce evidence regarding proximate causation because causation was an element of liability, not of damages. The doctor was found liable for medical malpractice by the entry of the default judgment against her. She was entitled to a hearing to determine the amount of damages resulting from her malpractice, but she was not entitled to challenge her liability during the hearing on damages. While the doctor had the right to cross-examine the patient's witnesses, to introduce evidence in mitigation of damages, and to question on appeal the sufficiency of the evidence, she could not be permitted to introduce evidence to defeat the patient's cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant alleged offender challenged a decision from the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which, after a remand, affirmed a Level 3 sex offender assessment and rejected the offender's due process arguments relating to appellee Sex Offender Assessment Committee (SOAC).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The offender entered guilty pleas to one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree and two counts of sexual indecency with a child. Thereafter, an assessment was conducted by the Sex Offender Screening and Risk Assessment program (SOSRA). The offender was later notified that he was a Level 3 offender. The SOAC upheld this assessment. The offender sought judicial review, the case was remanded, and the Level 3 assessment was again upheld. This appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court noted that the offender was not entitled to a hearing under the Arkansas Sex Offender Registration Act of 1997, Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-12-901 to 12-12-920 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2007). He contended that he had a constitutional due process right to receive such. In rejecting this argument, the supreme court noted that the offender had a meaningful opportunity to be heard under the facts of this case because of the procedure, which included a face-to-face SOSRA interview and the SOAC review. Therefore, the offender's procedural due-process rights under either the Arkansas or United States Constitutions were not violated by denying him a second face-to-face interview before SOAC.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A Florida court granted the company a judgment against an employee. The company filed the foreign judgment with the trial court, which issued a writ of garnishment upon the employer. The employer failed to file an answer. The company requested that the trial court order the employer to appear and answer the allegations and interrogatories served with the writ of garnishment. The trial court entered a writ of garnishment against the employer in the amount of $ 5,947, which was the amount it owed at the time of service of the writ, plus the amount of nonexempt wages earned through the date of judgment. The trial court denied the employer's motion for reconsideration. On appeal, the court found that the company properly registered a valid foreign judgment in the trial court as provided by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-66-602 (2005), and the trial court had jurisdiction to issue a writ of garnishment upon the employer. However, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-110-407 (2006) specifically limited a defaulting garnishee's liability to the amount of nonexempt wages held at the time of service of the writ of garnishment, plus attorney fees and other expenses appropriate under the facts and circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The victim was his daughter. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the rape, 10 years in prison for being an accomplice, and 10 years in prison for the abuse of a minor. The sentences were to run consecutively. On appeal, he claimed that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of the victim's prior conduct under the rape-shield statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-42-101(b) (1999). Defendant had sought to introduce evidence involving an allegation made by the victim that her stepfather had molested her. The court found that the trial court did not clearly err in determining that the evidence of the victim's prior recantation was only slightly relevant, if at all, to the victim's credibility and that such evidence was more prejudicial than probative. The victim's prior allegation against her stepfather was not false because the victim's mother had discovered sexually explicit photographs of the victim taken by her stepfather. The trial court did not err in refusing to give defendant's proffered jury instruction regarding eligibility to transfer to community punishment supervision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Lincoln County Circuit Court (Arkansas) that convicted her of two counts of sexual assault in the third degree, arguing that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress because her statement was not voluntarily given and erred in declining to recognize her due process right to have the entire interrogation recorded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was a psychologist with the Arkansas Department of Corrections until she engaged in sexual intercourse with an inmate. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's suppression motion. Although defendant claimed that her confession was the involuntary because it was the product of false promises, the detective denied promising defendant that she would not go to jail or that her license as a psychologist would not be affected, and it was for the trial judge to determine which witness was more credible. Because defendant was educated and intelligent, was not unfamiliar with the criminal justice system, and admittedly waived her Miranda rights and agreed to speak with the detective, the court concluded that defendant's confession was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently given. The court declined to recognize a constitutional right under Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 8, to have all phases of a police interrogation recorded. Even if such a right were recognized, however, any error would be harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, including the testimony of a corrections officer who witnessed the sexual contact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment of conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of rape and sentenced to 300 months in prison. His codefendant was acquitted. Defendant's conviction was upheld on direct appeal. Defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief under Rule 37.1. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, defendant complained that his due process rights were denied to him as shown solely by the inconsistent verdicts. The court concluded that the verdict in the codefendant's trial had no constitutional implications vis-a-vis the verdict in defendant's trial. The inconsistent verdicts did not demonstrate a constitutional error that rendered the judgment in defendant's case a complete nullity. Such a determination precluded defendant from raising the issue of unconstitutional inconsistent verdicts for the first time in a postconviction motion. There was no fundamental unfairness in accepting the jury's verdict in defendant's case, even if it was inconsistent with another verdict, and defendant failed to demonstrate otherwise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, Arkansas companies licensed to sell wholesale cigarettes in Arkansas, sought review of an order from the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which declared ultra vires and unconstitutional certain portions of a cost and minimum price rule in a declaratory judgment action brought by appellees, out-of-state companies licensed to sell wholesale cigarettes in Arkansas. Appellees moved to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellees filed a complaint against the Arkansas Tobacco Control Board and its director for a declaratory judgment to determine the validity of &sect; 15 of the Rules and Regulations of the Board. Appellants were allowed to intervene in the action. The trial court declared certain portions of &sect; 15 ultra vires of the Arkansas Unfair Cigarette Sales Act and unconstitutional. While the appeal was pending, the Board ultimately promulgated a completely new version of &sect; 15 and repealed the version of &sect; 15 that was challenged in the declaratory judgment action. On appeal, the court found that when the Board repealed the version of &sect; 15 that was the subject of the challenge, the appeal of the trial court's ruling on that same &sect; 15 was rendered moot. Any construing of statutes that was required in the case had to be done in the context of the challenged regulation. Because the challenged regulation no longer existed, the court was void of a context in which to construe the statute, and the appeal was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted appellees' motion to dismiss the appeal. The case was remanded for entry of a decree stating that the grounds upon which the trial court relied for entering the declaratory judgment and injunction became moot by the repeal of the challenged &sect; 15.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Benton County Circuit Court, Arkansas, reversed an administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision that appellee minor had to remain listed on the Arkansas Child Maltreatment Central Registry. Appellant, Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS), appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The DHS argued that the minor's due-process right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses was not violated and that the ALJ's finding of child maltreatment was supported by substantial evidence. The supreme court found that the minor had shown nothing but the potential for prejudice. When compared to the government's interest in presenting its case without traumatizing child victims, DHS was not and should not have been required to call the victim to testify. The minor was afforded the opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses but waived his right by failing to present their testimony. He could not argue that his due-process rights were violated. Under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-12-503 of the Arkansas Child Maltreatment Act, all that was required was proof that the minor engaged in actual or attempted sexual intercourse, deviate sexual activity, or sexual contact by forcible compulsion with the victim. There was evidence that the minor engaged in both deviate sexual activity and sexual contact by forcible compulsion with the victim. DHS offered a reasonable explanation for its decision not to present the victim's testimony at the administrative hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The order of the circuit court was reversed, and the decision of the Arkansas Department of Human Services was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The former mayor contended that he was entitled to retirement benefits pursuant to West Helena, Ark., Ordinance 4B (2005). The city claimed that Ordinance 4B was invalid because it contradicted Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 24-12-123 (Supp. 2007) and that pursuant to &sect; 24-12-123 the former mayor was not yet entitled to retirement benefits. The court found that pursuant to Ark. Const. art. 12, &sect; 4 no municipal corporation was authorized to pass any laws contrary to the general laws of the State of Arkansas. In addition, the court determined that city ordinances that were in conflict with Arkansas statutes were void under the Arkansas Constitution. Section 24-12-123(a)(3) controlled the manner in which a mayor's previous years of service as a former elected official or employee of the city could be added to his or her years of service as a mayor for retirement benefit purposes. Ordinance 4B provided that a mayor could apply all years of previous service toward his retirement benefits. It was in direct conflict with &sect; 24-12-123. The court concluded the Ordinance 4B could not override the requirements of &sect; 24-12-123. Accordingly, the former mayor was not currently entitled to retirement benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant State sought review, or in the alternative a writ of certiorari, of an order of the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) declaring Act 1782 (2001) (Act) unconstitutional upon a motion of appellee parolee, who contended that the Act unconstitutionally repealed the sunset clause of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-93-611 (2006) requiring persons convicted of certain offenses to serve 70 percent of their sentence prior to parole eligibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At a sentencing hearing of the parolee, who pleaded guilty to several controlled substances charges, the circuit court made an oral ruling on a collateral motion regarding parole eligibility, declaring the Act unconstitutional. A written order was entered almost a year later and held that the seventy percent rule would not apply to the parolee. Although the State's brief presented an important issue to the correct and uniform administration of the criminal law and upon which the court could hear an appeal pursuant to Ark. R. App. P. Crim. 3, the State's direct appeal was not timely under Ark. R. App. P. Crim. 2(e) (2008) because the notice of appeal was not filed within thirty days of the written order. However, the court had the discretion to treat an appeal from an order, judgment, or decree lacking in judicial support as if it were brought up on petition for writ of certiorari. The court held that the circuit court did not have authority to rule upon the parolee's motion. The ruling as to Act 1782 was not included in the parolee's judgment or commitment order, and Ark. R. Civ. P. 60(a) (2008), allowing a circuit court to modify a judgment, did not apply to criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant corporation sought an interlocutory review of an order of the Miller County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which granted appellee pickup truck owner's request for class certification under Ark. R. Civ. P. 23. The owner filed an action alleging that the corporation sold around 4 million pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles with defectively designed parking brakes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation challenged the circuit court's findings as to predominance, superiority, and the class definition. The court found that whether or not the class vehicles contained a defectively designed parking-brake system and whether or not the corporation concealed that defect were predominating questions. The fact that various states' laws could be required in determining certain issues, such as damages or restitution, did not defeat predominance. The court held that the circuit court was not required to engage in a choice of law analysis prior to certifying the class. With regard to the issue of predominance, the court determined that the proposed class of around 4 million members made it at least likely that without a class action numerous meritorious claims could go unaddressed. In addition, the uniform relief sought was relatively small if sought on an individual basis, and thus, it was not economically feasible for members of the class to pursue the corporation on an individual basis. Finally, the class definition was sufficiently precise because the class was identifiable from objective criteria, specifically, ownership of the specified vehicles so specifically equipped.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the circuit court's order granting class certification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Pulaski County Circuit Court, Arkansas, granted summary judgment to appellees, as members of the Board of Education of the Little Rock School District, the Board of Education of the Little Rock School District of Pulaski County, Arkansas, and the Little Rock School District of Pulaski County, Arkansas (Board), on appellant taxpayers' claim that paying severance pay to the terminated superintendent was illegal. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers argued that the circuit court erred in finding that they had the burden of introducing evidence to establish the existence of a material question of fact. The supreme court found that the Board met its burden of showing there was no genuine issue of material fact. The superintendent's contract was properly before the court as an exhibit to the taxpayers' complaint. Absent a showing of a genuine issue of material fact, the question of whether payment of severance pay as part of the termination of the superintendent pursuant to the employment contract fell under the constitutional rubric of maintenance and operation of the public schools could be decided as a matter of law. Exactly what expenditures should be made to benefit a school district was a matter for the Board to determine, Ark. Const. art. 14, &sect; 3. The taxpayer's attempts to characterize the payment to the superintendent as private and one solely for his benefit had to fail. While the specific payment plan involving the superintendent may not be capable of repetition, the issue of whether severance pay in superintendent employment contracts was constitutional was one of substantial public interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner state inmate filed a pro se motion for rule on clerk, seeking to proceed with an appeal an order of the Circuit Court of Pulaski County (Arkansas) that denied his petition for declaratory judgment. The inmate had claimed that the aggravated robbery statute under which he had been convicted was not a complete statute and violated Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The motion was treated as a motion for belated appeal pursuant to Ark. R. App. P. Crim. 2(e) because the notice of appeal was untimely filed in the trial court. The inmate's reasons for failing to perfect the appeal were not considered as he could not have prevailed on appeal. Specifically, the declaratory judgment action was properly dismissed as the inmate had cited no legal foundation for his claim and thus, he had not demonstrated that a justiciable controversy existed. Moreover, he misconstrued the language, purpose, and application of Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect; 23, as it did not prohibit the legislative drafting technique of making a cross-reference to other statutes governing related matters. It was also apparent that the actual purpose of bringing the declaratory judgment action was an attempt to overturn his criminal convictions. A declaratory judgment action was not a substitute for an ordinary appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Other than general arguments as to the constitutionality of the statutes cited by defendant in the motion, defendant raised no valid argument or authority to review the constitutional claims that he presented. Furthermore, he had no direct or collateral remedy with which to pursue his claims. The motion filed in the trial court could not have been acted upon as a direct appeal from the judgment since defendant pled guilty, and there was no apparent basis for a direct appeal from the plea, Ark. R. App. P. Crim. 1. Other than a petition under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1, there were no collateral remedies for defendant to pursue, and defendant's motion failed to raise grounds cognizable under an available postconviction procedure. Moreover, the pro se motion was filed more than five years after entry of the judgment, which was well outside the time limitations imposed in Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.2(c). Furthermore, Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1 required that an defendant be incarcerated when seeking a remedy under the rule, and he was not.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer's due process rights were violated because the State failed to take additional steps to notify the taxpayer of a tax sale after an initial notice was returned undelivered. The taxpayer asserted that, as the prevailing party, he was entitled to recovery of attorney's fees at each stage of the litigation. The circuit court denied the request because it found that the first mention of 42 U.S.C.S &sect; 1983 was in the status report. The taxpayer argued that an action did not have to be specifically pled under &sect; 1983 for entitlement to attorney's fees under &sect; 1988(b). The State asserted that under Ark. R. Civ. P. 54(e), the taxpayer forfeited his entitlement to attorney's fees because he failed to file the motion within 14 days of the supreme court's mandate. The supreme court noted that only until a final judgment that denied the Commissioner's request to reopen the question of liability, ordered that the taxpayer be given his house back, denied the taxpayer requested attorney's fees, and ordered the clerk to close the case was a motion for attorney's fees appropriate. Substance prevailed over form when a party failed to specifically plead an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant petitioner challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Fulton County, Arkansas, denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus under 2001 Ark. Acts 1780, codified as Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-112-201--16-112-208 (2006). The petitioner filed a motion to supplement the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1997, a jury found the petitioner guilty of rape and sentenced him to 240 months' imprisonment in the Arkansas Department of Correction. The reviewing court denied the petitioner's motion for belated appeal. In 2006, the petitioner, through counsel, filed the instant appeal. The reviewing court held that there was no error in denying relief. A review of the petition revealed that it was defective in that it failed to rebut the statutory presumption against timeliness and did not comply with the procedural requirements of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-112-202(7). The petitioner failed to show that identity was an issue during the investigation or prosecution of the offense. The petitioner also argued that the record failed to contain a number of pertinent documents. The reviewing court found that the tendered supplement included an amendment to the petition in the trial court and other pleadings not contained in the original record before the reviewing court. Although not explicitly, the order did appear to consider the petition, the amendment, and the other pleadings, and those documents were therefore essential to any review of the order denying the petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supreme court noted that the city's constitutionality argument was properly before it. The city argued that Ark.

The supreme court found that under the statute, a BZA was an administrative agency and, despite the city's argument that the city's BZA made a legislative determination, a BZA did not have the power to legislate. Not only did a BZA not have the power to legislate, it was clear that the city's BZA was acting in an adjudicatory or quasi-judicial manner when it denied the owner's variance request because it related to the enforcement of an already-established ordinance. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-56-425 was not a violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion for directed verdict because the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. The supreme court disagreed. The victim's testimony that she was fifteen years of age at the time of the two charged rapes, that she grew up in defendant's home and considered him her father, and that defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with her was sufficient to support the rape convictions. Moreover, the victim's testimony was corroborated by other reliable evidence. The forensic DNA analyst's testimony that the semen found on the sock and the underwear matched the DNA sample provided by defendant, along with the nurse practitioner's testimony that the victim's injuries were consistent with sexual abuse, provided proof beyond the victim's testimony. Other witnesses testified as to defendant's opportunities to engage in sexual intercourse with the victim. Clearly, the evidence supporting defendant's convictions was substantial. The victim's uncorroborated testimony would have been sufficient, and the testimony of the nurse practitioner as to the victim's injuries further supported the jury's determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict on the capital murder charge because: (1) but for defendant's aggravated robbery, speeding, and fleeing from the police, the trooper would not have been in the roadway attempting to retrieve stop sticks and would not have been struck by another trooper's vehicle; (2) the State presented sufficient evidence that defendant acted under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life, as it showed that defendant robbed the victim with a gun, fled with his accomplice and the loot in a stolen car on a busy interstate, and initiated a high-speed chase while being pursued by several law enforcement officers with their lights and sirens blaring, thereby engaging in life-threatening activity; and (3) the phrase &quot;under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life&quot; was not void for vagueness, as the cases interpreting the phrase provided fair warning that it involved a life-threatening activity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee customer sought relief in appellant Arkansas Board of Collection Agencies against appellant surety in the form of release of a bond to satisfy a judgment that the customer had previously won against a payday lender. The board denied relief. The Pulaski Circuit Court (Arkansas) reversed the board's order. The board and the surety appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">According to the court, the question presented was whether the lender violated the laws of Arkansas so as to invoke the terms of the surety's bond. The surety and the board argued that liability was limited to violations of the Check-Cashers Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 23-52-101 to 23-52-117 (2007) and the board's rules and regulations, which were not yet adopted when the bond was issued in 1999. However, the court noted that the bond's language protected against loss or damage suffered by any person resulting from the lender's violation of the &quot;applicable laws of the State [of] Arkansas,&quot; including Arkansas' usury laws, such as Ark. Const. art. 19, &sect; 13(a). The surety argued that it was entitled to rely on a Check-Cashers Act provision, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-52-104(b) (2000)--under which check-casher fees were not interest--before that provision was declared unconstitutional in 2001, but the court held that it was incumbent upon the surety to know and abide by the clear public policy of Arkansas regardless of one legislative act (the Check-Casher Act) that ran counter to that policy. By the surety's failure to do so, it violated the laws of Arkansas and became liable under the bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant's 174-year sentence for felony rape, incest and violation of a minor were affirmed. The Circuit Court of Independence County, Arkansas denied his writ of habeas corpus based upon new scientific evidence under Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-112-201 to 16-112-208 (2006), which was affirmed on appeal. Appellant filed pro se a second petition to vacate and/or set aside judgment, which was also denied. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On review, the supreme court determined that it need not consider the motion as it was apparent that appellant could not prevail in his appeal if it were permitted to go forward. In his previous petition, appellant claimed that the evidence used to convict him was obtained as a result of an unconstitutional search and seizure. In the instant petition, he sought to use scientific testing to prove that the search conducted by the police was initiated prior to authorization of the search by the victim and was unconstitutional. Because appellant had previously raised the issue of an unconstitutional search and seizure in his prior petition and made the same argument in the instant petition, the trial court did not err in denying a successive petition for similar relief. Moreover, this argument presented a basis for summary denial of the petition. Claims pertaining to the admissibility of evidence were not within the purview of a proceeding under Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-112-201 to 16-112-208 (2006). Also, appellant's evidentiary argument did not involve actual scientific testing of specific evidence that was introduced at trial to secure his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant owner challenged a decision from the Benton County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which granted a default judgment in favor of appellee State in a civil forfeiture case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner was arrested for a drug offense, and his vehicle was seized. He was served with a summons and complaint when forfeiture proceedings were instituted against the vehicle. The owner's answer did not contain a personal verification, and the State's motion for a default judgment was granted. This appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court held that, under Ark. R. Civ. P. 11(a) (2007), a verification could have been required by rule or statute. In this case, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-64-505(g)(4) (Supp. 2005) had a specific requirement for a verification. Therefore, the answer was void and had no effect. Next, the summons was not deficient under Ark. R. Civ. P. 4(b) merely because it left out the verification requirements. Further, it was proper to name the vehicle in the caption, rather than the owner. The summons was also not defective for later listing the owner as the person to whom the summons was directed. Under Ark. R. Civ. P. 55(c), since the judgment was not void, the owner was required to demonstrate a meritorious defense. Since this standard was not met, the granting of the default judgment was proper. Finally, a constitutional issue was not addressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Columbia County Circuit Court, Arkansas, awarded damages to appellee property owner, resulting from seismic operations conducted by appellants, a production company and an energy company. The seismic operations were conducted upon surface lands owned by the property owner. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property owner and his mother owned 80 acres of land, which included a one-half interest in the mineral estate underlying the surface property. The family entered into an oil and gas lease with the energy company. The production company argued that the circuit court erred in finding that it trespassed on the property owner's property. Notwithstanding the production company's right to explore as a result of its one-half mineral rights, the production company violated Rule B-42 of the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission by failing to obtain the property owner's consent. Further, Rule B-42 was constitutional as applied. Next, the appellate court held that the permission to conduct seismic operations was a license and was not an assignment. The payment to the property owner in unjust-enrichment damages was too speculative, particularly in light of the fact that the amount was not substantiated and neither the production company nor the energy company had the intent to drill. Also, because there was no breach of contract, there could be no tortious interference. Moreover, because there was no breach of contract, the trial court should not have awarded compensatory damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appellate court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for a recalculation of actual damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his battery conviction. The supreme court disagreed. The evidence showed that defendant acted recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life. Specifically, the evidence demonstrated that defendant drove a fully loaded commercial vehicle weighing over 82,000 pounds while under the influence of methamphetamine. According to an expert witness, methamphetamine could cause a driver to weave across lanes of traffic, take undue risks, or leave the roadway. Defendant's entire vehicle, with the exception of the right rear axel, crossed into the oncoming-traffic lane, striking the motor home, and ultimately driving through it. Defendant never attempted to brake prior to the accident or to return to the proper lane of traffic. It was apparent based on the evidence in that defendant exhibited reckless conduct that involved a conscious disregard of a perceived risk. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for directed verdict on the first-degree battery charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted in the Sebastian County Circuit Court (Arkansas) of possession of a controlled substance (methamphetamine) with intent to deliver, possession of drug paraphernalia, and theft by receiving.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for possession of methamphetamine because he was not in possession of the methamphetamine that was found in the truck on his property. The supreme court disagreed. Officers testified that defendant was the registered owner of the white truck found in his backyard and that no other person was found at defendant's residence or in his yard. A witness testified that he observed a man matching defendant's description driving a white truck. When defendant left the residence, the bed of the truck was empty, but when he returned, the bed of the truck was full. A parole officer testified that she found the coat with methamphetamine in defendant's truck in defendant's backyard. As the State points out, when the truck was searched, it was immediately and exclusively accessible to defendant, and he was in close proximity to the methamphetamine. The only evidence submitted by defendant to refute any ownership or possessory interest in the truck was his own statement that someone else had borrowed his truck. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Garland County Circuit Court, Arkansas, entered an order granting summary judgment to appellee Racing Commission, and appellee franchise holders, and dismissing appellant citizens' complaint, which alleged that 2005 Ark. Acts 1151, permitting the public's authorization of wagering on electronic games of skill at horse and greyhound racing parks, was unconstitutional. The citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The citizens claimed that the Act was invalid in that it unlawfully delegated the legislature's authority to two private entities, franchise holders, to determine whether a county-wide or city-wide election should be held on wagering on electronic games of skill. The challenge was properly before the supreme court. The supreme court could not say that 2005 Ark. Acts 1151 constituted an impermissible delegation of legislative authority. Authority was not unlawfully delegated to the Commission when the legislature directed the Commission, in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-113-201(f)(2)(A)(i), to make a finding as to whether a game and electronic device or machine constituted an electronic game of skill. For their final point on appeal, the citizens argued that Act 1151 was special legislation because it arbitrarily allowed franchise holders to operate electronic gambling machines on their properties while making it a criminal offense for all other persons in the state to operate the same. The supreme court held that there was nothing irrational or arbitrary about the legislature's decision. The citizens failed to meet their burden in showing the Act was clearly unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant gas utility sued appellees, a steel manufacturer, a county, the county court, and members of the county quorum court, challenging a lease the county entered into with the manufacturer, subject to an easement in land that had been conveyed to the county for public recreation purposes. The Sebastian County Circuit Court, Fort Smith District, Arkansas, rendered a summary judgment against the utility. The utility appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On review, the utility contended the circuit court erred in finding that the county properly entered into the lease and granted the easement. The appellate court disagreed, finding that giving the words their ordinary meaning and usually accepted meaning in common language, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-164-205 (1998) was plain, unambiguous, and provided that any municipality or county could contract or alienate any land or facilities of any and every nature whatever in securing or developing industry. Thus, the grant of the second easement by the county to allow the manufacturer to obtain gas for its industrial operations was permitted under the plain meaning of this statute. As the utility offered no evidence that the county had become a stockholder in the manufacturer, or any evidence that the county had appropriated money, or loaned its credit to the manufacturer, there was no merit to the utility's argument that Ark. Const. art. XII, &sect; 5 was violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant driver filed a complaint against appellee motorist in which the driver alleged that the motorist was negligent in the operation of his vehicle. The driver also alleged that she had incurred medical expenses. The motorist filed a complaint against a third-party. The Circuit Court of Grant County, Arkansas, entered a judgment reflecting the jury's verdict finding the stranger to be 100 percent at fault. The driver appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The driver alleged to have incurred medical expenses. The motorist alleged that the stranger had swerved into the motorist's lane of travel. The motorist responded by claiming  that an unknown person in a red automobile negligently swerved into the motorist's lane of traffic, thereby causing the motorist to lose control and hit the median. The motorist also asserted that the negligence of the stranger, together with the driver's negligence, was the sole and proximate cause of the driver's damages, if any. Additionally, the motorist reserved the right to have the negligence of a nonparty assessed. At issue on appeal was whether the circuit court erred in refusing to declare that the Arkansas General Assembly's enactment of the Civil Justice Reform Act unconstitutionally infringed upon the authority of the supreme court to establish rules of procedure. The supreme court concluded that because the litigation in this case had been resolved as it pertained to the named parties, and because neither party stood to lose or gain financially based upon the outcome of this appeal, the supreme court declined on grounds of mootness to address the merits of the sole point on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1998 and 2006, defendant pleaded guilty to Arkansas drug charges and received suspended sentences. In 2006, defendant entered a plea of guilty to revocation of the first suspended sentence and received a prison sentence. Defendant petitioned for postconviction relief pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1. The Circuit Court of Crittenden County (Arkansas) denied the petition without a hearing, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant maintained that the trial court was prohibited from entering a suspended imposition of sentence in his cases, as the controlling statutes mandated incarceration. However, the appellate court noted that a 1993 act had removed this prohibition. For this reason and others, the appellate court held that all three of defendant's judgments were valid. Defendant's allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit because they failed to provide supporting facts and amounted to mere conclusory statements. Defendant's allegations of prosecutorial misconduct also had no merit because they could have been raised at trial or argued on direct appeal. In addition, the trial court had not been required to hold an evidentiary hearing on the Rule 37.1 petition because the order denying the petition was sufficient to indicate that the trial court had made its findings from the record, and that the record had supported the denial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant alleged an illegal exaction premised because certain acts of the general assembly violated Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect; 29 by not including a &quot;distinct purpose&quot; or, alternatively, constituted special and local legislation in violation of Ark. Const. amend. XIV. The Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) found the acts constitutional. Appellant appealed. Appellees, city officials, cities, a county, museums, and clubs (entities) cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Inter alia, a county filed a motion to dismiss relating to a $ 50,000 appropriation to the county library under 2005 Ark. Acts 932 on grounds of mootness. The Supreme Court of Arkansas held that 2007 Ark. Acts 1290 did not go into effect until July 1, 2007, and, thus, 2005 Ark. Acts 932 was not rendered ineffective until that same date. The result was that a decision regarding the constitutionality of Act 932 handed down prior to July 1, 2007, would not be moot. Indeed, were the supreme court to affirm the decision of the circuit court relative to the county library appropriation prior to July 1, 2007, that money would be available to the library irrespective of 2007 Ark. Acts 1290. The supreme court also held that the acts were unconstitutional in that they failed to state a distinct purpose as required by Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect;&nbsp;29. The stated purpose in each act was either to provide &quot;state assistance&quot; or &quot;state aid.&quot; Those stated purposes did not comply with the requirement of art. 5, &sect;&nbsp;29, and the supreme court's precedent. The mere statement that the challenged acts will be used for &quot;state assistance&quot; or &quot;state aid&quot; did not explain &quot;how&quot; the funds would be used.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The orders of the circuit court relating to the acts were reversed. The case was remanded. The judgment of the trial court on the cross-appeal was affirmed. The motion to dismiss the appeal was denied.</SPAN></P>

However, the trial date had been established eight months in advance, and there was no objection by defendant at that time concerning the trial date. Defendant did not provide any evidence that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel or that he was not adequately represented. There was no evidence that the trial testimony of the witness would differ from his testimony given in a pretrial hearing. It was also not shown that the witness would have been available to testify had the continuance been granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After appellee County Assessor certified rates and property values for purposes of tax-increment financing, appellant City filed a declaratory judgment and mandatory injunction against appellees, the County, a school district, a public library, et al., seeking redistribution of the tax-increment revenues. The Washington County Circuit Court, Arkansas, concluded that the rates and property values were correct and denied relief. The City appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On review, the City raised several issues challenging the trial court's ruling that the Assessor was correct in its allocation of millage rates. The supreme court agreed that the Assessor was incorrect to allocate more mills to the school district for purposes of the tax-increment financing (TIF) formula than were passed by the voters, which would violate Ark. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 11. However, the supreme court disagreed with the City's argument that Ark. Const. amend. 78 repealed the uniform rate of 25 mills to be used for maintenance and operation of the schools as provided under Ark. Const. amend. 74 as the voters were never put on notice that redevelopment projects would be funded with a portion of the uniform rate of 25 mills that had previously been designated solely for the maintenance and operation of the public school. If the authors of the amendment had meant for it to repeal a particular section of the constitution, they would have said so, but did not. Furthermore, an invincible repugnancy between the amendments did not exist so as to cause a repeal by implication. As such, the trial court properly concluded that Ark. Const. amend. 78 did not alter Ark. Const. amend. 74.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Assessor's certification was modified to the correct millage rate; the trial court's finding that the proceeds of one mill from the tax for libraries was properly included in the Assessor's certification was reversed; otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent was killed when he hit a tractor on a highway. The tractor driver was an employee of the tractor owner. The administratrix contended that the circuit court erred in refusing to instruct the jury to consider certain statutory violations as some evidence of negligence. The supreme court concluded that the administratrix was entitled to an instruction based on Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 27-35-210 (1955). As far as any inconsistency with Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 27-35-102 was concerned, &sect; 27-35-210 was the controlling statute because it was the later-enacted statute. As to the tractor owner's duty of care to the decedent, the administratrix pointed to, among other things, the tractor driver's deposition testimony that he worked for the tractor owner, and the tractor owner was his boss. The trial court erred in not allowing evidence that showed agency or employment. The trial court did not err in denying a motion for directed verdict for the tractor owner. Another issue was whether an amendment to the wrongful-death statute to allow damages for loss of life was procedural or remedial legislation. The supreme court concluded that 2001 Ark. Acts 1516 was meant to be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

A promissory note was executed to evidence the indebtedness. On appeal, the debtor's sole point on appeal was that the circuit court erred when it ruled that the Statutory Foreclosure Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18-50-101 to 18-50-117 (2003), did not violate either the Arkansas or United States Constitution. In essence, the borrower alleged that the act violated procedural due process because the notice requirement failed to give an individual notice of what to do in the event he or she wishes to contest the propriety of a foreclosure. The supreme court disagreed. The supreme court concluded that there was no state action present here. State action did not take place merely because the Arkansas General Assembly passed the act. There were also no state officials involved. The debtor further argued that the statutory foreclosure provisions violate separation of powers, but the debtor failed to raise the argument to the circuit court, and she failed to obtain a ruling on the argument. The supreme court was precluded from addressing the merits of the argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee taxpayer, on behalf of himself and all taxpayers similarly situated, filed an illegal-exaction lawsuit, claiming that the Emergency Income Tax Rule 2003-4, adopted by appellant Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration (DFA) was unconstitutional. The Pulaski County Circuit Court, Arkansas, agreed with the taxpayer. The circuit court ordered a refund to those taxpayers who were improperly taxed in 2003 and 2004.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">For the years 2003 and 2004, the taxpayer was bound by the Emergency Rule, requiring that annuity income from employment-related retirement plans be taxed in accordance with I.R.C. &sect; 72. The taxpayer alleged that the Emergency Rule violated the separation-of-powers doctrine and was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-51-404(b)(24) (Supp. 2003) provided that annuity income from employment-related retirement plans should be taxed in accordance with Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-51-307. The supreme court had previously determined that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-51-307(c) (Supp. 2003) was unconstitutional; hence, the Emergency Rule was enacted, pertaining to recipients of public or private retirement plan benefits. Prior case law clearly held that there was nothing to indicate that the Arkansas General Assembly intended that &sect; 72 be applied to recovery of after-tax contributions in employment-related retirement plans. Further, the General Assembly made it clear that &sect; 72 of the Internal Revenue Code should not apply to annuity income received from these retirement plans. The Emergency Rule was outside the scope of the director's rule-making authority as set forth in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 19-1-208.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supreme court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient contended that the providers failed to properly diagnose her with a tubal pregnancy after she underwent a tubal ligation. She filed a medical malpractice action, but it was dismissed based on a failure to comply with Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;16-114-209(b)(3)(A) (2006). This appeal followed. In reversing, the supreme court held that &sect; 16-114-209(b)(3)(A) directly conflicted with Ark. R. Civ. P. 3. This case was similar to the one decided in Weidrick, where it was determined that a 60-day notice prior to the filing of a medical malpractice action was superceded by Ark. R. Civ. P. 3. Here, the mandatory requirement for an affidavit 30 days after filing a complaint was an added encumbrance for filing a complaint that did not essentially differ from the notice requirement struck down in Weidrick. The automatic dismissal of the case if the affidavit was not filed made this portion of the statute procedural in nature. Since the rules of pleading, practice, and procedures for the Arkansas courts was within the domain of the supreme court, the affidavit requirement ran afoul of Ark. Const. amend. 80, &sect;&nbsp;3. The supreme court noted that the balance of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-209 was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, a state inmate, file a pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus. The Lincoln County Circuit Court, Arkansas, denied the petition. The inmate appealed. The appeal was dismissed. The inmate then filed a pro se motion for reconsideration of that decision, which was denied. Then, for a second time, the inmate brought a pro se motion for reconsideration of the decision to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate resurrected the arguments he made in his previous motion for reconsideration. He argued that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-112-103 (1987), was impermissibly vague and unconstitutional. He asserted that the court was precluded from interpreting the statute under Ark. Const. art. IV, and was required to overturn all prior cases interpreting the statute. The court rejected the inmate's assertion that, by requiring a habeas petitioner to plead either the facial invalidity or the lack of jurisdiction and to make a showing, by affidavit or other evidence, of probable cause to believe he was illegally detained, the court's previous cases added requirements beyond those provided in the statute itself. The court also declined to strike down &sect; 16-112-103 as unconstitutionally vague and thereby eliminate a well-established legal remedy. The statute clearly stated its requirements. The inmate's petition did not state claims that supported issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. The inmate stated no reason for the court to revisit its original decision. Therefore, once again, his motion for reconsideration was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After a second malpractice case was filed, the chiropractor moved for a dismissal, arguing that a letter attached to the complaint did not comply with Ark.

A later affidavit was filed, the trial court determined that a portion of the statute was unconstitutional, and it gave the patient 15 days to file a supplemental affidavit. This was not filed, and the case was dismissed. An appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that the patient failed to submit a proper expert affidavit within 30 days of his second complaint. However, an affidavit from the expert that was filed more than 30 days later was not considered because it was too vague. Both the letter and the affidavit failed to describe the expert's familiarity with the applicable standard of care or how the injury was a proximate cause of the failure to perform within that standard. The patient could not argue for reversal when he declined to file a proper affidavit after more time was given.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After dismissal of two separate sets of criminal charges, the arrestee obtained an expungement under Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;16-90-906 (2006). The arrestee later filed an action contending that the ACIC failed to destroy the records and properly restrict access to them. The circuit court granted summary judgment, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court noted that the records in this case had been electronically segregated; therefore, they were only available to criminal justice agencies for criminal justice purposes under Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;12-12-1008 (2003). There was no merit in the allegation that the ACIC violated any civil rights when it refused to destroy the records because this was not required under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-90-901(a)(1), (2) (2006). Next, the doctrine of respondeat superior was not a basis for liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 based on an allegation of misuse of the arrest records. This rationale also applied to the Arkansas Civil Rights Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;16-123-101 to 16-123-108. Finally, since the trial court did not make a specific ruling on the constitutionality of the ACIC enabling statutes, the issue was not addressed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Code Jud. Conduct Canon 5C(2) sufficient to justify infringement of protected speech under the First Amendment. The supreme court found that the case was factually distinguishable from an Eighth Circuit decision and did not view that decision as decisive. The supreme court did find that Arkansas had a compelling interest in impartiality, as a lack of bias for or against either party involved in a proceeding, where the direct solicitation of money by a judge was at issue. The open-mindedness of judges as a sufficient compelling state interest. Avoiding the appearance of impropriety was also a compelling state interest. Canon 5 was narrowly tailored to meet the State's interest of impartiality and avoiding the appearance of impropriety. Canon 5C(2) provided that candidates may establish campaign committees to conduct fundraising on their behalf. The Judicial Commission's determination that an admonition was appropriate was not clearly erroneous based on evidence of conduct that was, or might be, or might become cause for discipline.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court ordered the parties to mediate the issues. The representative's motion to dispense with mediation was denied. This writ application followed. In denying the petition, the supreme court determined that the granting of such a writ was only appropriate if the circuit court was wholly without jurisdiction and there was no adequate remedy. The circuit court's jurisdiction included all matters previously cognizable by circuit, chancery, probate, and juvenile courts, pursuant to Ark. Const. amend. 80, &sect; 6(A). As such, the circuit court had jurisdiction over the representative's motions stemming from the administration of the estate. Moreover, the interpretation or constitutionality of a statute was an issue that could have been determined by a circuit court and then appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judge raised several legal justifications in support of his petition to compel the opening of the probable-cause meeting: (1) violation of the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act, (2) violation of procedural due process, (3) violation of the First Amendment, and (4) waiver of all confidentiality. The judge requested that his probable-cause meeting be open to the public and news media. The supreme court noted that the Judicial Commission could not give it a specific reason for closing the formal probable-cause meeting. Ark. Const. amend. 66(c) contemplated a hearing before disciplining a judge by reprimand or censure. Where a public admonishment or other required adjustment of the judge's conduct may be the result and where a judge has waived confidentiality without any countervailing reason to close the formal meeting presented by the Judicial Commission, the formal probable-cause meeting had to be open. Matters concerning disciplinary procedure that required immediate attention, such as closing a meeting that may result in a public sanction, were appropriately brought to the supreme court by a petition for writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant was placed on the registry for having a sexual encounter with a 13-year-old. The decision of the DHHS was upheld in an administrative hearing and in a circuit court. This appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that the fact that the administrative law judge and the prosecutor came from the same agency did not amount to a violate of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 8. The combination of investigative and adjudicative functions did not, without more, constitute a due process violation. Appellant did not prove that the process was invalid based simply on the statutory scheme and the procedures in place in this case. Moreover, the supreme court rejected the argument that the standard of evidence should have been changed to a clear and convincing standard. Appellant did not show that he would have prevailed had the standard been higher; moreover, he failed to show that he was denied a specific employment opportunity due to his placement on the registry. Finally, the failure to sustain a hearsay objection and the refusal to consider a defense under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-102 (2003) was not arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Circuit Court of Pulaski County, Arkansas, found that the Sex Offender Registration Act (Act), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-12-901 et seq. (2003 &amp; Supp. 2005), violated federal and state constitutional guarantees of procedural due process, as applied to defendant. It reversed the Sex Offender Assessment Committee's decision to assess defendant as a Level 3 offender. The Department of Correction (DOC) appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The DOC argued that the Act comported with the requirements of due process. The supreme court concluded that defendant was wrong when he protested that the fact of his conduct had never been established; by entering a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, he acceded to the allegation that he engaged in the conduct charged. Because he availed himself of the procedure afforded under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-2-313, defendant's due process rights were not violated. Regardless of the reason one was required to register as a sex offender, the procedures afforded by the Act were the same. Those procedures comported with procedural due-process requirements. The assessment requirement for one who was acquitted of a sex offense by reason of mental disease or defect was rationally related to the State's high and legitimate interest in protecting society from repeat sex offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The circuit court's judgment was reversed; the decision of the Sex Offender Assessment Committee was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The lower court denied the petition. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate essentially challenged the circuit court's findings that he failed to state grounds to support issuance of the writ. The argument that the consecutive sentences were illegal was rejected as the decision to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences rested solely within the province of the trial judge. Thus, there was no Blakely violation. The assertion that the sentence imposed on the murder charge exceeded the presumptive sentence was not cognizable in a habeas petition as consideration of the inmate's allegations of a Blakely violation would have required an examination of the plea proceedings or more of the record than appeared before the appellate court. Thus, consideration of the issue was not suitable for a habeas proceeding. In essence, because the factual basis for the inmate's plea was not indicated on the record, the circuit court could not have determined the issue without inquiry beyond that appropriate to a habeas corpus proceeding. Since the inmate failed to state cognizable claims, he failed to show any basis for a finding that a writ of habeas corpus should have issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant was injured after undergoing an outpatient procedure at the hospital, and the injury allegedly occurred when hospital employees transported the claimant by wheelchair to a waiting car. The hospital was a member of the health system's pooled comprehensive liability program. The circuit court found that the hospital, as a charitable facility, was not subject to suit, and that the pool agreement did not constitute liability insurance for purposes of the direct-action statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-79-210 (2004). The appellate court ruled that the claimant could not bring suit against or collect a judgment from the hospital. Under the charitable-immunity doctrine, the claimant could bring suit against the hospital's liability insurer or employees, but could not bring suit against the charitable organization. Also, there was not the right to sue the health system under the direct-action statute because the program did not meet the statutory definition of insurance, and because the health system did not meet the statutory definition of an insurer under the Arkansas Insurance Code, as it was not in the business of entering into contracts of insurance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant citizen sued appellees, state officials, a city, counties and various organizations, alleging that multiple acts passed in the 2005 general session constituted as special and local legislation in violation of Ark. Const. amend. 14 and Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect; 29. The Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) found that some of the acts were constitutional and others were unconstitutional. The citizen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The citizen filed his complaint and the circuit court initially issued a temporary restraining order against the state defendants to prevent them from disbursement of the funds connected to the contested appropriations. The citizen then amended his complaint and added three defendants. These defendants were never served with process. The supreme court found that the three new defendants added to the complaint were never dismissed. As such, under Ark. R. Civ. P. 54(b) no final order had been entered. With regard to the appeal of the revocation of the restraining order against the city, that was subject to an interlocutory appeal and thus was properly before the court. The act that applied to the city constituted as special and local legislation because the reasons put forth to justify the appropriation to the city for infrastructure, sewer and streets could be advanced by multiple cities and communities throughout the state and no reason rationally related to a legitimate state purpose had been provided for singling out the city for special treatment. Therefore, the act that pertained to the city was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Circuit Court of Union County, Arkansas, affirmed an order of appellee Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission (Commission) ordering appellant corporation to return to the accounting procedures agreed to in the operating agreement and approved by the Commission in its 1996 order. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation argued that the contract dispute between it and cross-appellant company was more appropriately decided by the circuit court. The supreme court found that the operating agreement was reviewed and approved by the Commission and the West Brine Unit Order specifically stated that the Commission retained jurisdiction over the parties. Reading the Brine Production Act (Act), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 15-76-301 et seq. (1994), with the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-15-212(g) (2002), it appeared that the correct procedure for the circuit court to follow was to limit its review to the record and allow the parties to introduce evidence only for the purpose of showing the Commission's order was invalid or unreasonable. The Act did not allow a de novo review of the Commission's order but permitted additional evidence relating to procedural irregularities before the Commission. There was substantial evidence that the corporation violated the Commission's order. The final order allowed the corporation to charge the company for its proportionate use of the disposal pipeline system for the transportation of brine to the disposal well.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 23-52-101 to -117, and in finding the Act constitutional. Appellant class members appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The members argued that the trial court erred in determining that there was no illegal-exaction claim based on a misuse of public funds. The supreme court found that the Board established its entitlement to summary judgment through the affidavits of the Board's Executive Director. The director averred that the Board did not receive any revenue from state treasuries, had not used any public funds to finance its operations, and the funds used by the Board were not generated from tax dollars. The members failed to refute that evidence. In the absence of a valid illegal-exaction claim, it was proper for the trial court to dismiss the members' claim for declaratory judgment holding the Act unconstitutional because they were required to preserve such a claim in the first appeal. The members were not required to first seek a declaration regarding the constitutionality of the Act before the Board. The members properly sought a declaration in circuit court that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court found that the claims were barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Workers' Compensation Act (WCA), specifically Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-105.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employer contended that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to determine the applicability of the WCA.

The court held that the determination was exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Workers' Compensation Commission. Even though the case raised a constitutional issue and the Commission might not have authority to declare statutes unconstitutional, the issues had to be raised first at the Commission level because such issues required an exhaustive analysis that was best accomplished by an adversary proceeding, which could only be done at the administrative hearing level. The court further found that the facts presented were not so one-sided so as to demonstrate that the WCA did not apply as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a minister, was convicted for sexually assaulting two victims, who attended and worked for defendant's church. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because the testimony of the victims did not indicate a consensual relationship: (1) both victims testified that they looked up to defendant as a minister and trusted him; (2) one victim testified that she was afraid of what might happen to her if she did not comply with sexual requests; (3) the victim testified that she was not attracted to defendant; (4) and the second victim testified that she told defendant that because he was a minister, sex was not right. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenges to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-126(a)(1)(B) (Repl. 2006). The court further held that there was sufficient evidence that the crime against one victim occurred in 2002, and therefore was within the three-year statute of limitations of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-109(b)(2) (Repl. 2006) as she testified that the assault happened while she was working for the church during the summer of 2002.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The supreme court disagreed. The facts revealed that defendant informed the property owner that there were a large number of pine beetles on the property and that he was losing a lot of trees. According to defendant, the owner told him to &quot;go ahead and do what you think needs to be done. Treat it like your own.&quot; After that conversation, defendant used a bulldozer to make roads throughout the property and then began to harvest the trees. While the property was on the market, a certified forester inspected the land and discovered that a very large percentage of the property had been recently logged. An investigator examined the property and determined that the entire 300 acres had been cut over. In addition, the owner found a handwritten &quot;no trespassing&quot; sign placed on the property -- on the reverse was a sign for defendant's timber company. Defendant admitted cutting the timber. The jury was not obligated to believe that defendant was acting under -- what he believed was -- the owner's consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient and his wife filed a medical malpractice case against the physician based on a pulmonary embolism. The physician gave the documents to her office staff, but they never reached an in-house attorney. A default judgment was entered, and damages were awarded. Thereafter, the physician sought to have the default judgment set aside. The trial court denied the request, and the physician sought review. In partially affirming, the appellate court determined that the physician's failure to file an answer was not the result of excusable neglect under Ark. R. Civ. P. 55(c) (2005). She did nothing to ensure that a defense was being mounted on her behalf. The fact that a meritorious defense existed did not mean that the default judgment was set aside, unless one of the grounds under Rule 55(c) was shown. Also, nothing in Rule 55 required the trial court to provide notice to the physician regarding the hearing on damages. Because notice and an opportunity for a hearing had been provided, due process was not violated. However, there was insufficient evidence to support the $500,000 damage award because the testimony was largely speculative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court rejected the inmate's claims that the State knowingly introduced false testimony in order to bolster its theory of the case and that the information charging him with capital murder was defective on the ground that it failed to enumerate any of the four aggravating circumstances upon which the State relied to obtain the death penalty because the claims could have been raised on direct appeal but were not, and could not be raised for the first time in a Rule 37 petition. The inmate's claims pertaining to a juror's alleged untruthfulness during voir dire concerning his feelings about the death penalty were not cognizable in his postconviction proceeding. The inmate waived any error that may have arisen from the sheriff's acting as a witness in his case and as the bailiff because he failed to raise the issue on direct appeal and because the State and defense counsel agreed for the sheriff to remain in the courtroom in exchange for the defense team to be able to keep its investigators in the courtroom as well.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, the Arkansas Department of Human Services and the Child Agency Review Board, sought review of a decision of the Pulaski County Circuit Court, Sixth Division (Arkansas), which ruled that &sect; 200.3.2 of the Minimum Licensing Standards for Child Welfare Agencies (Regulation 200.3.2) violated the separation of powers doctrine and was unconstitutional. Appellants filed a cross-appeal with additional constitutional challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Regulation 200.3.2 disqualified individuals from becoming foster parents if any adult member of that individuals' household was a homosexual. The circuit court ruled that the regulation violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court determined initially that appellees had standing to bring the lawsuit. Appellees were within the class of persons affected by the regulation and each appellees' attempt to become a foster parent would have been futile. Appellees were not required to exhaust administrative remedies because they could challenge the validity of Regulation 200.3.2 pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-15-207(2002) with a declaratory judgment action. The court found that Regulation 200.3.2 did nothing to promote the health, safety, or welfare of foster children as required by regulations promulgated pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. 9-28-405(2002). Rather Regulation 200.3.2 improperly excluded a set of individuals from becoming foster parents based upon the Board's morality and bias. The General Assembly did not delegate the legislative power to the Board to address issues of morality, and Regulation 200.3.2 thus violated the separation-of-powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the decision of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner was convicted in the Arkansas County Circuit Court, Southern District (Arkansas) of two counts of aggravated assault, one count of criminal mischief, and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. After his request for postconviction relief was denied, the petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner argued, inter alia, that counsel was ineffective in failing to request a severance of the felon-in-possession charge. The supreme court agreed. The circuit court did not hold a hearing on the petition for post-conviction relief. Consequently, the record provided no insight as to why counsel failed to file a motion for severance. Without such evidence in the record, it could not be presumed that counsel's failure to request severance of the felon-in-possession charge fell within the category of a tactical decision. An examination of the record revealed that the evidence of guilt was less than &quot;overwhelming.&quot; A witness testified on behalf of the petitioner, stating that the gun found at the residence was her gun and that a friend had shown her how to shoot the gun earlier that day. She further testified that she did not see the petitioner with a gun. The complainant testified repeatedly that she was drunk at the time of the incident and so could not be sure of any of the details. Most notably, her testimony was even inconsistent regarding whether or not she actually heard a gunshot. Both complainants testified that it was not uncommon to hear gunshots in the area.</SPAN></P>

The agency also agreed to pay the individual's attorney's fees and an additional $ 44,225 to settle her claim. The individual filed the present action in the district court and alleged that the company and its owner were liable as &quot;designer, manufacturer, component part supplier, and/or seller&quot; of the machine that caused the individual's injury. The appellate court reversed the grant of summary judgment as it held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to consider the issue under Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;11-9-105(a) (Supp. 1995). The appellate court held that the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission had exclusive, original jurisdiction to determine whether the company was an employer and immune from suit under the Workers' Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant cigarette wholesaler sued appellee Arkansas Tobacco Control Board, contending that amendments made to the Arkansas Unfair Cigarette Sales Act, Ark. Code. Ann. &sect; 4-75-701 et seq. (2005), by Act No. 627, Ark. Acts 2003, rendered the Act unconstitutional under the due process provisions of Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 8 and the Fourteenth Amendment. The Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) dismissed the complaint; the wholesaler appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An amendment to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-702(1) and (5)(B) altered the cost to wholesalers by increasing the presumed &quot;cost of doing business&quot; from two and three-fourths' percent to four percent of the basic cost of the cigarettes to a wholesaler. The wholesaler argued that this change made the statutory presumption of predatory intent arising from below-cost sales under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-708(e) arbitrary and capricious and therefore unconstitutional. The high court held that the Act, as amended, afforded the wholesaler due process. There was a rational basis for the amendment of the presumed cost of doing business, as the legislature could have found that changed market conditions supported an increase in the cost of doing business. The amendment to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-702(5)(B) merely clarified where and what type of proof a wholesaler had to file in order to make a below-cost sale of cigarettes. The anti-rebate provisions in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-708(e) had a rational basis and were thus constitutional; because rebates made it more difficult to enforce and administer the Act, the legislature may have decided to prohibit them.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that appellants had standing to raise the issue of the exclusiveness of the AGFC's authority under Ark. Const. amend. 35, even in the absence of the AGFC as a party. Further, by virtue of Amendment 35, the AGFC did not have the power to prevent the destruction, manipulation, or alteration of natural resources, including streams and rivers, when such changes to those resources would allegedly have a collateral impact on wildlife or wildlife resources. The trial court correctly found that the responsibilities of the ASWCC under the project did not constitute the type of management or control of the wildlife resources of the State of Arkansas that was reserved to the AGFC under Amendment 35, &sect; 1, but rather involved a federal project and a navigable river where the role of the ASWCC was principally one of funding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee employee was fired as an assessor with appellant county and filed suit for breach of contract, wrongful termination, violation of the Arkansas Whistle-Blower Act (Act), Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-1-601-609 (2003), and outrage. A quorum court held that she should be reinstated, but she was terminated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The jury found in favor of the employee and awarded damages. The Arkansas Court of Appeals affirmed the breach of contract verdict and affirmed the order of the trial court directing a verdict on the outrage claim and denying the motion for attorney's fees. It reversed the order directing a verdict on the claim under the Whistle-Blower Act. On cross-appeal the employee argued that the trial court erred in granting the motion for a directed verdict on her claim under the Act. Pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 21-1-604(c), the employee had to establish that she suffered an adverse action because she engaged or intended to engage in an activity protected under the Act. The issue was whether the employee's actions of reporting the alleged misdeeds to quorum court members constituted reporting to the &quot;appropriate authorities.&quot; Because the quorum court was vested with the legislative power of the county and under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 21-1-602(2)(A)(ii) reporting could be made to a member of a governing body, the evidence submitted by the employee regarding her reporting of the alleged misdeeds to quorum court members created a question of fact that should have been resolved by the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court's grant of the county's motion for directed verdict regarding the Whistle-Blower Act was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial on the employee's claim under the Act. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects. The court of appeals was affirmed. The employee's motion for imposition of attorney fees and costs was granted.</SPAN></P>

The mother relinquished her parental rights and consented to the adoption of the baby. On December 14, 2004, the putative father was served with a summons, petition for adoption, notice of hearing, and notice of deposition. The requirements of due process were satisfied. A DNA test showed that he was the child's biological father, but he did not timely register with the putative-father registry. His consent to the adoption was not required by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-9-206(a)(2) (Repl. 2002). He had not &quot;otherwise legitimated&quot; the child pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-9-206(a)(2).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee judge filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against appellant, the Secretary of State for the State of Arkansas, asserting that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-104 (Supp. 2005) was unconstitutional. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The Pulaski County Circuit Court, Arkansas, granted summary judgment, and it found the statute to be unconstitutional, void, and of no effect. The Secretary appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judge was appointed to the position of circuit court judge. Subsequent to her appointment, the act became effective. To support her motion for summary judgment, the judge filed an affidavit indicating that had she known that she would be ineligible to run for another circuit judge position, she would not have accepted the appointment. The Secretary argued that the act was constitutional, in that it was a valid exercise of the General Assembly's authority over the creation and regulation of judicial districts and divisions to deny the advantages of incumbency to judges who were not elected. Nevertheless, the supreme court determined that the Secretary's reliance on Ark. Const. amend. 29 was unavailing. Contrary to the Secretary's argument, it was not apparent that the purpose behind the amendment was to deny the advantages of incumbency to an appointed judge. Amendment 29 prevented a person from succeeding himself or herself in the specific position to which he or she was appointed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The newspaper sought a writ of certiorari directing the judge to dissolve an injunction that prevented it from reporting testimony given in open court during a pretrial hearing in a case involving a dispute between a mayor and a city council. In the case, the mayor had testified that the judge had initiated an improper ex parte conversation with him. The court agreed that the restraining order was too broad and was an unconstitutional prior restraint on the press. The proceeding concerned an issue of great public interest and concern. Although the court was sensitive to the concerns raised by the judge, it found that they were insufficient to counterbalance the public interest in the knowledge of what had transpired at judicial proceedings that were open to the public. The reasons for the restraining order advanced by the judge were insufficient to justify its breadth or to justify the suppression of the testimony given by the mayor. Once the mayor gave his testimony in open court, the judge could not undo what had been done by attempting to suppress the testimony after the fact. Therefore, the restraining order constituted a plain, manifest, clear, and gross abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Finally, defendant's claim that &sect; 5-27-221 was unconstitutionally vague was rejected because the conduct proscribed by the statute was a &quot;failure to take action to prevent abuse.&quot; If abuse was occurring, and defendant was aware of that abuse, she was criminally liable if she did nothing to prevent further abuse. In this case, there was evidence that defendant was aware of the abuse; there was also evidence that the abuse continued to occur after defendant acknowledged her awareness of it, including testimony that defendant permitted the abuse to continue because she &quot;needed a babysitter.&quot; This evidence indicated that defendant failed to act to prevent the abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant taxpayer challenged a judgment of the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) that dismissed his suit against appellees, the Economic Development of Arkansas Fund Commission, and grant recipient businesses. The taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of two appropriation bills, 1997 Ark. Acts 413 and 672, and alleged that all appropriations made under the bills constituted illegal exactions in violation of Ark. Const. art. V, &sect; 29.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer claimed that because the Acts were unconstitutional, the appropriations or grants made by the Economic Development Commission were misappropriations of public funds. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees on the ground that appellees acted in good faith by relying on legislative acts that were presumed to be valid. On appeal, the taxpayer claimed illegal-exaction claims were not subject to defenses of good faith. The court adopted the reasoning of other jurisdictions that had adopted the rule that penalties should not be imposed on private parties for acts done in accordance with a law valid at the time the acts were performed but later held to be unconstitutional. The court held that statutes were presumed to be constitutional, and should not punish state officials or citizens for doing likewise. The court noted that in the five-year span between the filing of the lawsuit and the trial court's order, the Commission had been abolished and all monies appropriated through the Commission were spent. Thus, neither injunctive relief nor restitution were proper remedies and the taxpayer's claims were moot and the trial court did not err in so ruling.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Pulaski County, Arkansas, granted the commission's and the utilities' motions to dismiss. The customer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On review, the customer contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in finding that the commission had jurisdiction to resolve her claims. The supreme court disagreed, finding first that it had already decided in a prior decision the constitutionality and legality of the commission's action and that the relief the customer was seeking was a refund for the amount of the surcharge she paid. Further, the surcharge was collected by the utilities, not the commission, and the commission had primary jurisdiction to mandate monetary refunds under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-3-119(d) (2002). The customer's labeling of her claim as a tort did not automatically deprive the commission of authority to hear the complaint. And, contrary to the customer's assertion, the surcharges were not a tax; they were a mechanism by which the utilities could recover some of the bad debt incurred as a result of the implementation of the policy. As such, the customer did not have a valid illegal exaction claim. The supreme court's conclusion in the prior decision that the surcharge was unlawful did not make it any less of a rate while it was being charged and collected by the utilities.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed that early-childhood education was a program that it could mandate to be funded at a certain level. If an adequate curriculum, adequate facilities, and adequate equipment could not be afforded to the school children in the smaller school districts due to a lack of sufficient economic resources, more efficient measures to afford that adequacy was inevitable. Neither the Masters nor the supreme court could gauge and assess the steps to be undertaken to mandate adequate and substantially equal facilities and equipment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The districts moved to strike defendants' post-Masters' Report brief, specifically seeking to strike the State's arguments regarding justiciability and the separation of powers. The second motion filed asked the supreme court to take judicial notice of certain items filed in federal district court relating to the Pulaski County desegregation case. The supreme court rejected the State's argument and found that its refusal to review school funding under Ark. Const. art. 14, &sect; 1 would be a complete abrogation of its judicial responsibility and would serve a severe disservice to the people of Arkansas. It viewed the governor and senators and representatives as dedicated public servants who were striving to meet the educational goals of the state. The supreme court agreed with the Masters' finding that the General Assembly did not comply with 2003 Ark. Acts 57. In connection with facilities funding, appropriations for the construction and repair for safe, dry, and healthy facilities were grossly underfunded and, thus, inadequate. The mandate was stayed until December 1, 2006, to allow the necessary time to correct the constitutional deficiencies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The motion to strike the State's brief was denied, and the motion to take judicial notice was denied; the issuance of the mandate was stayed to allow the necessary time to correct constitutional deficiencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Sebastian County Circuit Court, Arkansas, granted judgment in favor of appellee business owner by finding that 1997 Ark. Acts 727, &sect; 2, as written, was unconstitutional and concluded that the words &quot;the Mississippi&quot; should be struck from the statute and substituted with the words &quot;a river.&quot; Appellant, Director of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The director argued that the trial court erred by declaring the classification created by 1997 Ark. Acts 727, &sect; 2, between border cities located on the Mississippi River and border cities that were not, violated the Arkansas and United States Constitution; and the trial court erred by declaring that the term &quot;the Mississippi&quot; should be struck from Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-55-211 and that the term &quot;a river&quot; should be substituted in its place. The appellate court found that it could conceive how granting the border city exemption to certain territory within the state, regardless of the date of annexation, might assist certain cities to compete with other cities. However, the classification that limited the application of the Act only to border cities along the Mississippi River, a small portion of the state, was not rationally related to that purpose. The Act was clearly local and special legislation in violation of Ark. Const. amend. 14. Allowing the trial court to broaden the scope of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-55-211 by extending the statute's application from only river border cities on the Mississippi to all river border cities would be an intrusion into the legislative domain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was affirmed as to the finding that the classification in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-55-211 was unconstitutional; the judgment was reversed where the trial court did not have the authority to substitute language within the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In plaintiff patient's medical malpractice suit against defendant physician and defendant hospital, the patient challenged the constitutionality of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-207(3) (1987). The Saline County Circuit Court, Arkansas, rejected the constitutional challenge. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient alleged negligence in the removal of lymph node masses because he severed a nerve during the process. She further alleged that the hospital was vicariously liable for the physician's negligent conduct. On appeal, the patient contended that &sect; 16-114-207(3) was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause in Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 3. She also claimed that the challenged statute was unconstitutional under Ark. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the patient argued that strict scrutiny was the appropriate standard of review, but she never made that argument below. As a result, rational-basis review was the test accepted and used by the circuit court in reaching its decision, and the issue was not preserved for appellate review. Applying the rational basis test, the supreme court concluded that the patient had offered no proof that the general assembly acted arbitrarily, or that the legislation was not rationally related to achieving a stated objective. The patient failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality. The supreme court did not address the patient's separation of powers argument.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. There was substantial evidence that defendant made sexual contact with the victim. The victim testified that defendant fondled her breast and digitally penetrated her. Further, defendant admitted that the allegations were true. There was substantial evidence that the victim was under eighteen years of age and that defendant was the victim's temporary caretaker on the night that he made sexual contact with her. Defendant was in a position of trust, as he was a family friend to whom the victim's parents entrusted her, and he was in a position to care for the victim while she spent the night at his house. Both the victim's mother and stepfather testified at trial that they trusted defendant to care for their daughter as they would. Therefore, defendant fulfilled the role of &quot;temporary caretaker.&quot; In addition, Ark.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2-16-601 to -617 (1996 and Supp. 2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The growers claimed that a referendum under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 2-16-614 was required before any assessment for an eradication program could be levied under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 2-16-610. The growers also challenged the constitutionality of the Act, claiming that the Board's actions resulted in their being treated differently from cotton growers in other zones that approved their assessments via referendum. The court held that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 2-16-610(b)(2) specifically authorized the Board to issue regulations requiring the growers to participate in and share the costs of an eradication program and that there was no limiting language in Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2-16-610 or 2-16-614 making the Board's authority dependent upon referendum approval. The court held there was no equal protection violation stemming from the fact that the Act authorized growers who elected to implement an eradication program to later elect to modify or recall that program because the Act created two separate means for eradication, one for the growers and one for the Board, but the Board's power was independent of any action taken by the growers. Thus, all growers were subject to the same authority.</SPAN></P>

The mother then sought lying-in expenses from the father, which included expenses for counseling, room and board, maternity clothes, schooling expenses, lost income, travel and telephone expenses, and medical expenses paid by the adoptive parents. The trial court denied certain expenses. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that under Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The insured suffered a fire loss on her residence. Shortly thereafter, the property was foreclosed upon by a mortgagee. The insurer paid the proceeds of the insurance policy to the mortgagee. The insured then sought to recover payment under the policy. After her motion for partial summary judgment was granted, the insurer sought review. On appeal, the court determined that the insurer lacked standing to challenge the foreclosure proceeding based on the mortgagee's lack of knowledge of the fire damage. The insurer was not a party to the mortgage or a third-party beneficiary. Because the insurer's only interest was to pay the insurance proceeds to the rightful owner, it had no interest in the foreclosure itself. Other arguments related to the foreclosure were deemed meritless or the insurer failed to cite any authority to support its position. The trial court erred in awarding fees and penalties under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-79-208. The record did not support the argument that the insurer failed to pay. The fact that the amount awarded was within 20 percent of the amount demanded was of no significance because the amount awarded was the exact amount tendered and rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State argued that evidence seized during an inventory pursuant to the impoundment of defendant's car for failure to provide proof of insurance was lawful, and that the circuit court erred in granting defendant's motion to suppress. The State argued that while Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 27-22-104 did not specifically provide for the impoundment of a motor vehicle that lacked proof of valid insurance, it did specifically prohibit it. The appellate court determined that the statute called for the officer to impound only the vehicle's license plate, not the car, in the event the driver was unable to present proof of insurance. Ark. R. Crim. P. 12.6 did not authorize the impoundment of a vehicle, but merely the search after a car had been properly impounded or retained. Without some independent and proper basis for the impoundment itself, the authorization to search pursuant was inapplicable. The statute required the officer to remove and impound the license plate. While both officers testified that defendant's insurance card was expired, other witnesses testified that the car was insured. Neither officer had any record at all of what they discovered in their search of defendant's vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court's determination that Arkansas' public school funding system did not pass constitutional muster dated back 22 years. The supreme court was determined not to waver in its commitment to the goal of an adequate and substantially equal education for all Arkansas students.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A county court held that appellant county violated the civil rights of county taxpayers under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Appellee citizen then asserted a right to damages in the Pulaski County Circuit Court, Arkansas. The circuit court denied the county's motion to dismiss based on a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and granted the citizen's motion for summary judgment. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The citizen first asserted that the appeal had to be dismissed because the notice of appeal was not filed within 30 days of the circuit court's order allowing for damages. However, the order referred to an attached letter opinion. In that letter opinion, the circuit court stated that damages were yet to be assessed. The Arkansas Supreme Court had on numerous occasions held that for an order to be final, it had to establish the amount of damages. To the extent that Hartwick v. Hill, 73 S.W. 3d 15 (2002), was inconsistent thereon, it was overruled. A subsequent order directing payment of damages was the first order that definitively set out the damages. The county's appeal from that order was timely. However, the county court (any county court), lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over claims of violation of the federal constitution (in the case at bar, deprivation of constitutional rights), and its judgment in that regard was null and void. Jurisdiction of a county court was limited to those subjects set forth in Ark. Const. art. VII, &sect; 28. The citizen was basing her action in circuit court on a void order from the county court. Thus, the circuit court's judgment was also void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">There was no valid judgment from the county court for the circuit court to enforce regarding the claims of civil rights violations. The judgment of the circuit court is void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) that convicted him of possession of pseudoephedrine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, manufacture of a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, and maintaining a drug premises, and that sentenced him to 30 years in prison and a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant claimed the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because he was illegally seized during a knock-and-talk procedure by police after he refused consent to search his home and was denied reentry into his home for four hours. The court found that police went to defendant's home to question him about manufacturing methamphetamine based on an informant's tip. Defendant denied consent to search but a guest at the house came out and confirmed that there were drugs and paraphernalia inside. The court held that the informant's tip, coupled with the guest's information, gave police probable cause to believe the house contained evidence of a crime. The officers also reasonably believed that defendant would destroy the evidence if not restrained. Thus, the court held that the limited restraint of defendant for a short time did not violate the Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 15 or the Fourth Amendment. The court noted that defendant's home was not searched until a search warrant was obtained and held that defendant's motion to dismiss the possession with intent to manufacture charges was properly denied because they were not lesser-included offenses of the manufacturing offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Sebastian County Circuit Court (Arkansas) dismissed a medical negligence claim filed by appellant, the administrator of the estate of the decedent. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss that had been filed by appellee doctors and a medical center claiming that the statute of limitations had run on the suit. The administrator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The administrator argued that the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss, and challenged the constitutionality of the statute of limitations under the Medical Malpractice Act, codified at Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-201 et seq., (1987 and Supp. 2003). The issue was whether the cause of action was barred by the medical-malpractice statute of limitations in a wrongful-death action. The cause of action was controlled by the 2-year medical malpractice statute of limitations set forth in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-203. Under &sect; 16-114-203(a), all actions for medical injury shall be commenced within 2 years after the cause of action accrued. Under &sect; 16-114-203(b), the date of the accrual of the cause of action shall be the date of the wrongful act complained of and no other time. The alleged negligence occurred on January 26, 2001, when the chest x-ray, which allegedly showed an aortic aneurysm, was read by a doctor as &quot;clear.&quot; The other doctor's alleged negligence occurred on January 29, 2001, when he noted that there was &quot;no acute disease.&quot; The complaint was filed on February 25, 2004, which was 3 years past the date of the alleged misreadings of the deceased's chest x-rays.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The father had sole custody of his son, who was less than two years old when the stepmother moved in with them. When the father and stepmother divorced, the father was granted full custody of the child, with limited visitation awarded to the stepmother. It was held that the stepmother had stood in loco parentis to the child since he was 18 months old. The lower court upheld the decision. On review, the court found that the father admitted that he had described the stepmother as the child's mother in both conversations and in writing. He also acknowledged that he had executed powers of attorney for the stepmother so that she could get medical care for the child when he was away in the military. The stepmother was the only mother that the child had ever known, and he did not know she was not his birth mother until first grade. She had served as his mother for six years. She described herself as the child's mother; he called her &quot;mommy.&quot; The fact that she told the father that one of the reasons she left was because she was a nanny, rather than a wife or mother, appeared to have had more to do with her impression of her relationship with the father than with the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of murder in the Pulaski County Circuit Court, First Division (Arkansas), and sentenced to death. Upon reconsidering defendant's motion for relief under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37, the circuit court concluded that defendant's penalty-phase counsel was ineffective for failing to object to evidence of a prior conviction for battery and granted defendant a new sentencing hearing. The State appealed, and defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant claimed that his counsel's failure to object to the introduction of evidence of a first-degree-battery conviction constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Three justices argued that counsel's assistance was not ineffective because, the evidence showed, defendant had in fact been convicted of battery. A majority of the court, however, affirmed the grant of a new sentencing hearing. Their opinion was that the State had not argued that counsel was effective, merely that defendant was not prejudiced, and that the court could not reverse on an argument that the State had not made. The court affirmed the circuit court's rejection of defendant's other ineffective assistance claims, finding that his counsel's failure to present allegedly mitigating evidence of defendant's alcoholism and violent family history was strategic.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A divided court affirmed the circuit court's finding that a new sentencing hearing was warranted based on the admission of a prior battery conviction and affirmed the circuit court's denial of relief on defendant's other claims of ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 17-81-303(a)(1) (2002). The Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) affirmed. The therapist sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The therapist was not a licensed chiropractor. Two of his patients testified that he manipulated their spines in a manner similar to that of their chiropractors, causing their spines to &quot;pop.&quot; An expert testified that the popping sounds indicated that the therapist manipulated the patients' spines by moving them outside of their normal range of motion; under &sect; 17-81-303(a)(1) of the Arkansas Chiropractic Practices Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-81-101 et seq. (2002), only chiropractors could perform &quot;spinal manipulations,&quot; as defined in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-81-102(7). The appellate court, noting that the credibility and weight of the evidence was within the Board's discretion, found that the evidence was sufficient to support the Board's decision, and that it made the requisite findings of fact under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-15-210(b)(2) (2002). The therapist's actions did not fall under the Act's &quot;physical therapy exemption,&quot; Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-81-302(3), as physical therapy was defined in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-93-102(6) as passive movement within the joint's normal range of motion, &quot;excluding spinal manipulation.&quot; The therapist's constitutional argument was not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

In 2003, the suspended portion of the term of imprisonment was revoked because petitioner had failed to comply with the conditions of the suspended sentence. He was sentenced to serve 36 months' imprisonment. The revocation order was upheld on appeal. In 2004, petitioner filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petition was denied. On appeal, petitioner sought an extension of time to file his brief. The court determined that it did not need to consider the motion for an extension of time because it was apparent that petitioner could not prevail in the appeal if it was permitted to go forward because he failed to demonstrate a ground for the writ. None of his claims were sufficient to establish that his commitment was invalid on its face or that the trial court was without jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The divorce decree purportedly set forth all of the parties' properties and indebtedness and divided those properties and debts between appellant ex-husband and appellee ex-wife. The wife subsequently filed a motion in which she alleged the husband had committed fraud during their divorce proceeding and asked the Circuit Court of Pulaski County (Arkansas) to divide the disputed stock, which the trial court did. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court determined that, at the time of the divorce, the husband introduced into evidence a statement of net worth which failed to disclose his ownership of the shares of the disputed stock. The husband never denied that his responses to the wife's discovery requests omitted the disputed stock and that he failed to supplement his discovery responses. In addition, the husband neither denied that his statement of net worth at the time of the divorce omitted the disputed stock, nor did he deny that he presented false testimony by stating his statement of worth was complete. Thus, the trial court did not err in ruling that the husband had committed fraud. The supreme court found that the wife's proof of constructive fraud was sufficient to reopen the divorce under Ark. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(4). Additionally, because the supreme court amended Rule 60(c)(4), to supply a new or more appropriate remedy to enforce an existing right and obligation in order to avoid unjust results, the amendment to Rule 60(c)(4) was remedial in nature and appropriately applied retroactively. Thus, the trial court did not err in modifying the divorce decree where the wife only showed intrinsic fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supreme court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The surety provided a bond for a payday lender. The individual brought an action against the surety seeking release of the bond to satisfy a judgment that she had previously won against the payday lender.

The individual moved for summary judgment. The trial court denied the surety's motion to dismiss and granted the motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the case because the individual failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. It was not futile to require the individual to exhaust her administrative remedies before proceeding with her claim in court, even though the Board ruled against her on a similar claim. She failed to demonstrate with certainty that the Board's decision would be the same in the current case. By skipping the crucial step before the Board, the individual deprived the agency of the opportunity to correct any mistakes that it might have made in the previous case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant taxpayers filed a suit against appellees, the Arkansas State Board of Collections Agencies and associated individuals, maintaining that all transactions under the Check-Casher's Act (Act), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-52-101 et seq., involved interest rates that violated the usury provisions of Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 13.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers argued that the circuit court not only erred in dismissing the case, but also in determining that it could not rule on the constitutional issue and in failing to grant their partial summary-judgment motion. The appellate court found that the circuit court erred when it found that the claim was barred by an unrelated administrative claim, where only one person filed the administrative complaint and the issues were not the same. The pendency of the administrative process did not prevent the taxpayers from filing a new and separate cause of action for illegal exaction. The taxpayers' allegations that all plaintiffs were Arkansas residents and taxpayers were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss for lack of standing. The complaint sufficiently stated a cause of action for illegal exaction. The misapplication of public funds was one avenue for establishing a claim for illegal exaction. Because the taxpayers successfully pled an illegal exaction claim, the doctrine of sovereign immunity was not applicable. All licensed check-cashers in Arkansas would be members of the class and parties to the illegal exaction suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After defendant was convicted, he was ordered to submit to DNA testing under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-12-1109(a) (2003). He contended that this requirement violated his Fourth Amendment rights. In affirming, the court adopted the totality of the circumstances test to determine if the DNA collection statute constituted an unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The court noted that a felon's expectation of privacy was diminished. Moreover, the intrusion occasioned by a blood test was not significant on defendant's privacy and bodily integrity. In contrast, the State's interest in solving crimes was substantial. As such, the collection and maintenance of DNA samples was reasonable. Since defendant failed to show that the court's treatment of Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 15 in relation to searches in the penal context was inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment, no further analysis was required. Finally, the court found that there was no Fourth Amendment violation based on the right of privacy separate from the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner filed a motion to recall the mandate and reopen his case after a federal court dismissed his amended habeas corpus petition seeking relief from his capital murder and rape convictions and death sentence therefor. Petitioner claimed that he was mentally retarded and that his execution was barred under the United States Supreme Court's holding that execution of mentally retarded individuals violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The holding relied upon by petitioner came out after the mandate was issued, and the federal court in which petitioner filed his habeas petition held that the legal basis for his claim was unavailable to him during the state proceedings. However, the court held that petitioner could have availed himself of Ark Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-618(b) (Repl. 1997), which prohibited execution of mentally retarded defendants, but that he failed to do so. Petitioner never even presented evidence that he was mentally retarded, and a forensic psychologist testified that petitioner's score on an intelligence test did not indicate mental retardation. Thus, there was no merit to petitioner's contention that he could not have made his federal constitutional argument previously. In addition, petitioner's state court remedies with respect to postconviction relief had been exhausted, as he agreed with the assessment that there were no issues appropriate for such relief and the time for filing a petition was long since past. State habeas relief was not a proper avenue for petitioner, as the sentencing court possessed jurisdiction, and the sentence of death was not invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied petitioner's motion to recall the mandate and reopen his case, and it held that, because petitioner exhausted his right to assert a mental retardation defense in state court, he was left to pursue any such relief in the federal courts.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 26-37-301 (Repl. 1997) complied with the constitutional requirements of due process and granted appellee tax sale purchaser's and the tax commissioner's motions for summary judgment and denied appellant owners' motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owners argued that the trial court erred in ruling that the State was not required to locate their correct address after the tax-sale notices were returned to the State unclaimed, arguing that the trial court erred in ruling that the State's sale of their property was constitutional under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-37-301. They further argued that due process required the State to conduct a reasonable search of public records in an attempt to ascertain the husband's correct address before selling his property. The purchaser and the commissioner countered that an attempt to provide actual notice was all that was required in order to comply with the requirements of due process. The Supreme Court of Arkansas agreed. There was simply not a requirement in &sect; 26-37-301 that the State had to try to locate the correct address of a delinquent taxpayer when a notice was returned unclaimed. And such action was not required in order to comply with the constitutional dictates of due process. The State attempted to provide the owners with notice, both via certified mail and through publication in the newspaper and complied with the provisions of &sect; 26-37-301. The tax sale was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Cleburne County Circuit Court, Arkansas, reversed the findings of appellant Arkansas Hearing Instrument Dispenser Board and concluded that there was not substantial evidence to support the Board's findings of violations of two standards of conduct and that the disciplinary procedures violated the rights of appellee dispenser to due process. The Board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appellate court's inquiry was whether there was substantial evidence to supporting the findings. Based upon the testimony of the customer, there was substantial evidence to support the findings of fact that the dispenser, in making a sale to the customer, represented that she had to purchase a hearing instrument on January 12th to receive the discount from the coupon that was valid until January 13th. The customer testified that she continued to experience problems with her instruments, and after three trips to the dispenser's office within one week, she went to a doctor who wrote a letter stating that the hearing instruments were causing ulcers in her left ear. There was not insufficient evidence upon which the Board could base its findings of fact. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-84-101 made it clear that there was ample guidance for the reasonable person in determining whether a course of conduct was ethical or unethical under the statutes. The dispenser did not offer any authority for his proposition that the statute regulated a fundamental right. The statute was given greater leeway in a constitutional challenge for vagueness as it was a statute that regulated business activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The circuit court's judgment was reversed; the judgment of the Board was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff booksellers brought suit before the United States District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas, against defendant state prosecuting attorneys. The complaint sought to enjoin the enforcement of, and to declare facially unconstitutional and void, the newly amended portions of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-68-502 (amended 2003). The federal district court certified questions, asking for a statutory interpretation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-68-502 (amended 2003) required material deemed &quot;harmful to minors&quot; to be obstructed from view and physically segregated. The question put forth by the district court was whether the statute intended to protect all minors from exposure to materials harmful to minors? The supreme court answered in the affirmative. The next question was whether a bookseller or librarian allowed a minor to view any material that was harmful to minors by simply shelving and displaying such material? If material harmful to minors was shelved on a bookshelf, even without some other effort made to draw attention to it, it was displayed within the meaning of the statute. Even if a book only had &quot;harmful&quot; content, but not a &quot;harmful&quot; cover, the bookseller could still be subject to prosecution, if that book were not obstructed from view and physically segregated. The booksellers were allowed to choose the method best suited to their individual establishments; it remained for the federal court to ultimately determine whether the First Amendment rights of booksellers, librarians, and their adult customers were violated.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court vacated the writ of mandate and held that nothing in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 7-8-302(5)(B) (Supp. 2003) required appellants to use a form contained in the 2004 Candidate Information handbook published by the Arkansas Secretary of State's Office. More importantly, there was no requirement that petitioners declared their intention to actually vote for the candidate on the petition. To make such a requirement would cause the provision to be unconstitutional, as it would infringe upon the fundamental civil liberty of the secret ballot. Thus, the Secretary of State's office was ordered to certify the ballots with the names of the Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In the trial court's order, the court noted that fees could be granted under Ark.

It also noted that although the mother argued that disparity in income should require a grant of fees, that reason alone was not a basis for an award of attorney's fees. The court, in evaluating the services of the mother's counsel, stated that beyond complex financial issues, the case presented straight forward legal issues. The mother argued that a showing of bias in the case prior to filing a motion for attorney's fees was relevant to show bias and an abuse of discretion in the decision on the fees. The appellate court considered every allegation of bias she argued. The trial court found the billings were inadequate and some were inflated. Examples of deficiencies were given in the order. The trial court was of the opinion that counsel's billings were unreliable, that too much time was spent on a number of types of items, and that counsel exhibited a lack of expertise.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant inmate appealed a judgment by the Jefferson County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which denied his petition for a declaratory judgment; the inmate claimed, inter alia, that he was entitled to parole pursuant to Act no. 50, Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the inmate was convicted of murder and battery, he was twice convicted of escape and other crimes. The state supreme court held that the inmate's parole eligibility was determined by the law in effect at the time the crime was committed. Pursuant to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43-2807(b)(1) (Supp. 1971), the inmate would become eligible for parole after having served one-third of the time to which his life sentence was commuted to a term of years by executive clemency. Because executive clemency was denied, the inmate was not eligible for parole. Because Act no. 50, Ark. Acts 1968 did not change the inmate's parole eligibility, it was not being unconstitutionally applied as an ex post facto law. Accordingly, the trial court did not error in denying the inmate's petition for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Sebastian County Circuit Court (Arkansas) convicted defendant of two counts of aggravated robbery and one count of capital murder. He was sentenced to two life sentences running consecutively for the aggravated-robbery charges and life without parole for the capital-murder charge. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The evidence was sufficient to establish defendant caused the victim's death under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. Defendant admitted pointing a loaded gun at the victim in the course of a robbery. Such conduct by itself constituted a manifestation of extreme indifference. Also, he fired a gun at an unarmed victim from less than three feet away, further indicating extreme indifference. He repeatedly threatened to shoot all three victims throughout the ordeal. He used a gun to shoot the victim at close range and admitted the shooting was intentional. He not only cursed the victim as he died, but threatened the other victims and locked them in a room so he could get away. These actions were sufficient to show premeditation and deliberation. Defendant's own statements provided enough evidence to sustain his conviction for aggravated robbery, as he admitted to having the purpose to commit felony theft, employing and threatening to employ force on his victims, and using a gun during the robbery. There was a presumption that the model instruction was a correct statement of the law, and defendant cited no authority sufficient to overcome it.</SPAN></P>

However, this specific argument was not made to the circuit court as part of defendant's motions for directed verdict. Thus, the matter was not preserved for appellate review. The appellate court could not address defendant's argument that the circuit court erred in convicting him of arson, because it was a lesser-included offense of capital murder.

Dist. No. 25 v. Huckabee, known as Lakeview IIII.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The common theme throughout much of the oral arguments was that if the court did not serve as a &quot;watchdog&quot; agency to assure full compliance with Lake View III, the General Assembly would fully implement what it had already begun to ensure equal education to both poor and wealthy school districts within Arkansas as required by Ark. Const. art. 14, &sect; 1. The court referred the case to Masters to determine what legislative and administrative action had been taken to comply with Lake View III. The Masters filed a summary of an Adequacy Study commissioned by the General Assembly that focused on school finance, teacher compensation, and accountability, and concluded that it was thorough in its approach. The Masters then detailed the significant legislation that had been enacted to implement and fund the recommendations of the Adequacy Study and the rules adopted by the Department of Education to implement the legislation. The court accepted the Masters' report and released its jurisdiction of the case but held that it would exercise the power and authority of the judiciary at any time to achieve the goal of an adequate and substantially equal education for all Arkansas students.</SPAN></P>

The court further found that the attorney had numerous opportunities to address the scheduling conflict, but chose not to do so. The attorney waited until the last minute to address the situation. The trial judge was justified in finding the attorney in contempt. The court found no merit to the attorney's contention that the trial court failed to accord him his constitutional protections.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers, who lived in Louisiana and paid taxes in Arkansas, filed an illegal-exaction suit seeking a refund of taxes and asserting that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-51-301 (Supp. 1993) was unconstitutional in that it permitted individuals who were full-time Arkansas residents to use a reduced tax table in calculating income taxes. The trial court found that &sect; 26-51-301 was unconstitutional and that the taxpayers were entitled to a refund, as they had paid the taxes involuntarily. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in finding that the taxpayers' payments had been coerced and in failing to apply the voluntary-payment rule. The court noted that, under the rule, taxes paid voluntarily could not be recovered in an illegal-exaction suit and that taxes paid before the suit began were considered voluntary unless coerced. The court concluded that the taxpayers' payments were not coerced, because there was no evidence of the director's actual or threatened exercise of power in an attempt to collect the taxes, and the taxpayers had other reasonable means of relief.

The mother appealed, asserting that the trial court's award violated her liberty interest under the due process clause and that the Arkansas Great-Grandparents Visitation Act, 2003 Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">With respect to the Arkansas Great-Grandparents Visitation Act, 2003 Ark. Acts 652, the relevant provision at issue was Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-13-103 (Supp. 2003). However, the mother neither presented the trial court with the issue of the constitutionality of the statute, nor did she obtain a ruling on the issue. Therefore, the Arkansas Supreme Court declined to review the constitutionality of the grandparents visitation law. Secondly, the mother argued that, because no expert testimony was provided on the issue of harm to her daughter caused by denial of visitation, there was a lack of competent evidence. However, the mother cited no authority on that issue; therefore, this supreme court would not consider it on appeal. Finally, the mother argued that the trial court's decision on visitation was in error, because the great-grandparents failed to meet the burden of proof of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that loss of the relationship would harm the child. However, the cases the mother cited purportedly in support of the latter argument were not on point and were not convincing authority. Thus, the supreme court would not consider that issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee City of Jacksonville's petition for review of an appellate court (Arkansas) decision was granted. The appellate court decision reversed a circuit court order granting summary judgment in favor of the City and against appellants, a developer and his development company, in appellants' lawsuit seeking a declaration that an action by the City Council regarding a sidewalk ordinance was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The City's planning commission approved a preliminary plat for a subdivision development, and appellants commenced construction. The City then enacted a sidewalk ordinance, requiring sidewalks in all subdivisions. Appellants' development did not include sidewalks. The planning commission stipulated that it would not require appellants to include sidewalks as they were not practicable. The City Council disagreed with the stipulation and approved the final plat subject to appellants' constructing sidewalks. More than three months elapsed before appellants filed their declaratory judgment action against the City. Both sides filed motions for summary judgment. Appellants argued that the City Council acted ultra vires. The City argued that appellants' appeal was untimely under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-56-425. The circuit court agreed, as did the Arkansas Supreme Court. Prior case law precedent established that appellants were required to appeal the City Council's action within 30 days of the conditional plat approval. Having failed to do so, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The trial court's ruling did not impede the defense; it merely prevented questioning the victim with regard to her admission that she had sex with another person subsequent to the crime by defendant. The State contended that it was not necessary for defendant to expose the victim's subsequent sexual history in order to demonstrate her lack of credibility with regard to the claims she had made against defendant. The trial court excluded evidence of the prior sexual conduct, but it allowed defendant to argue that the victim was fabricating the allegations because she thought that defendant was too strict with her. Given the obvious potential that the evidence could be used to inflame the jury, the trial court conducted the appropriate balancing test and concluded that the prejudicial nature of the evidence outweighed its probative value.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee taxpayers filed a class action against appellant, the state department of finance and administration director, a city judge, and cities, challenging a use tax imposed by 1987 Ark. Acts 31. The Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) denied appellants' motion to dismiss the suit, finding that a prior judgment that the tax was valid had been rendered null and void by a subsequently decided case. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a prior case, taxpayers successfully challenged a compensating use tax imposed by the county based on voter approval of a sales tax. The state legislature later enacted 1987 Ark. Acts 31, which imposed a use tax at the same rate. Taxpayers then unsuccessfully challenged 1987 Ark. Acts 31. The taxpayers filed the instant suit challenging the tax again based on a subsequently decided case involving a sales tax. On appeal, the court held that the trial court should have granted appellants' motion to dismiss the instant challenge. The court held that the recently decided case addressed only ballot title issues and, therefore, had no effect on the previous challenge to 1987 Ark. Acts 31, which was not decided based on ballot title issues. Therefore, the prior decision finding 1987 Ark. Acts 31 valid was res judicata. None of the constitutional arguments addressed in the prior case were successful on appeal; hence, they could not be readjudicated. The same claims were raised in the instant action. Also, the prior suit was also brought by taxpayers, and its judgment bound all taxpayers. The fact that the collection period for the tax was different in the two suits was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant software user filed a notice of removal of a suit brought by appellee software designer. On September 30, 2002, the designer filed a motion for default judgment pursuant to Ark. R. Civ. P. 55(f). On October 4, 2002, the user filed a response to the motion for default judgment. The Crawford County Circuit Court (Arkansas) entered a default judgment following the order of remand from the federal court. The user appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The user contended that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the default judgment, because, under the amended version of Ark. R. Civ. P. 55(f), the designer was not entitled to entry of default judgment when an answer had been filed in federal court and the amended version of rule 55(f) should have been applied retroactively. The issue was whether the amended version of rule 55(f) should have been applied retroactively. In the instant case, the designer's right to request a default judgment was not enlarged or extinguished by the amendment to rule 55(f). The amendment to the rule merely outlined a new procedure that had to be followed before a party could obtain a default judgment after a case had been removed to federal court and then remanded back to the circuit court. Under either version of the rule, a plaintiff could request a default judgment. The change to the rule merely modified the standard by which default could be determined. Thus, the Supreme Court of Arkansas held that rule 55(f) was procedural and remedial and amended rule 55(f) should have been applied retroactively, because the user filed its answer in federal court on April 5, 2002.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The attorney's disbarment in 2000 was based on conduct from 1992 for which he had pleaded guilty to a felony charge relating to causing a bank to file a false currency-transaction report. The disbarment had been affirmed on appeal. In 2003, the attorney applied for readmission to the bar. In the instant action, the attorney challenged the Board's denial of that application without a hearing. The court affirmed. The court rejected the attorney's claim that applying Ark. Sup. Ct. Prof. Conduct P. &sect; 24 to him violated his due process rights. The court noted that admission to the bar was a privilege, not a right. Also, the court held that the five-year waiting period was not an enlargement of a punishment in violation of Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 8 and U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, as disbarment proceedings were neither criminal nor civil, the waiting period did not impose an affirmative disability, the attorney cited no authority indicating that a waiting period was a punishment, the waiting period was merely a procedural operation, and the five-year waiting period was not excessive.

Const. art. 4, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2, the separation of powers provisions. On appeal the court found no error. The court noted that defendant had no constitutional right to unilaterally waive a jury trial. Moreover, Ark. R. Crim. P. 31.1 and Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-89-108(a) (1987) required the approval of the prosecutor before a trial court could accept defendant's request to plead guilty and waive a jury trial. The court also rejected defendant's claim that Ark. R. Crim. P. 31.1 violated defendant's due process rights because it curtailed his liberty interest and exposed him to a higher sentence. The sentencing grid codified at Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-90-801 to -804 did not create a liberty interest in protecting defendant from exposure to the higher ranges of sentences. Rather, the purpose of the sentencing scheme was to assist judges who were required to do the sentencing due to guilty pleas or the inability of juries to agree on a sentence.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-701 et seq., prohibition against rebates was void for vagueness as applied to appellee retailer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At issue on appeal was the meaning of the terms &quot;trade discount&quot; and &quot;rebate.&quot; As the circuit court noted, neither term was defined in the statute. The ATCB chose to define &quot;rebate&quot; by regulation, but did not define &quot;trade discount.&quot; Wholesalers and retailers of tobacco, who were presumably professionals in their fields, professed confusion arising from the defined term and the undefined terms. The Supreme Court of Arkansas agreed that the terms &quot;trade discount&quot; and &quot;rebate&quot; were unclear under the existing UCSA and ATCB regulations as to what an allowed &quot;trade discount&quot; was, as opposed to a prohibited &quot;rebate.&quot; The supreme court held that the law was unconstitutionally vague under due process standards, because it did not give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what was prohibited, that was, of whether payments to the retailer were permitted &quot;trade discounts&quot; or prohibited &quot;rebates.&quot; The changes in the law in 2003 by the general assembly appeared to have been intended to cure some of the confusion giving rise to the instant appeal.

Because the father refused to comply with the order that was clearly within the trial court's jurisdiction and because the supreme court would not look behind the order for contempt purposes, the supreme court held that the father had not demonstrated that the trial court's finding of contempt against him was in error. The father alleged that he refused to comply with the trial court's visitation order because his son was being sexually abused by the grandmother. However, the trial court found that the allegations of sexual abuse were unsubstantiated. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying the father's petition to terminate the grandmother's visitation with the grandchildren and in finding him in contempt of the visitation order. Finally, the investigator's supervisor was properly allowed to testify regarding a police report that was made following the father's call to the sexual abuse hotline because her testimony did not run afoul of the hearsay rule.</SPAN></P>

Both defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The first defendant gave two recorded statements in which she admitted to being at the crime scene. In one of those statements, she told the police that she intended to kill the victim but was unable to muster the strength. She also acknowledged handing the murder weapon to the second defendant after he stated that he would kill the victim. Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the first defendant confessed to either murdering or aiding in the murder of the victim. In addition, the evidence reflected that the victim died as a result of a homicide. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict finding the first defendant guilty of first-degree murder. The supreme court condemned the practice of using dual juries and prohibited the use of dual juries in the future; however, because the supreme court could find no prejudice in defendants' case, it declined to reverse defendants' convictions on that point. But, the appellate court found that none of the officers informed the second defendant that he had the right to refuse consent to their entry and subsequent search of his home. Thus, all the evidence that flowed from that search should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the father relief. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court had denied the mother's constitutional challenge and allowed half-sibling visitation concurrent with the father's parental visitation rights with the parties' child.

Code Ann. &sect; 9-13-102 (Supp. 2002), the sibling visitation statute, was unconstitutional as written and as so applied. The appellate court noted that the liberty right of a parent to raise a child applied to both parents, and neither the state nor the absent parent had the right to intrude upon the decisions a fit parent made while the child in his or her custody, regarding what was in that child's best interest or with whom she could associate. The appellate court held that the father, during those visitation periods, had the right to decide what was in the child's best interest, including visitation between and among his daughters, in his own home, without being physically present. However, the appellate court concluded that the trial court clouded the issue of parental visitation rights by ordering concurrent sibling visitation rights under Ark.

The officer wrote up a warning, citing defendant for having a defective brake light. The officer also ran a criminal history check on both defendant and the passenger, which revealed that both men had prior drug arrests. The officer then brought a drug dog to the car. The officer's subsequent search of the car turned up 13 grams of cocaine. The Supreme Court of Arkansas held that defendant was entitled to have the evidence suppressed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant inmate was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death, and the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The inmate subsequently sought postconviction DNA testing under Act 1780, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-112-201-207 (Supp. 2003) and asserted claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37. The Sevier County Circuit Court, Arkansas, denied those petitions, as well as a motion to supplement. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the denial of DNA testing as to &quot;Caucasian&quot; hairs, reasoning that they were not tested at trial even though testing was available. Also, it was stipulated that the inmate, an African-American, was not the donor; thus, the jury knew there were hairs that belonged to someone else, and it still convicted him. The hairs thus were not materially relevant under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-112-202(c)(1)(B). Testing was also properly denied as to a cigarette butt, because prior retesting had decreased the probability of the saliva being from a different donor from 1 in 250 to 1 in 28 million. The court reversed the denial, however, as to retesting of &quot;Negroid&quot; hairs. The probability that they belonged to another African-American was only 1 in 250, a result that could have included thousands of people. The inmate made 13 other ineffective assistance of counsel claims, none of which met the Strickland test. Finally, the inmate was not entitled to supplement his petition to include an argument that victim impact procedure was inadequate in not requiring the jury to find proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Victim-impact statements were simply evidence, not an element in a statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the denial of the inmate's petition to retest the Negroid hairs and remanded for the circuit court to order DNA retesting. The court affirmed the remainder of the decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Three drug task force agents approached defendants' residence. They did so because of information received from two anonymous sources that defendants were involved in drug activity and that a child inside the residence had become ill due to drug manufacturing.

As a result of the search, defendants were charged with manufacture of methamphetamine and marijuana and possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver. The trial court granted defendants' two separate motions to suppress the evidence seized during the search. On appeal, the court held that the failure of the task force agents to advise the defendant who answered the door that she had the right to refuse consent to the search violated both defendants' rights against warrantless intrusions into the home, as guaranteed by Ark. Const. art. II, &sect; 15. The court explained that strong public policy in Arkansas in favor of privacy in one's home warranted its opinion.

The key to the jail in civil contempt rested in the hands of the contemnor and not a third party.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court granted partial summary judgment to appellees with regard to claimed &quot;loss of life&quot; damages, finding that at least some period of life between injury and death was a condition for recovery of loss-of-life damages by a decedent's estate. The administrators argued that no period of life between injury and death was required to recovery loss-of-life damages. The appellate court determined that, contrary to appellees' assertion, although damages for &quot;loss of life&quot; and &quot;loss of enjoyment of life&quot; were both hedonic, &quot;loss of life&quot; damages were not the equivalent of those for &quot;loss of enjoyment of life.&quot; The legislature allowed for the recovery of loss-of-life damages in the Arkansas survival statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-62-101, which made no distinction between &quot;personal injury&quot; and &quot;death&quot; when it spoke of the term &quot;injury.&quot; When a person was killed instantaneously, as was the decedent, her injury was her death, which was compensated by loss-of-life damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The bank holding company was formed under the Arkansas Business Corporation Act of 1987, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-27-101 et seq. The founders and the members had a dispute over whether they were required to use cumulative voting for electing directors. As a result, the founders filed a complaint seeking to invalidate the action taken by the members. When the trial court granted the members' motion for summary judgment, the founders sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the trial court did not err by denying a motion for a continuance and a stay under Ark. R. Civ. P. 56(f). There was no indication that the issues before the trial court necessitated any further inquiry into the surrounding facts and circumstances. Further, cumulative voting was not required because it was not mandated by the articles of incorporation. In addition, a bank holding company was not included within Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-48-320, which governed cumulative voting. Finally, the court determined that this interpretation of &sect; 23-48-320 was not unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ark. Const. art. 12, &sect; 6 allowed the Arkansas General Assembly to amend, alter, or repeal any law regarding corporations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant patient filed a medical malpractice suit against appellee doctor and a medical center. The complaint also named appellee, the center's insurer. The patient stated a belief that the center might claim immunity from suit for tort under the charitable immunity doctrine. The Circuit Court of Sebastian County (Arkansas) dismissed the insurer, basing its dismissal on the Clayborn decision. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient asked the Supreme Court of Arkansas to overrule Clayborn. Declining to overrule Clayborn, the court stated that it was a 2002 case involving both Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-79-210, the direct action statute, and the doctrine of charitable immunity. The supreme court did not agree with the patient's suggestion that, if Clayborn was allowed to stand, unjust results would follow. The patient argued that, if a hospital was &quot;immune from liability,&quot; its carrier would not be obligated to pay any damages that may accrue. However, the supreme court held that such an argument appeared to have been premised on a misunderstanding of what the supreme court meant when it used the term &quot;immune from liability.&quot; The phrase did not mean that a nonprofit organization could not be found liable; rather, it meant that the prevailing party in a lawsuit against a nonprofit could not execute on the property or assets of the nonprofit in order to satisfy any judgment. However, as was true in the instant case, the losing party's insurer could be bound to pay up to its policy limits any judgment entered against the nonprofit. The supreme court likewise saw no need to limit Clayborn's holding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his capital murder conviction. The supreme court disagreed. The victim identified defendant as her attacker in the attempted murder and rapes and as the person who was physically abusing the other victim. She further testified that defendant demanded and received money and her ring, using the threat of the broken scissors. Her testimony was sufficient to support a burglary conviction, in that she stated that he pushed his way into the home and proceeded to commit rape and aggravated robbery. And, finally, her in-court identification of defendant, as well as the body hair found in her vagina connecting him to the rape, placed him at the scene where the victim was murdered. While the victim did not specifically see defendant stab the other victim with scissors or beat him, she saw defendant with the scissors standing on the victim's head. She also heard his threats. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant caused the death of the victim in the course of committing several felonies under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An illegal-exaction lawsuit was filed by appellees, a group of taxpayer retirees, against appellant, the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration (department). This second appeal concerned the refund mechanism fashioned by the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) upon remand. Both the taxpayers and the department proposed refund mechanisms. The trial court opted for the taxpayers' refund. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court's first decision held that (1) after-tax contributions to retirement plans were property not subject to income taxes; and (2) income tax levied against after-tax contributions pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-51-307 was an ad valorem tax on property in violation of Ark. Const. Amend. 47, and an illegal exaction under Ark. Const. Art. 16, &sect; 13. On appeal, the department asserted the trial court erred in refusing to (1) apply the voluntary-payment rule to any illegally-exacted taxes paid before the 1999 filing of the lawsuit, and (2) apply I.R.C. &sect; 72, which prorated recovery of after-tax contributions on federal tax returns. On cross-appeal, the taxpayers argued the trial court erred in finding that 1991 Ark. Acts 380 did not violate the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling that 1991 Ark. Acts 380 did not violate the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine; it affirmed the trial court's refusal to apply I.R.C. &sect; 72 to after-tax contributions in employment-related retirement plans; and it reversed the trial court's ruling that the voluntary-payment rule did not apply to taxes paid on after-tax contributions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was affirmed in part. The judgment that the voluntary-payment rule did not apply to taxes paid on after-tax contributions was reversed and remanded with instructions to fashion a remedy consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

The postconviction court dismissed the petition without an evidentiary hearing. The court held that the order complied with the mandates of Ark. R. Crim. P. 37. The trial court did not need to hold a hearing, even though it was a death penalty case, because it could be conclusively shown on the record that the allegations had no merit. The court held that the trial court did not clearly err in finding that counsel's decision to use transcripts of prior testimony as mitigating evidence at resentencing was a matter of trial strategy. Counsel could have considered the potential that the State would more vigorously cross-examine the mitigation witnesses, and counsel did attempt to secure live testimony. Given the evidence of guilt, the prisoner could not show that he was prejudiced by counsel's decision not to object to the prosecutor's closing comments, asking the jury to send a message. Although counsel failed to make a First Amendment objection to admission of a T-shirt, the First Amendment did not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was driving his truck in the early morning hours along a city street. A city police officer observed that the vehicle's stereo was plainly audible at a distance of approximately 75 feet; the officer's car windows were rolled up, and defendant's were down. Because the city's noise ordinance prohibited vehicular stereos being plainly audible at a distance of more than 30 feet, the officer initiated a traffic stop. Upon approaching the vehicle, he smelled a very strong odor of alcoholic beverages. He conducted several field sobriety tests, and determined that defendant was intoxicated. On appeal, defendant argued the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress on the grounds that the noise ordinance was unconstitutional, and the police officer who pulled him over should have known of the ordinance's unconstitutionality. The officer had more than a reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant had just committed a violation of the noise ordinance, and because ordinances are presumed to be constitutional, he reasonably relied on the validity of the noise ordinance to stop defendant. The trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The ADFA was established to issue revenue bonds for the development of business and industry in the state. A company received revenue bonds from the ADFA to establish a plant. The funds were secured by personal guaranties from each individual stockholder. When the company defaulted, the ADFA made demand on the stockholders under the personal guaranty agreements. The stockholders did not make payments and suit was brought to enforce the guaranties. Following a bench trial, judgment was entered for the ADFA The stockholders appealed, arguing the legislature did not authorize the ADFA to execute personal guaranties and they should have been released when other obligors were released. The court found that because each stockholder individually signed a guaranty for a stated amount, and because each was individually liable on the separate guaranties, a release of one guarantor did not release all of them. Also, while personal guaranties were not specifically authorized, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 15-5-413 gave the ADFA authority to make reasonable lending requirements, including personal guaranties. Other issues were not raised below, so the court would not address them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant father appealed the order of the Yell County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which denied his petition to terminate appellee maternal grandmother's visitation rights with his two children. He argued that the trial court erred in dismissing on summary judgment his challenge to the constitutionality of the Arkansas Grandparent Visitation Act (GPVA), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-13-103 (Repl. 2002), and by failing to find a change in circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The father and his wife (the grandmother's daughter) had two children. After the wife died and the father remarried, he denied the grandmother visitation; she sought visitation rights under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-13-103. The father's claim that the GPVA was unconstitutional was rejected, and the grandmother was granted visitation. The father did not appeal, but later filed this action to terminate visitation, alleging as changes in circumstances: (1) changes in constitutional law as to the GPVA; and (2) changes in his children's behavior since visitation was ordered. The appellate court held that the trial court properly granted the grandmother partial summary judgment on grounds that res judicata barred the father's challenge to the constitutionality of the GPVA, as the same parties and issue had been involved in the prior action. As to changes in the children's behavior, the trial court ruled that it was not possible to determine whether their behavioral problems stemmed from the visitation with the grandmother or the blending of the families of the father and his current wife, and, as this finding was supported by the evidence, it would not be disturbed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The new information alleged him to be a habitual-offender. He contended that the new information was an attempt to punish him for exercising his fundamental right to appeal. The Supreme Court of Arkansas disagreed. By the time defendant obtained a new trial, he had been convicted of four counts of rape and one count of aggravated robbery in a separate case. The new convictions were used to amend the felony information. Because it was impossible to proceed on the enhanced-sentencing charge, in defendant's first trial, the State rebutted the presumption of vindictiveness. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash the amended felony information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board passed an ordinance that approved a planned unit development. The company planned to construct a mall on the property, but the landowners sought an injunction. They were successful, but the court reversed. By enacting the ordinance, the board approved the recommended action and amended a prior ordinance, but it rezoned the property and added new conditions to accommodate the rezoning. Thus, the board took legislative action delegated to it under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-56-402 (1998). Because the action was not administrative, the landowners were not required to proceed under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-56-425 and the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction. The court declined to dismiss the matter for lack of standing. The trial court erred in ruling against the company and city on their defense of laches because the landowners could have filed their action sooner. Had they done so, the company would not have bought the subject property. Because the ordinance was new legislation with future ramifications, it was a legislative matter subject to a referendum as provided by Ark. Const. amend. 7. However, whether a referendum election was to be approved was not before the court.</SPAN></P>

The constitutionality of the statutes was not raised until after an appellate court first heard the matter on an earlier appeal. However, the law of the case doctrine was not an alternative reason to affirm the case. The court held that &sect;&sect; 18-27-202, 18-27-203, as applied to the pawn shop, were unconstitutional. The interest acquired by the pawn shop in the goods constituted a sufficient property interest to warrant due process protection. The joint participation to recover the goods by the police department and the owner amounted to state action. The court concluded that the statutes were unconstitutional in mandating the pawn shop to return property to the owner based merely on his request and affidavit before a judicial determination of ownership had taken place and in assessing fees against the pawn shop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The insureds filed a claim, but the insurer denied coverage and contended that they were no longer insured based on a notice of non-renewal that was mailed to the insureds prior to the accident. The insureds brought this action and alleged that the notice statutes,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 23-89-305(a), 23-89-306 (2000) were unconstitutional as applied to the facts. The trial court ruled in favor of the insurer and the court affirmed on appeal. Because the insureds failed to cite to legal authority on their alleged error concerning the finding that the statutes were constitutional as applied, the court did not consider the argument. Section 23-89-306 provided a measure of protection to an insured by requiring notice. Even if use of the United States Postal Service could have been considered state action, the statute's use of regular, non-certified mail was rationally related to a governmental purpose. The requirement of notification did not rise to the level of state action and no due process violation occurred when the statute was enacted. The insureds had no protected property right in any coverage beyond the lapse date. The doctrine of estoppel did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Clark County Circuit Court (Arkansas) convicted defendant of 20 counts of violation of a minor in the first degree, contrary to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-120 (1997), which was since repealed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged his convictions, raising various claims regarding alleged trial and sentencing errors. The State argued on cross-appeal that a no-term sentence imposed and a fine of zero dollars for 15 of the 20 convictions was illegal. The appeals court agreed with the State. First, former Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-120 did not deny defendant equal protection under the law, as the State had an interest in punishing school district employees who facilitated inappropriate relationships with children. Second, evidence that defendant violated a no contact order was properly admitted, because when said order was violated, defendant continued to harm the victim, adding to the injurious consequences of his crime. Third, while defendant was prosecuted for violation of a minor in the first degree and not rape, the commission of both offenses prohibited sexual intercourse or deviate sexual activity. Thus, consecutive sentences were proper. As to the State's cross-appeal, the sentence of no term of imprisonment and no fine was improper, as the sentencing range was five to twenty years' imprisonment, or a fine not to exceed $ 15,000, or both. Thus, resentencing was ordered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgments of conviction on all counts were affirmed. But, on the cross-appeal, the judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for resentencing on counts six through twenty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

In another county, he filed a motion to dismiss the State's charge, alleging that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-71-228 (Repl. 1997) violated both his federal and state right to free speech. Testimony at trial established that defendant was harassing hunters and scaring game away by blowing a whistle and firing shots from a .22 calibre pistol. The trial court upheld &sect; 5-71-228 and found defendant guilty. On appeal, defendant again raised claims as to the constitutionality of the statute and the sufficiency of the evidence. The appellate court was precluded from reviewing his sufficiency claim under Ark. R. Crim. P. 33.1, because he failed to move at trial to dismiss the State's case based on the insufficiency of evidence. The constitutional issues raised on appeal were not preserved for review; defendant never mentioned vagueness or overbreadth, much less developed an argument on either, to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

He contended that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on a lesser-included offense and by not allowing him to present a mistake-of-age defense. In affirming, the court determined that carnal abuse in the third degree was not a lesser-included offense of &sect; 5-14-103(a)(4). The carnal abuse statute,&nbsp;Ark.

The Pulaski County Circuit Court, Twelfth Division (Arkansas), entered a letter order, determining that the appellees, the decedent's children, were pretermitted heirs of the estate and thus entitled to inherit the real property located in Arkansas. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent lived as married with the alleged common law wife in Alberta, Canada, for less than three years before he died. With a holographic will the common law wife initiated probate proceedings in Canada and ancillary proceedings in Arkansas, where the decedent had real and personal property. The children, not mentioned in the will, contested the same. The trial court determined that the children were pretermitted children entitled to the decedent's Arkansas real property under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-39-107(b) (1987). Applying Arkansas law as to the will pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-25-105 (1987), the court on appeal held that the trial court properly determined that there was no common law marriage. Alberta statutory law did not recognize common law marriages at the time of decedent's death, and the relationship did not meet the three-year cohabitation requirement under Alberta case law. The fact that national Canadian law recognized the common law marriage was irrelevant. The will failed to mention either of the decedent's children; hence, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-39-407(b) (1987) applied, and the children were entitled to the decedent's real property in Arkansas.</SPAN></P>

She further testified that, about one week after the therapy sessions ended, she and the physical therapist met and engaged in sexual intercourse. The physical therapist argued there was a lack of credibility of the State's witnesses, due to threats and coercion towards the patient, whether by her husband, or others, and that the State failed to show a sexual relationship during the &quot;term of the treatment.&quot; The physical therapist also argued the Board failed to exclude witnesses from the hearing room, under Ark.

Const. amend. 47 in connection with taxing benefits paid under a retirement plan pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-51-307 (Supp. 2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers were those who made after-tax contributions to retirement plans. The trial court found that the DFA violated Ark. Const. amend. 47 when it attempted to tax benefits paid under a retirement plan, where the benefit taxed after-tax contributions being returned to the taxpayer. The DFA argued that, under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-51-307 (Supp. 2001), the legislature declared that the return of retirement plan after-tax contributions was income. The court affirmed the partial summary judgment grant in the taxpayer's favor and held that, when after-tax contributions to a retirement plan were returned to a retiree, that return was property, not income. The attempt to levy a value-based tax on the after-tax contributions constituted an illegal exaction, because the DFA was attempting to levy a tax in violation of Ark. Const. amend. 47. Just because a state chose to characterize a tax as an income tax did not make it an income tax. The tax the DFA sought to collect was really an ad valorem tax on property, which was prohibited under the constitution. Thus, the DFA's attempted application of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-51-307 (Supp. 2001) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Pulaski County Circuit Court, Arkansas, set aside a default judgment against appellees, car dealership and its successor, in appellant buyer's suit alleging fraud and a breach of contract after the buyer purchased a used car from the dealership that was found to be defective. The buyer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The buyer argued that the circuit court erred in dismissing her amended complaint with prejudice. The appellate court noted that the buyer's summonses were deficient under Ark. R. Civ. P. 4(b). Because the service requirements were strictly construed and compliance with them had to be exact, the complaint was properly dismissed for failure of service of valid process under Ark. R. Civ. P. 12(b). The one-year savings statute merely tolled the general statute of limitations. Ark. R. Civ. P. 41(b) applied to the second dismissal, which was an adjudication on the merits. The buyer's breach of contract claim against the dealership's successor should have been dismissed without prejudice. Her fraud claim was time barred because when she amended the complaint to add the successor, the three-year statute of limitations had expired. The buyer could not use Ark. R. Civ. P. 6(b) to enlarge the time to obtain service when she had not complied with Ark. R. Civ. P. 4(i). A summons that incorrectly identified the defendants and misstated the deadline for responding to the complaint did not comply with the service requirements. The constitutionality of Ark. R. Civ. P. 12(a) was upheld.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-75-701 to 713 (Repl. 1996), and the cost of doing business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The legal dispute began in 1995 when the cigarette and other product wholesaler contacted the Department of Finance &amp; Administration, requesting it to repeal Miscellaneous Tax Regulation 1988-2 that it promulgated pursuant to the Act. The director notified the wholesaler that it could commence selling cigarettes at the new minimum price, but the competitors filed an action requesting that the board be prohibited from implementing the new Miscellaneous Tax Regulation 1995-5. The board then rescinded its earlier approval of the wholesaler's new cost of doing business amount of .5 percent. The wholesaler then filed the current action, and the court previously reversed and remanded to determine how and under what authority the board acted when it determined and increased the basic cost of cigarettes to be at four percent. The court reversed in part, stating that the board failed to show that its regulation and actions fell within the Act's provision; thus, the four percent cost of doing business was arbitrary, ultra vires, and unenforceable. The two percent presumptive cost of doing business would then govern, thereby triggering the other valid remaining provisions of the regulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed in part, stating that the board failed to show its regulation and actions fell within the Acts provision and remanded; the remainder was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to relieve his attorney of record.

The appellate court found that while defendant's motion set forth differences between himself and his counsel regarding the fee arrangement, it did not expressly state that his attorney's representation was compromised. The circuit court considered the length of time this matter had been pending and the proximity of the trial date. It was not error for the circuit court to deny defendant's motion in limine to prohibit any reference to the unborn fetus by name where the fetus was at term at the time of death, had been named, and the name was included in the criminal information. The appellate court would not consider defendant's constitutional argument as to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-102 (Supp. 1999) as it was made for the first time on appeal. Defendant failed to present a record on appeal that informed the appellate court of arguments made below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 6-61-301 (Repl. 1996) empowered the Department to establish the criteria required for certification and to promulgate rules and regulations regarding degree programs. The church and its college offered two specific degree programs, and generally, degree programs granted by colleges and universities needed to be certified by the State. An exception came under Rule 8 of the Department's &quot;Rules and Regulations for Institutional and Program Certification in Arkansas&quot; (the Rules). Rule 8 provided an exception for certification in certain circumstances where the predominant purposes of the courses and programs were religious. That exception had to be pursued through the Arkansas Higher Education Coordinating Board. The appellate court concluded it was the church's responsibility to pursue the matter to completion through the Arkansas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which was charged with the responsibility of determining the propriety of exemptions. Here, the church could have brought such a declaratory action to determine whether or not Rule 8 should have applied. Thus, the church had an adequate alternative remedy and was not entitled to a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The committee circulated a petition to place an ordinance &quot;to create a fire department&quot; on the city's general election ballot.

The committee was allowed to intervene in the matter, but the circuit court informed the committee that a hearing on the merits could only be set on a date after the election, but that the committee could appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the commission was enjoined from placing the ballot title on the ballot. While the election was over, the Arkansas Supreme Court chose to address the issue of whether the committee had standing to intervene. The committee argued it had standing as a nonprofit association, pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-28-507 (Repl. 2001), and that it should have been joined as a necessary party pursuant to Ark. R. Civ. P. 19(a). The appellate court held the committee, which was not joined by a local voter and, further, did not purport to represent local voters, lacked standing to intervene in a case concerning rights that, pursuant to Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee mortgagor obtained a loan from appellant bank to purchase land for a ranch. Later, the mortgagor informed the bank of his intent to file for bankruptcy. The enraged bank filed criminal complaints, alleging the mortgagor disposed of secured assets. The mortgagor was charged with felonies. A jury in the Carroll County Circuit Court, Western Division, Arkansas, held the bank liable for malicious prosecution. The bank appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The bank approved a $ 460,000 loan for the mortgagor who had other outstanding loans with the bank. The mortgagor sought to turn undeveloped land into a cattle ranch by cutting the timber. A loan worksheet provided that half the loan could be repaid by timber sales. However, the mortgage provided that the mortgagor &quot;could not cut timber from the encumbered land.&quot; When the mortgagor's fortunes collapsed, he considered bankruptcy. The bank then prosecuted through the county attorney, alleging the businessman wrongfully cut timber and illegally disposed of assets. The mortgagor was never convicted of the alleged offenses, but his reputation was badly damaged by the publicity. His construction business was basically destroyed as a result. The appellate court held the bank was not protected by the safe harbor provision of the Annunizo-Wylie Money Laundering Act, 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5318(g)(3), an immunity provision. The appellate court held the Act did not give banks blanket immunity for malicious actions. Further, the trial court did not err in denying the bank its directed verdict motions, as there was substantial evidence to support the elements of malicious prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appellate court held the jury's award of $ 100,000 compensatory damages for the businessman, in light of almost $ 40,000 of actual damages, as well as mental anguish stemming from fear of imprisonment, embarrassment before the community, and destruction of his business reputation, was supported by substantial evidence. The award of $ 300,000 in punitive damages was proper under the circumstances. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

At trial, defendant claimed that he shot the victim in self-defense during a fight.

The prosecutor relied on the Arkansas Model Jury Instructions, Criminal, as the basis for his definition and explanation of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, his statements to the jury about conflicting testimony were not technically incorrect, but his statements represented a subtle attempt to shift the burden of proof by equating defendant's burden of proof with the State's burden. The court reversed defendant's death sentence because verdict Form 2 was not signed or filed, and, therefore, the court was unable to say that the jury considered any possible mitigating circumstances, much less that it concluded that beyond a reasonable doubt that the only aggravating circumstance outweighed any mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee architect filed a complaint with the Arkansas State Board of Architects, alleging that appellant engineer, as a non-architect, designed and stamped different aspects of a project. The board found that the engineer practiced architecture without a license, and it imposed a fine. The engineer filed an appeal to the trial court and then appealed to the Arkansas Court of Appeals. The board petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The engineer prepared and filed plans for a metal building. The engineer asserted that it was his understanding that his work on the facility was well within the realm of engineering activity. On appeal, the engineer argued that the statutes defining the practice of architecture and the practice of engineering were void for vagueness. The appellate court determined, however, that a person of ordinary intelligence could glean that architects plan and design buildings primarily intended for people to live and work in, and engineers plan and design buildings primarily intended for accommodation of equipment, vehicles, goods, and/or processes. The statutes were not void for vagueness. The engineer also argued that the board failed to make necessary findings of fact. The appellate court disagreed. The board's findings contained relevant sufficient facts so that the appellate court could determine whether the board resolved those issues in conformity with the law. The engineer also argued that the penalty imposed by the board was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, the imposition of the civil penalty was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-102(13)(B)(i)(b) (Supp. 1999). He subsequently pled guilty to murder in the first degree and battery. He claimed that he entered into the plea agreement with the condition that he would be permitted to pursue his constitutional challenge under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37. The trial court denied his postconviction petition, and the court affirmed. When a guilty plea was challenged under R. 37, the sole issue was whether the plea was intelligently and voluntarily entered with the advice of competent counsel. Rule 37 did not provide an avenue to raise matters that could have been raised on direct appeal, including constitutional claims, and a constitutional claim was not in itself sufficient to trigger application of R. 37. The inmate's claims were not cognizable under the rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers paid an assessment to the research board as first-time rice buyers under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 2-20-511 (1996). A company filed an action claiming that the assessment was an illegal exaction, in violation of Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 13. Subsequently, it was determined that &sect; 2-20-511 constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative authority under Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 23. It was not decided whether or not the assessment constituted an illegal exaction. The taxpayers then filed an illegal exaction action, which sought a refund of all assessments paid. After the trial court determined that the taxpayers were not entitled to a refund because the assessments were voluntarily paid, they sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the issues adjudicated in the prior action were not limited to the company that filed the action. The action filed by the company constituted a class action, which was prosecuted on behalf of all affected taxpayers. Moreover, the case was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata, as the taxpayers were not given proper notice of the suit. Finally, the court found that the action was not barred by laches for the same reason.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The cooperative claimed that it incurred significant expenses in moving power lines and poles after the county widens roads that encroached on the cooperative's easements and rights-of-way. The county claimed that it had a right-of-way in the land used to widen the roads based on an earlier court order. The trial court ruled in the county's favor. The court reversed and found that summary judgment was improperly granted. The earlier order did not purport to convey a property interest to the county. Whether the county, the cooperative, or both possessed a right-of-way in the land adjoining the roadway had not been determined below. The trial court was required to determine what rights, if any, both the county and the cooperative possessed in the land in question. If the cooperative had a property interest in the land where the poles and power lines were standing before the roads were widened, then forcing the movement of the poles and lines might have constituted a taking that required compensation, and the common law rule that a utility was to bear the costs of relocation did not apply where the county widened the road, but only when relocation was required by a public necessity.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the notice of the sale given by the Commissioner was valid. The court agreed. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-37-301 (1997) required notice by certified mail, and the Commissioner strictly complied with the statute's requirements. The statute did not require that the Commissioner take every step possible to see that the letter arrived. The court agreed with the trial court that the constitutional issues were not properly raised. While the taxpayer wife had filed a motion for a new trial, the constitutional issues raised therein should have been raised earlier. The trial court did not err in dismissing the taxpayer husband's constitutional claim pursuant to Ark. R. Civ. P. 13(a). The taxpayer husband's claims arose out of the same transaction that was the subject of the original matter, and as such the claim was a compulsory counterclaim that should have been brought during the trial of the matter instead of later. Because the issues raised by the taxpayer husband were not timely presented, the dismissal of his claim was also affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State argued that the court of appeals failed to apply the totality-of-the-circumstances test in concluding that the evidence should be suppressed. For clarification of the standard of review, the appellate court concluded that the standard was that the appellate court conduct a de novo review based on the totality of the circumstances, reviewing findings of historical facts for clear error and determining whether those facts gave rise to reasonable suspicion or probable cause, giving due weight to inferences drawn by the trial court. The appellate court concluded that the police had a reasonable suspicion to make the stop. Defendant and another man were in a high crime area known for drug activity. Defendant exhibited nervous, evasive behavior, which was a pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion. The testimony revealed that the officer was concerned about the possibility of drugs and weapons violations. He had seen defendant engage in a hand-to-hand transaction with another man, and he did not know what was in defendant's pocket. As such, the pat-down search was justified under the totality of the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner mother was in the military, based out-of-state. The children's grandparents had been granted guardianship over the children. The Circuit Court of the 18th Judicial District (East), State of Arkansas, ordered the mother to appear and show cause why she should not be held in contempt. The mother petitioned the instant court for a writ of prohibition, and the circuit court stayed the proceeding pending the instant court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mother joined the Army and was stationed in Hawaii. Ultimately, the grandparents were granted guardianship over the children. The grandparents then filed a petition for contempt, alleging that the mother had removed the children. The issue was whether service on a court-appointed attorney for the absent military mother was sufficient service of process in a case of continuing jurisdiction. The mother's argument was that the trial court was without jurisdiction to enter the guardianship order due to a lack of personal jurisdiction, because neither she nor her children lived in Arkansas, and she was not properly served with notice. The State countered that under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-1-112(e) (Supp. 2001), notice could be served upon the party's attorney of record. It was undisputed that service was made on the mother's attorney of record. Thus, the service of notice was in compliance with &sect; 28-1-112(e). There may have been a conflict between the provisions of Ark. R. Civ. P. 5, and Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-1-112(e) (Supp. 2001). Ark. R. Civ. P. 5 required service on the party. However, the mother did not brief this issue, and the appellate court held the trial court had jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The patient did not respond to the affidavit. After summary judgment was granted, the patient sought review. In affirming, the court determined that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-206(b), which set forth the burden of proof in an informed consent case, was constitutional. Specifically, &sect; 16-114-206(b) required a medical expert in every case involving informed consent. The court also held that there was a rational basis for drawing a distinction between informed consent cases and other medical malpractice cases. There was a rational relationship between the burden of proof required and the achievement of a legitimate governmental objective. Finally, the court declined to apply the &quot;common knowledge&quot; exception to informed consent cases.</SPAN></P>

P. 68 on the grounds that the claimant's recovery was less than the offer. The trial court granted the driver's motion but denied on the claimant's on the grounds that the award to the driver precluded an award to the claimant. The appellate court held that the two rules were not mutually exclusive, and both parties could recover costs on the facts in this case. The case was remanded to the trial court to determine the amount of the claimant's costs. The award would, however be limited to costs accrued prior to the offer because those costs, plus the amount of the award, did exceed the offer.

Defendant was later convicted of breaking or entering and felony theft of property in Arkansas and given suspended sentences. The State subsequently sought to revoke defendant's suspended sentences alleging defendant failed to register as a sex offender. The Sebastian County Circuit Court (Arkansas) revoked defendant's suspended sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that the revocation of his suspended sentence on the basis of the amended version of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-12-905 was an unconstitutional ex post facto application of the law. Defendant also argued that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the revocation of his suspended sentence. The appellate court rejected defendant's arguments. Defendant's ex post facto argument failed because his sentence was imposed in October of 1997, and, the effective date of the amendment was August 1, 1997. Thus, defendant had 30 days after August 1, 1997, in which to register, and he failed to do so. The court also found that because the evidence showed that defendant was convicted of a sex offense and registered as a sex offender in Wisconsin, had lived in Arkansas since 1992, and failed to register as a sex offender in Arkansas in accordance with the requirements in &sect; 12-12-905, the State met its burden of proving that defendant violated a condition of his suspended sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant inmate filed a civil rights action against appellees, the director and the assistant director of the Arkansas Department of Correction (ADC), in their official and individual capacities. The alleged causes of action arose out of an administrative directive concerning prisoner cleanliness and grooming. The Lee County Circuit Court, Arkansas, dismissed the action with prejudice for failure to state a claim. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1978, inmates of the ADC filed a class action suit against ADC officials, raising First Amendment challenges to ADC grooming and food policies. The parties entered a mediated settlement agreement. As a result of the agreement, the ADC issued a less restrictive grooming policy. In 1998, the ADC issued a new grooming policy, which set standardized hair length and prohibited beards. Federal courts refused to find the ADC in contempt and, ultimately, terminated the settlement agreement. The inmate entered the ADC in 1991. He claimed his religion required that his beard and hair not be clipped beyond that allowed by the Bible. The inmate alleged he was disciplined following the enactment of the 1998 policy. The supreme court held that because the inmate's request for relief, if granted, would control the action of the ADC, a state agency, and subject it to liability, his claims against the director and the assistant director in their official capacities were constitutionally barred. The director and the assistant director were personally immune from suit because they did not violate clearly established principles of law of which a reasonable person would have knowledge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The order dismissing the inmate's complaint was modified to be without prejudice. As modified, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee school district and others (the district) sued appellant State officials (the State) in the Chancery Court of Pulaski County, Arkansas, challenging the constitutionality of the school-funding system (the system). The trial court held that the system violated the Arkansas Constitution. The court awarded over $ 9,000,000 in attorney fees to the district, but denied costs. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court ruled that the system violated the education and equality articles of the Arkansas Constitution. The ruling also addressed other specific aspects of the system. The appellate court agreed that the State had not fulfilled its duty to provide an adequate school funding system in violation of Ark. Const. art. 14, &sect; 1. The system also violated Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect;&sect; 2, 3, and 18, the equality articles, because the system did not ensure equality of funding among school districts on a per student basis, and there was no rational basis for such discrepancies. The constitution did not, however, require the creation of pre-school programs. The appellate court further held that the trial court properly excluded desegregation funds and weighted average daily membership in determining funding equality. The trial court had, however, erred in applying Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-80-204(18)(C) (Supp. 2001), regarding excess millage, as the statute violated Ark. Const. amend. 74. A total of approximately $ 3,000,000 in attorney fees and costs were approved. The court stayed its mandate to allow the State time to fashion a system that met constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court's order regarding the unconstitutionality of the public school-funding system was affirmed, but some portions of the ruling were reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondents, the Democratic Party of Arkansas and its counsel, prayed for an immediate hearing to extended the voting hours. The circuit court judge granted the motion and extended the voting hours. Counsel for the Republican Party of Arkansas argued that the circuit court judge had no authority to extend voting hours and that to do so was an abuse of discretion. Counsel for the Democratic Party of Arkansas argued that registered voters had a constitutional right to vote and they were being deprived of that right. Members of six of the justices for the state supreme court voted to void the circuit court judge's emergency order. The state supreme court held that the election law, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 7-5-304 (2000), was clear that the polls opened at 7:30 a.m. on the day of the election and closed at 7:30 p.m. The legislative branch had spoken on that issue, and there was no provision in the Arkansas Election Code authorizing an extension of voting times by the judiciary. Thus, the circuit court judge clearly abused his discretion and exceeded his authority in extending the voting hours to 9:00 p.m. in contravention of state law.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court initially noted the inmate clearly failed to state a claim on which the trial court could have granted him the relief sought; thus, pursuant to Ark. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) he was not entitled to relief or to proceed in forma pauperis, and had to remit the filing fee if he desired to pursue his appeal. The appellate court held Ark.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee lawyer sued appellant mother in the Jefferson County Circuit Court (Arkansas), seeking recovery under a contingency fee contract. The trial court concluded that there was no justifiable cause for the mother's termination of the contract and that the lawyer had a valid attorney's lien against a proposed settlement with the tortfeasor for injuries to the mother's two minor sons. The mother's appeal was certified to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supreme court held that the mother failed to preserve the issue of the constitutionality of Arkansas' attorney's lien statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-22-301 et seq., for its review, because she failed to raise her claim until her motion for new trial. Therefore, the supreme court was concerned only with the validity of the contract and the attorney's lien against the proposed settlement to which it gave rise. The mother argued that 13 of the trial court's findings of fact were clearly against the preponderance of the evidence. The supreme court found there was ample evidence from which the trial court could conclude that the mother entered into a valid contract with the lawyer and did not have cause to terminate him. The mother asserted that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the expert testimony of her witness, a nurse. The nurse conceded that she could not authenticate her medical records. The mother failed to proffer the substance of the nurse's testimony or her opinions as to what possible effects the medication might have had on the mother's state of mind to enter into the contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant juvenile was charged with the rape of a victim under 14, and was adjudicated a delinquent in the Juvenile Division of the Circuit Court of Lonoke County (Arkansas). The juvenile had moved to present testimony bearing on the child's prior sexual conduct. The trial court denied the motion. The juvenile appealed, asserting that the rape shield statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-42-101 (Repl. 1999), was inapplicable to a juvenile proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The juvenile asserted that even if Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-42-101 (Repl. 1999) was constitutional, the statute should not be applicable to juvenile proceedings. The rape shield statute itself set out in clear words that it was to be applied &quot;in any criminal prosecution&quot; involving rape or other sexual offenses. The appellate court held that because a juvenile-delinquency proceeding was not a criminal prosecution, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-42-101 was inapplicable to the juvenile's proceeding. But the appellate court had to decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the juvenile's proffered testimony on the basis of that testimony's irrelevance under Ark. R. Evid. 401. The appellate court noted that a person who had sexual intercourse or deviate sexual activity with one less than 14 years of age was guilty of the crime, regardless of how old he or she thought the victim was, and regardless of whether there was consent. Because the victim was under the age of 14, the victim's sexual past was completely irrelevant to the question of whether or not the juvenile engaged in sexual activity with the victim. Therefore, the trial court properly excluded the proffered testimony.</SPAN></P>

VII, references to matters outside the ballot title were insufficient to inform the voters concerning the choice they were to make, the title failed to inform voters about the fiscal consequences of the proposed amendment, and the definitions of &quot;food&quot; and &quot;medicine&quot; were misleading.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The citizen's petition dealt with a proposed amendment to the Arkansas Constitution to abolish taxes on food and medicine. Respondent Secretary of State argued that the court did not have jurisdiction until after the secretary had certified an initiative petition pursuant to Ark. Const. amend. VII. The reviewing court found that 1999 Ark. Acts 877, codified at Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 7-9-503(a)(1) (Repl. 2000), provided a procedure whereby a taxpayer could seek an early review of a ballot title's legal sufficiency prior to the gathering of signatures; that is, it was discretionary. Sufficiency of a ballot title was a matter of law to be decided by the court. The definitions of &quot;food&quot; and &quot;medicine&quot; in the ballot title incorporated and established benchmark. It was an impartial description that adequately identified the proposed amendment. A voter would be capable of understanding that any item eligible to be purchased or otherwise available under any state or federal nutrition or health care assistance program would no longer be taxed. The ballot title presented the voter with a fair understanding of the issues presented and the scope and significance of the proposed changes.</SPAN></P>

P. 26(b)(1) as it was not raised at the trial level. The appellate court could not determine whether the surgeon and clinic were able to hide their opinions and surprise the patient at trial when the record contained no information to support the argument. The patient did not show how Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-207(3) of the Arkansas Medical Malpractice Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-207 to -209 (1987), had adversely impacted upon her.

Appellant city challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In its petition, the county argued 1963 Ark. Acts 219 was unconstitutional because it apportioned 90 percent of the road tax funds collected from within the corporate limits of the cities to the cities. The trial court agreed and declared the act unconstitutional. The city appealed, arguing the trial court erred in granting summary judgment without requiring the county to meet its burden of proof that the act was not rationally related to achieving a legitimate objective of state government. The appellate court initially noted merely because a statute ultimately affected less than all of the state's territory did not necessarily render it unconstitutional local or special legislation. The appellate court held an act of the general assembly that applied to only a portion of the state was constitutional if the reason for limiting the act to one area was rationally related to the purposes of that act. The appellate court concluded the county did not meet its burden of proving that the act was not rationally related to achieving a legitimate governmental objective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The general assembly convened an extraordinary session at the governor's call to address the need for a one-half percent sales and use tax increase. There were two issues on appeal: (1) whether the emergency clause of Act 1 was valid under Ark. Const. amend. 7; and (2) whether a bill introduced in a three-day extraordinary session of the general assembly was unconstitutional under Ark. Const. art. 5 &sect; 34. The circuit court found the emergency clause presented numerous facts. Although fair-minded reasonable persons might differ as to their sufficiency and truth, they were sufficient to meet the highly deferential standard under which the judiciary reviewed legislative emergency clauses. The circuit court ruled that Act 1 was not in violation of Ark. Const. art. 5 &sect; 34, as that constitutional provision prohibiting bills from being filed during the last three days of a legislative session did not apply to bills filed during an extraordinary session called by the governor. The question was whether the general assembly stated facts constituting an emergency upon which reasonable minds might disagree.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the severance order and held that the insurer was bound by the judgment. On remand, the trial court granted the victim attorney fees and post-judgment interest from the date of the original judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse in violation of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-108(a)(4) (Repl. 1997) (repealed), in the Pope County Circuit Court (Arkansas). At trial, defendant's motion in limine to allow testimony to prove he reasonably believed the victim was over the age of 14, and his motion for a directed verdict that the State failed to prove the element of mental culpability for the offense was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's appeal raised the issue of whether the State had the burden of proving a culpable mental state in connection with a charge of first-degree sexual abuse involving a victim under the age of 14. Defendant was convicted under former Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-108(a)(4) (Repl. 1997) (repealed) for which the corresponding present offense would be Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-125(a)(3) (Supp. 2001). The appellate court held that the statutory rape provision at the time, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-103(a)(4) (Repl. 1997) (superseded), and Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-108(a)(4) (Repl. 1997) (repealed), were subject to a specific statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-102(b), that eliminated knowledge, or even a reasonable belief, of the victim's age as a defense. Thus, the trial court did not err in ruling that the State was not required to prove defendant's knowledge of the victim's age in a prosecution for first-degree sexual abuse under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-108(a)(4) (Repl. 1997) (repealed). Defendant's argument that the victim's statements that occurred on the day of the offense should have been admitted was rejected as encompassed by the rape-shield statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-42-101(b) (Repl. 1999).</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the mother's petition to cease and restrict visitation and granted the petition for grandparent visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The father and mother divorced, and the father was awarded visitation of their young daughter. He continued to have visitation with the girl for three more years. At that time, the father was found guilty of sexual abuse of his daughter. Thereafter, the trial court restricted the father's visitation to those times when his parents were physically present. The grandparents were awarded grandparent visitation rights. On appeal, the mother argued the Grandparental Visitation Rights Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-13-103 (Repl. 2002), was facially unconstitutional under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, and that the Act was unconstitutional as applied to her; alternatively, she asserted that the trial court failed to comply with the Act in awarding the grandparents visitation. The appeals court initially found that facial invalidation of the Act was inappropriate. It also found the Act did not unconstitutionally discriminate between married and divorced parents. However, because the trial court failed to apply any presumption in favor of the custodial parent's decision regarding visitation, the appeals court held that the Act was unconstitutionally applied in this case.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 5-2-614 (Repl. 1997), because the evidence revealed that defendant left the crime scene, returned with a weapon, and killed the four victims, therefore, defendant could not rationally argue that he negligently formed the belief that the use of deadly force was necessary to protect himself; (3) trial counsel's failure to move to sever the four murder counts did not support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because the motion would not have been successful; and (4) the trial court's use of victim-impact testimony under Ark.

Visitation was granted by the Sebastian County Chancery Court, Arkansas. The mother, the maternal grandmother, and the mother's sister appealed. The State of Arkansas intervened to defend the constitutionality of the Arkansas Grandparental Visitation Act (GPVA), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-13-103 (Repl. 2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Prior to the death of the child's father, the paternal grandparents saw the child frequently. After the death of the child's father, the mother was resistant to allowing the paternal grandparent's visitation. The chancery court found that the mother was a fit parent, ordered that the paternal grandparents had visitation rights, and refused to allow the mother to move to another state for a job. The mother fled the jurisdiction for approximately a year, then returned and appealed the chancery court's order based on the constitutionality of the GPVA. The Arkansas Supreme Court found that: (1) the paternal grandparents' motion to dismiss the appeal due to law of the case had no merit because there was no previous judgment on an appeal; (2) res judicata did not apply to bar the appeal of a child visitation order; and (3) the GPVA was unconstitutional as applied because so long as the mother was fit to care for the child, the Fourteenth Amendment right attached, and the State could not interfere without a compelling interest to do so; there had to be some other special factor such as harm to the child or custodial unfitness that justified State interference.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court: (1) held the individual's claim for illegal exactions under Ark. Const. art.

The appellate court initially noted a law was unconstitutionally vague under due process standards if it did not give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what was prohibited. The appellate court held defendant's conduct clearly fell within that proscribed by &sect; 5-14-120 because the evidence at trial indicated he was a guardian of the victim, thus the statute was not void for vagueness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was previously convicted for DWI. At that time, Ark.

Subsequently, the habitual offender statute was amended to provide for a five-year look back period. Thereafter, defendant was convicted for DWI, second offense, and charged as a habitual offender. On appeal, defendant argued the five-year look-back period was an unconstitutional ex post facto statute. He further asserted the extended look back period violated the Double Jeopardy Clause and did not permit a revival of his first DWI conviction. The appellate court initially noted the amendment to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-65-111 (Supp. 1999) was in effect on the date of defendant's second offense; thus, his sentence was not violative of ex post facto laws. The appellate court held defendant's second argument was not preserved for appellate review because he did not first raise the argument in the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant escaped prison by hiding in a hog-slop tank that was hauled from the prison. He jumped from the tank and walked to the victim's home where he robbed and killed the victim. Defendant fled from the police in another state in a high-speed auto chase that resulted in defendant's vehicle colliding with another vehicle, killing the driver of that vehicle. On appeal, the supreme court found (1) the trial court improperly submitted the underlying felony of first-degree escape to the jury as defendant had already completed his escape when he killed the first victim; (2) the capital felony murder conviction was proper due to the jury's separate finding of guilt on the underlying felony of aggravated robbery; (3) defendant was properly required to wear prison garb and restraints in the presence of guards during the trial; (4) a juror was acceptable because once her nephew's murder was raised, her responses to questions cured any issue of bias; (5) evidence of the auto chase was admissible; (6) aggravators on multiple deaths and murder to avoid arrest were properly submitted; and (7) the trial court properly substituted an alternate juror without discussing it with the parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Chancery Court of Craighead County, Arkansas, entered a supplemental decree of divorce in favor of appellee husband, ordering that the marital residence be sold and the proceeds distributed after the sale. Appellant wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The wife argued that the trial court erred in denying her request for discovery, in finding the premarital agreement to be valid, and in failing to properly distribute the marital property. Both parties expressly waived their rights to a detailed disclosure of the other's financial obligations. The agreement was accompanied by a notarized statement that the wife had read and fully understood the agreement, as well as a notarized statement by her attorney that he had explained the contract to her and advised her of her legal rights and the legal effect of the agreement. A premarital agreement could only be amended or revoked by written agreement signed by both parties, under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-405. The decision to postpone discovery until after the court could determine the validity of the prenuptial agreement was intended to save the time and expense of preparing answers to interrogatories and responses to requests for production of documents. Both parties owned their property as a tenancy by the entirety and had an equal right of ownership and possession. The vehicle, boat, lot, and country club membership were owned by the corporation and was not marital property.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the supreme court found defendant failed to preserve the sufficiency issue for review because he did not renew his motion at the close of all the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's horse tested positive for equine infectious anemia on the Coggins test for that illness. The issue on appeal was whether Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 2-40-813 was unconstitutionally vague and therefore void, in violation of the due process guarantees of the United States and Arkansas Constitutions, because of the failure to define &quot;research facility&quot; and the failure of the State to provide a mechanism for &quot;permitting&quot; a horse thereto. Defendant asserted that the statute was void for vagueness, both facially and as applied, because it did not give sufficient guidance to persons on how to comply with its terms. The State asserted and the appellate court agreed that defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. Defendant's actions fell squarely within the actions described by the statute in that after her horse tested positive on the Coggins test, it appeared she that failed to quarantine him. Moreover, defendant never attempted to &quot;permit&quot; her horse to a &quot;research facility,&quot; which is that part of the statute she contended was vague. As such, defendant had no standing to raise the constitutional argument.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 17-25-308 (Repl. 1995), allowing revocation of a contractors license. The board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board argued that the circuit court erred in finding that it had acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner based on the court's reading that &quot;misconduct&quot; had to affect the &quot;physical&quot; &quot;public health and safety&quot; pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-25-305(a).  Ark. Code Ann.&nbsp;&sect; 17-25-308, the statutory provision detailing the requirements for revocation of a contractor's license, laid out the only reasons the board could revoke a contractor's license. The statute did not state that they would be used to determine if misconduct had occurred when considering revocation.  Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 17-25-305 and 17-25-308 contained different provisions and requirements for different circumstances and could not be applied interchangeably. The company failed to honor three bids, one of which was an actual contract. The letters failed to attempt to work out an alternative option for resolution. The company offered no defense as to why it could not follow through on the bids. The board's decision was supported by a rational basis in that the board was bound to regulate the profession, not only the public at large, but the general contractors who relied on the subcontractors for bids.</SPAN></P>

A criminal background check of the driver showed drug charges, which the driver did not reveal, after being questioned. The officer asked permission to search the van, which the driver angrily denied. The officer's drug dog investigated the van, and alerted for the presence of drugs. The van was searched, revealing drugs and paraphernalia. The officer's initial information allowed him to make a valid traffic stop, even though the information was erroneous. By the time that was discovered, the totality of the circumstances, including the driver's criminal history, failure to disclose his drug arrest and charge, refusal to reveal the van's ownership, combative demeanor, and the drugs and paraphernalia gave the officer reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, authorizing further detention of the occupants, and a search of the van.</SPAN></P>
