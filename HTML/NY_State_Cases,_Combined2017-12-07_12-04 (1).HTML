</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property was the subject of fraudulent acquisitions. Thereafter, pursuant to N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 1122, the county filed a verified list of delinquent taxes, which included the subject property. The original owner commenced an action against the fraudulent title holder and others, and a notice of pendency was filed. The county filed a petition and notice of foreclosure of tax liens, which was published in local newspapers and personally served upon the successor in interest of the fraudulent title holder, who was the apparent record owner. The foreclosure was granted and the county conveyed the property. The trial court held that the fraudulent deed was in fact void, and the property title was restored to the original owner, who then commenced the instant action to set aside the foreclosure sale. The trial court granted summary judgment to the county. On appeal, the court noted that the county had complied with N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 1125(1)(a), as no notice of pendency or other indication of the original owner's interest was filed. It was noted that the owner did not attempt to determine the status of taxes on the property. There was no due process violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found &sect; 6512(1) was not unconstitutionally vague. The trial court providently exercised its discretion in denying that branch of defendant's omnibus motion which was for release of the grand jury minutes as she failed to demonstrate a compelling and particularized need for their production. By pleading guilty, defendant waived her claim that the evidence submitted to the grand jury was insufficient to support the indictment. In any event, the evidence before the grand jury was legally sufficient to establish the elements of unauthorized practice of massage therapy. The trial court also properly denied those branches of defendant's omnibus motion which were to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the grand jury was defective and impaired. The People's submission of the minutes and attendance sheet for August 14, 2003, confirmed that an adequate number of jurors were present and concurred in the indictment. Moreover, the prosecutor's conduct did not impair the grand jury's integrity. The indictment, as supplemented by the bill of particulars, provided defendant with sufficiently specific information as to the manner, time, and place of the crimes charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporate apartment building owner sought review of a judgment from the Court of Claims of the State of New York, which, in its suit for money damages due to a regulatory taking by respondent State, awarded it simple interest at the rate of 11 percent on the value of the property on August 1, 1985, for the period from 1985 to 1994, and awarded it 9 percent interest on that amount for the period from 1994 to 2000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ten years before the owner filed its suit, it was determined that the legislature's enactment of 1984 N.Y. Laws 940 constituted a regulatory taking by the State of apartment building units leased to a hospital for sublease to hospital employees. The owner's building was affected by the statute, and the court of claims determined that it was entitled to an award of compensation for the taking pursuant to U.S. Const. Amend. V and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 7(a). On appeal from the interest awarded, the owner argued that a nine-year delay in obtaining just compensation warranted an award of compound rather than simple interest to the aggrieved property owner. The court held that the calculation of interest should have been compounded for the takings period because in order to put the owner in the position it would have been in had the apartments been sold in 1985, it must be awarded compound interest calculated on the 1985 value of the property for the nine-year period during which it was prohibited from terminating the leases and selling the property. The court accepted the 11 percent figure for determining the yearly interest rate that would have been earned on the property's sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the judgment should be modified, on the law, so as to award the owner a money judgment representing a calculation of compound interest at the rate of 11 percent on the value of the property on August 1, 1985, for the period from August 1, 1985 to October 20, 1994, and otherwise affirmed, without costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Interest on Award -- Regulatory Taking -- Compound Interest Warranted Because of Long Delay in Obtaining Just Compensation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claimant, the owner of condominium units formerly leased to a hospital that were subject to an unconstitutional regulatory taking for a nine-year period by virtue of a statute that deemed the hospital's employee subtenants to be qualifed primary tenants for purposes of lease renewal under the Rent Stablization Law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 1984, ch 940), was entitled to an award of compound rather than simple interest for the takings period in view of the long delay in obtaining just compensation. Just compensation included the interest claimant would have earned on the sale proceeds had the taking not occurred, calculated from the time of the taking. In order to put claimant in the same position it would have been in had the apartments been sold in 1985 and thus ensure just compensation, claimant was entitled to an award of compound interest at an 11% yearly rate calculated on the 1985 value of the property for the nine-year period during which it was prohibited from terminating the leases and selling the property. Claimant was entitled to the amount it would have earned had it sold the apartments in 1985 and invested the money as a prudent investor would have done, including reinvesting the interest earned on that investment. Furthermore, the award of compound interest is limited to the period up to the date the statute that created the regulatory taking was declared unconstitutional in 1994. Claimant was entitled to an award of simple interest at the annual rate of 9% for the ensuing six-year period until the date of the initial money judgment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a City, its Mayor, its city planning director, and its buildings commissioner (City), appealed from two judgments denying their cross-motions for summary judgment, granting plaintiff adult establishments' summary judgment motions, declaring the 2001Adult Use Amendments to the 1995 Adult Use Zoning Ordinance unconstitutional, and permanently enjoining their enforcement. The appeal was transferred by the New York Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The establishments argued that the City failed to generate any new empirical data as to the adverse secondary effects of adult establishments. The appellate court held that there was sufficient evidence that adult businesses had an adverse secondary effect. The City properly considered other jurisdictions' studies. The establishments did not show any basis to question those findings. The City also conducted studies of its own. That the bulk of the local studies contained anecdotal evidence did not render them worthless. The City Council reasonably believed that the nature of the 60/40 establishments, with a predominant focus on sexually explicit materials and/or featuring topless or nude women, remained unchanged and that the 2001 amendments were necessary to effectuate the original legislative purpose. There was not an unconstitutional taking as none of the establishments applied for an extension of the amortization period. Moreover, they all remained in operation pending the appeal. Finally, the amendments were not unconstitutionally vague as they did not suppress or greatly restrict access to lawful speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments were reversed. The establishments' motions were denied, defendants' cross motions were granted, the injunction was vacated, and the amendments were declared constitutional. The complaints were otherwise dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Zoning Amendments Geographically Restricting Adult Entertainment Establishments</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2001 Adult Use Amendments to defendant City of New York's 1995 Adult Use Zoning Ordinance, which redefined and broadened the definitions with respect to &quot;adult establishments&quot; subject to regulation as to location, are constitutional. Supreme Court thus erred in declaring the amendments facially unconstitutional for regulating constitutionally protected expression without providing a rational basis for their adoption. The amendments were intended to clarify and affirm the intent of the 1995 ordinance by classifying as &quot;adult establishments&quot; any eating or drinking establishments or theaters that regularly featured adult entertainment, regardless of the portion of the floor area devoted to such entertainment, and establishing additional objective factors relating to the physical layout and operation for adult bookstores under the &quot;60/40&quot; substantial portion test. Defendant, in amending the 1995 ordinance, was not required to generate any new empirical data regarding the purported adverse secondary effects of &quot;60/40&quot; adult establishments. Rather, defendant was entitled to rely on the same Department of City Planning report it used in support of the original valid zoning restrictions. That report documented the link between adult businesses and negative secondary impacts, and thus provided a rational basis for the amendments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the State of New York, appealed an order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which partially granted a cross-motion by defendant property purchaser for, inter alia, summary judgment dismissal of the complaint against him. The State sought recovery of remediation costs. The trial court also held that defendant daughter in law (DIL) was entitled to a hearing on the reasonableness of the costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchaser bought property and then sold it, by oral land contract, to his DIL. The DIL leased the property, which had a store and a gas station on the premises. Thereafter, the DIL arranged to remove the underground petroleum storage tanks in order to perform an environmental assessment of the property. When contamination was suspected, the DIL commenced remediation, but soon requested the State to proceed. The State expended funds to perform the remediation, pursuant to N.Y. Nav. Law &sect; 179, and it filed an action, seeking reimbursement. The trial court granted summary judgment dismissal of the complaint as against the purchaser, and granted summary judgment to the State as against the DIL. The trial court indicated that the DIL was entitled to a hearing to determine the reasonableness of the remediation costs. On appeal, the court held that it was error to dismiss the complaint against the purchaser, as he had control of the use of the property, which was sufficient for purposes of liability under N.Y. Nav. Law &sect; 181. Further, the DIL was not entitled to a hearing on the costs, as there were adequate due process safeguards. Constitutional challenges to &sect; 181 lacked merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the order of the trial court by reversing the partial grant of summary judgment dismissal of the complaint as against the purchaser, and reversing the grant of a hearing on the reasonableness of remediation costs to the DIL. The court granted the State's motion for partial summary judgment against the purchaser, and declared both the purchaser and the DIL liable for remediation costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas and Oil--Oil Spill Cleanup.--Record owner, who sold property by oral land contract to defendant, could be held liable under Navigation Law &sect; 181 for cost of remediation, even in absence of evidence that he caused or contributed to discharge, since he knew that petroleum products were stored on and sold from premises when he acquired title and during his period of ownership, and he could control use of property, and activities which occurred there, through terms of land contract.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas and Oil--Oil Spill Cleanup--Due Process.--Unavailability of hearing to contest reasonableness of remediation costs in action by State seeking reimbursement does not offend due process--State has strong interest in protecting and preserving its lands and waters, and there is equally strong interest in ensuring reimbursement to taxpayer moneys expended in cleaning up polluted sites when discharger is unwilling to do so on his or her own accord; likelihood of erroneous deprivation of discharger's private financial interest is minimized by procedural safeguards combined with availability of CPLR article 78 review which provides dischargers with avenue to challenge costs associated with remediation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas and Oil--Oil Spill Cleanup--Constitutionality.--Statutory scheme which allows State to recover costs of remediation from discharger is not unconstitutional--since statute authorizes discharger to undertake remediation without admitting liability, discharger is in position to control costs of remediation; State's waiver of immunity with respect to claims alleging willful, unlawful or malicious acts associated with remediation of spill sites, when combined with availability of CPLR article 78 proceeding to review plaintiff's actions, provides sufficient procedural safeguard to dischargers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas Oil--Oil Spill Cleanup--Constitutionality.--Argument that Navigation Law &sect; 172 (8) is unconstitutionally vague for failure to enumerate what omissions could give rise to &quot;discharger&quot; was rejected--while defendants posited hypothetical factual scenario in support of their argument, vagueness challenges are addresses based on facts of case, not hypothetical scenarios.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1999 the Westchester County Board of Legislators enacted the Westchester County Solid Waste and Recyclables Collection Licensing Law to regulate the collection and disposal of solid waste and recyclables in the county. Section 826-a.306(2)(b) of the Laws of Westchester County imposed a $ 20,000 per station annual fee on any licensee who owned, leased, operated, or controlled a transfer station that processed recyclables. The licensee filed suit seeking a declaration that the transfer station fee was unconstitutional because the fee was greater than a sum reasonably necessary to cover the costs of issuance, inspection, and enforcement and, therefore, constituted an unauthorized tax. The supreme court dismissed the cause of action as time-barred. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that because the licensee's challenge to the constitutionality of the local law could have been brought pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, the court erred in dismissing the action as barred by the four-month period of limitation under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 217.</SPAN></P>

The trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying defendants' request to call an expert witness on identification.

The Division issued a notice of determination and demand to the taxpayer for payment of sales and use taxes. The transaction was not exempt from the payment of sales and use taxes under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1141(c). That was because the transaction was a bulk sale under former N.Y. U.C.C. art. 6 and was not a sale, transfer, or assignment of business assets in settlement or realization of a valid lien, mortgage, or other security interest, an exception under N.Y. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section &sect; 27-0923 imposed special assessments on generation and disposal of hazardous wastes in the state. The taxpayer argued that an exclusion from disposal assessments for those who paid the generation tax in effect discriminated against out-of-state producers whose wastes were disposed of in New York State. The appellate court agreed that the provision discriminated against interstate commerce because it was not equivalent to a compensatory or complementary tax, but, in accord with the statute's severability clause, did not find it entirely invalid. It invalidated the generation assessment, but went on to uphold the disposal assessment, which became applicable to all taxpayers involved with hazardous wastes. There was no due process denial in limiting the taxpayer's refunds to those claimed within the time limit prescribed by N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1087, even though the limitations period was relatively short, because New York's tax laws provided a pre-deprivation (that is, declaratory judgment) remedy as well as the post-deprivation remedy of a refund.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The funding mechanism of the State's Hazardous Waste Remedial Fund, which provides for special assessments on certain hazardous waste either generated or disposed of in New York (ECL 27-0923; State Finance Law &sect; 97-b), is partially invalid under the Commerce Clause. ECL 27-0923 (2) (d) and (3) are facially discriminatory against interstate commence to the extent that those portions of the &quot;Superfund&quot; statute, as applied by defendants, afford preferential treatment to intrastate hazardous waste over interstate hazardous waste. ECL 27-0923 (3) (c) is facially unconstitutional to the extent that it exempts from taxation hazardous waste resulting from remediation of in-state inactive hazardous waste sites without affording a similar exemption to remediation of similar out-of-state inactive hazardous waste sites. ECL 27-0923 (2) (d) is likewise unconstitutional to the extent that it exempts from taxation the disposal of hazardous waste generated in New York that has been taxed pursuant to ECL 27-0923 (1), without exempting from taxation the disposal of hazardous waste generated in another state that has been taxed pursuant to any other state's similar generation tax. Moreover, since the challenged statutory provisions do not impose sales or use taxes, they cannot be validated under the Commerce Clause as imposing compensatory taxes.</SPAN></P>

To the extent that plaintiff would be entitled to such relief, it must avail itself of the remedies available under article 27 of the Tax Law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff accident victim sued defendants, the lessee and lessor of a pickup truck, for negligence. The Supreme Court, Niagara County, New York, granted plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment and ruled that the lessee's negligence was the sole proximate cause of the accident. A jury awarded plaintiff $ 800,000 in damages; the lessor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was sunbathing in the driveway of her family's home when she was accidently run over by a pickup truck driven by the lessee, her father. The appellate court held that the trial court erred in granting plaintiff partial summary judgment as there were triable issues of fact with regard to her culpable conduct and causation. The damage award of $ 650,000 for past pain and suffering and $ 100,000 for future pain and suffering did not deviate materially from what would be reasonable compensation. N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 388 did not violate due process as applied to long-term vehicle lessors, as one of its purposes was to ensure that persons injured by the negligent operation of a vehicle would have recourse to a financially responsible person, which was a valid governmental purpose, and imposing liability on lessors for the negligence of lessees was a reasonable means of accomplishing this objective. Section 388 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, as it was rational for the legislature to distinguish between vehicle owners, including long-term lessors, and nonowners, including lienholders, and to allocate the statutory burdens based on that distinction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The damage award was reasonable. The trial court's ruling that the lessee was negligent was affirmed, but the partial summary judgment was reversed and a new trial was granted on the issues of plaintiff's alleged culpable conduct and the causal relationship, if any, between such conduct and the accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general counsel to the Commission discovered that neither the corporation nor its sponsor were licensed boxing promoters in New York.

The Commission was vested with the sole direction, management, control, and jurisdiction over all boxing matches or exhibitions conducted within the State of New York. To obtain an exemption under N.Y. Unconsol. Law ch. 7, &sect; 31, a contest holder had to come within one of the three categories of exceptions. Since the corporation was not a military or educational institution, it could only qualify under the remaining exception if it met certain criteria such as demonstrating that its contests were conducted under the supervision of the USA Boxing association and complied with the association's rules for amateur events. Because the corporation did not so qualify, it was subject to the rules of the Commission.

Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 540.6(a)(1) was null, void, and of no effect on the ground of unconstitutionality, defendants appealed from an order of the Suffolk County Supreme Court (New York), which converted the instant action to a N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that since the instant action should have been filed under N.Y.

On appeal, the court first held that defendants had the burden to assert the statute of limitations as a defense, and that defendants failed in such burden. A series of ambiguous communications between the parties occurred. Since any ambiguity created by defendants had to be resolved against them, and since the date of the last letter from plaintiffs was the earliest date from which the limitations period could run, the proceeding was timely commenced. Moreover, after defendants established a prima facie case for summary judgment, plaintiffs raised a triable issue of fact regarding whether defendants' denial of reimbursement under N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 540.6(a)(1) was due to circumstances beyond plaintiffs' control, and whether exceptions to the statute made by defendants were arbitrary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, the County Court, Rensselaer County (New York), convicted defendant of the crimes of stalking in the second degree and criminal contempt in the second degree (nine counts).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the letters he sent to the victim constituted protected speech and, as such, the stalking statute was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the statute was not unconstitutional. Threatening conduct causing fear of physical harm was not protected speech, and the criminal statute proscribing such activity, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 120.50(3), did not implicate the 1st and 14th Amendments of the United States Constitution or N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Further, defendant's remedy for challenging the constitutionality of his prior conviction was upon direct appeal from such conviction or by way of a motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10. Finally, the elements of stalking in the second degree and criminal contempt in the first degree were not identical, and it was altogether possible to commit the former without committing the latter. As such, the jury could have found defendant guilty of the former and not guilty of the latter without such determinations being repugnant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Stalking.--Defendant's contention that his conviction for stalking in second degree must be reversed because predicate offense relied upon to enhance crime with which he was charged (from misdemeanor to felony) was constitutionally infirm was rejected since there was no provision for defendant to challenge constitutionally of previous conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Monroe County Court (New York) for murder in the first degree after defendant pled guilty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted by the grand jury for charges relating to a murder that occurred during the commission of a robbery. The People filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 250.40(1). Defendant appeared to enter a plea of guilty. Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, defendant would be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Before entering his plea, defendant signed a plea agreement outlining the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty. Following the colloquy, but before defendant entered his plea, the prosecutor handed a letter to the court which indicated the notice of intent was withdrawn contingent upon defendant's plea. The appellate court held that although the issues were not preserved for review, it would review them in the interest of justice. The notice of intent was still &quot;pending&quot; when defendant pled guilty and, consequently, the trial court lacked the power to accept his plea. Since defendant's plea was a condition precedent to the withdrawal of the notice of intent, which did not become effective unless and until defendant entered his plea, the notice of intent was still pending.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's waiver of the right to appeal executed in connection with his guilty plea to murder in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [vii]) did not preclude him from challenging the validity of the plea on the ground that the plea was statutorily invalid because the People had not properly withdrawn the notice of intent to seek the death penalty (CPL 250.40 [1]) before entry of the plea. The issues raised by defendant involved matters of &quot;societal concern&quot; with implications for the integrity of the criminal justice system, and were thus not waivable.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Review -- Validity of Guilty Plea to Murder in First Degree </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's contention on appeal that his guilty plea to murder in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [vii]) was statutorily invalid because the People had not properly withdrawn the notice of intent to seek the death penalty (CPL 250.40 [1]) before entry of the plea was not preserved for review. Defendant failed to move to withdraw the plea or vacate the judgment of conviction. However, the appeal was entertained as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPL 470.15 [6] [a]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Murder -- Statutorily Invalid Guilty Plea -- Ineffective Withdrawal of Notice of Intent to Seek Death Penalty before Entry of Plea </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant's conviction of murder in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [vii]) based upon his guilty plea for which he received a sentence of life imprisonment without parole was reversed and the plea vacated because the People had not properly withdrawn the notice of intent to seek the death penalty (CPL 250.40 [1]) before entry of the plea. The prosecutor submitted to the court a written withdrawal of the notice of intent that was &quot;conditioned&quot; on defendant's plea of guilty and the court's acceptance of that plea. Defendant's plea was thus a condition precedent to the withdrawal of the notice of intent, which did not become effective unless and until defendant entered his plea. At the time of his plea defendant was therefore faced with the unconstitutional choice of either exercising his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights and risking death, or abandoning those rights and avoiding the possibility of death. Under these circumstances, the notice of intent was still &quot;pending&quot; at the time of defendant's plea, and the court thus lacked the statutory authority to accept defendant's plea. In any event, the People did not comply with the filing requirements of CPL 250.40 (4) in attempting to withdraw the notice of intent. Submitting the written withdrawal to the judge did not constitute a proper &quot;filing&quot; of the withdrawal with the court prior to the entry of defendant's plea.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a boat storage and repair facility and its owner, appealed from an order of the Supreme Court in Sullivan County (New York), which dismissed plaintiffs' complaint against defendants, the County, its sheriff and one of its deputies. The complaint sought relief under several theories, including liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&nbsp;1983. A &sect; 1983 action against defendant boat owner was also dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose between plaintiffs and the boat owner about repairs and storage of the boat owner's vessel. Plaintiffs refused to release the vessel until they received payment completed repair work. The boat owner filed a complaint with the sheriff's office, asserting that the facility owner took her vessel without her consent. Plaintiffs relinquished the vessel after the repair facility owner was threatened with prosecution. Plaintiffs lawsuit was filed thereafter. The court affirmed dismissal of the complaint. While plaintiffs might have had a valid lien on the vessel, they failed to plead sufficient facts to support a claim of deprivation of that right without due process of law. The boat owner's complaint gave the sheriff and deputy probable cause to take action against the facility owner. The County could not be held liable on a theory of respondeat superior, and plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that some affirmative policy or custom on the part of the County caused the alleged constitutional deprivation. The action against the boat owner failed, as there was no evidence that she contributed to the governmental actions beyond filing her complaint with the sheriff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the &sect; 1983 claims was affirmed. The remainder of the dismissed claims were not considered, as they had been abandoned by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was awarded benefits for a permanent partial disability after sustaining injuries to her neck and shoulder in a work-related accident in 1993. The case was reopened in 2001 following, among other things, an objection by the employer's workers' compensation carrier to the worker's request for authorization of treatment by a licensed massage therapist. The workers' compensation law judge determined that the treatment was not authorized by N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law &sect; 13-b, and the Board affirmed. N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law &sect; 13-b prohibited medical providers from rendering care and treatment to recipients of workers' compensation benefits unless the providers were expressly authorized by the Board, or subject to one of the statutory exceptions listed thereunder. It was undisputed that the instant treating massage therapist was not so authorized. Furthermore, the therapist did not perform the treatment under the active and personal supervision of an authorized physician or under other circumstances that would warrant a finding that massage therapy was explicitly or impliedly authorized by the statute. Thus, the Board properly denied the benefits sought by the worker.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, respondents, a city and its collection agent, appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), that granted an injunction to petitioner property owner permanently enjoining them from selling or foreclosing on tax liens to which the owner's property was subject.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the owner bought the property in a foreclosure sale, it bought it subject to large property tax arrearages, and it reached an agreement with the city regarding a payment schedule. When the owner fell behind on its payment schedule, sought to proceed with subdivision of the property, and discovered that the property was subject to tax liens, some of which had already been sold by the city, the owner claimed to have had a different understanding of the payment agreement and sought to enjoin further sales of tax liens and the foreclosure of any of them. The trial court credited the owner's account of its claimed misunderstanding, but the appellate court held that the trial court lacked the power to enjoin the sales and foreclosures just as the city would have lacked the authority to enter such an agreement. New York's Constitution forbade the bestowal of private gifts by government, and what amounted to interest-free financing of delinquent taxes would have amounted to just such a gift. Unless a statutory exemption existed, taxes simply had to be paid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, denied the petition for injunctive relief, and dismissed the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation--Tax Liens, Tax Sales and Tax Titles.--Petitioner real estate development corporation, which purchased property at mortgage foreclosure sale, was not entitled to have respondent city permanently enjoined from selling or foreclosing on certain tax liens apportioned against petitioner since court did not have authority to invalidate decade-old tax lien, notwithstanding alleged ambiguity of agreement respondent drafted and entered into with prior owner in effort to avoid foreclosure; all real property taxes and assessments and interest imposed thereon were, by operation of law, liens upon real estate and &quot;shall continue to be, until paid&quot; (Administrative Code &sect; 11-301)--while Administrative Code &sect; 11-405 authorized forbearance agreements with delinquent taxpayers, these agreements set up payment plan that postpones foreclosure for so long as required payments are made--estoppel is not generally available against government agency to prevent it from carrying out its statutory duties, especially when duty involves taxation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation--Tax Liens, Tax Sales and Tax Titles.--Allegedly ambiguous clause of agreement which petitioner allegedly relied upon to its detriment when it purchased property at foreclosure sale should not be construed against city since city was not party to judgment of foreclosure and sale whereby petitioner assumed obligations of agreement, agreement did not purport to be statement of property's tax account at time of purchase of property, petitioner's title company representative was sent tax bill reflecting arrears of principal and accrued interest as of day prior to closing, and all tax bills and delinquency notices sent to petitioner since it purchased property showed exact amount of arrears which differed from any computation that could be made pursuant to petitioner's interpretation of agreement.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a television talk show guest, her mother, and her grandmother, appealed from the judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), that granted a motion by defendants, a talk show and its staff, to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211(a)(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint asserted that, in response to a televised solicitation aired during the show, the guest's mother contacted the show by telephone and explained that she was the mother of an out-of-control teen, specifically, the guest. The guest conceded not only that she was no longer in the staff's custody at the time of the alleged assault. The record revealed that the taping had ended hours earlier, her mother and her legal guardian had resumed control over her and were supervising her in their hotel room at the time a staff driver initially made his attempt to contact the guest, and they were still supervising her when the guest later absconded from her guardians. The guest was not released without further supervision, but directly into the custody and supervision of her mother and grandmother, into a situation which was not foreseeably hazardous or in any way presented an immediate risk to her safety. As such, her complaint was devoid of any allegations concerning the essential element of negligent supervision that the employer knew, or should have known, of the employee's propensity for the sort of conduct which caused the injury, or the identity of the employees involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff, a teenager who was allegedly raped by defendants' &quot;limo driver&quot; after she appeared on defendants' talk show television program as an &quot;out-of-control&quot; minor with emotional difficulties, failed to state a negligent supervision cause of action against defendants. Defendants owed no duty of care to plaintiff at the time of the alleged attack, which occurred after plaintiff had been released from defendant's physical custody and control and returned directly into the custody and supervision of her mother and grandmother into a situation which was not foreseeably hazardous, or in any way presented an immediate risk to her safety. A temporary custodian does not have a continuing duty to protect a child from harm once that child has been returned to the custody of a parent or guardian. </SPAN></P>

Plaintiff, a teenager who was allegedly raped by defendants' &quot;limo driver&quot; after she appeared on defendants' talk show television program as an &quot;out-of-control&quot; minor with emotional difficulties, failed to state a cause of action against defendants for negligent hiring and retention in the absence of any allegations that defendants knew, or should have known, of their employee's propensity for the type of conduct that caused plaintiff's injury. Furthermore, plaintiff failed to identify the employee involved, and failed to establish that additional discovery was necessary to cure the pleading deficiencies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Negligence -- Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff, a teenager who was allegedly raped by defendants' &quot;limo driver&quot; after she appeared on defendants' talk show television program as an &quot;out-of-control&quot; minor with emotional difficulties, failed to state a cause of action against defendants for negligent infliction of emotional distress. A cause of action for either intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress must be supported by allegations of conduct by the defendants so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Plaintiff's allegations that defendants suggested she act provocatively, and allowed her to be introduced to a purported rapist, with whom she had a later, voluntary meeting, well after she was no longer in the physical custody of defendants, did not rise to the level of conduct necessary to sustain either cause of action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Negligence -- Violation of Statutory Duty -- Endangering Welfare of Child </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff, a teenager who was allegedly raped by defendants' &quot;limo driver&quot; after she appeared on defendants' talk show television program as an &quot;out-of-control&quot; minor with emotional difficulties, failed to state a cause of action against defendants for negligence per se based upon a violation of the endangering the welfare of a child statute (Penal Law &sect; 260.10 [1]). Since the statute only sets forth a general, abstract standard prohibiting individuals from knowingly engaging in acts likely to be injurious to the physical, mental or moral welfare of a minor, without specifically defining those acts, it cannot support a claim for negligence per se.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matrimonial litigant gave her attorney two mortgages over a decade prior to the enactment of 2002 N.Y. Laws 71. The mortgages were given in 1988 and 1991 to secure payment for a debt in connection with legal services provided by the attorney in a divorce action, which settled in August 1994. 2002 N.Y. Laws 71 was enacted on May 21, 2002, and took effect immediately. It was intended primarily to prohibit the foreclosure of all mortgages given to secure payment of legal fees in matrimonial actions, including those obtained prior to the effective date of the rule. On appeal, the court found that 2002 N.Y. Laws 71 operated as a substantial impairment of the parties' contractual rights under the mortgages, which concededly were legal at the time they were given. Furthermore, 2002 N.Y. Laws 71 delayed foreclosure indefinitely and did not provide an alternate remedy, causing a sever impact on the value of the mortgages. Therefore, 2002 N.Y. Laws 71 constituted an unconstitutional impairment of the contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed, the litigant's motion was denied, the attorney's cross motion was granted, 2002 N.Y. Laws 71 was declared unconstitutional, and the matter was remitted to the supreme court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Contract Clause -- Substantial Impairment of Contractual Rights -- Retroactive Statutory Prohibition on Attorney's Foreclosure of Mortgage Given by Client in Domestic Relations Matter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff was not precluded by chapter 71 of the Laws of 2002 from foreclosing on two mortgages executed by defendant in 1988 and 1991 in favor of her attorney (plaintiff's predecessor) to secure payment for a debt in connection with legal services provided in a divorce action which settled in August 1994. The court rule prohibiting foreclosure of a mortgage taken on a client's primary residence by an attorney in a domestic relations matter (22 NYCRR 1400.5 [b]; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see also</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Code of Professional Responsibility DR 2-106 [c] [2] [iii] [22 NYCRR 1200.11 (c) (2) (iii)]) was inapplicable since plaintiff's predecessor commenced representation of defendant prior to the rule's November 30, 1993 effective date. Chapter 71, which expanded the prohibition to include mortgages obtained prior to the effective date of the court rule, is unconstitutional under the Contract Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 10) as applied to plaintiff, and thus did not bar plaintiff's foreclosure action. The statute, which delays foreclosure indefinitely for as long as the mortgagor chooses to retain the mortgaged property as a primary residence, without providing an alternate remedy for satisfying the debt, operated as a substantial impairment of the parties' contractual rights under the mortgages, which were legal at the time they were given. Furthermore, the fact that the legal profession is closely regulated did not preclude a finding of substantial impairment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, taxpayers and others, challenged an order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which granted the cross motions for summary judgment filed by defendants, the governor and others, and dismissed the taxpayers' complaint that challenged the constitutionality of 2001 N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged bill authorized the governor to enter into tribal-state compacts for casino gaming activities on Indian lands, 2001 N.Y. Laws 383, pt. B, pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2701-2721, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1166-1168; permitted video lottery gaming, 2001 N.Y. Laws 383, pt.

Affirming in part but modifying in part, the court held that (1) because New York permitted the gaming activities authorized by 2001 N.Y. Laws 383, pt. B for charitable purposes, subject to heavy regulation, the gaming was properly the subject of a tribal-state compact; (2) video lottery gaming constituted a valid, state-operated lottery and was excepted from the general ban on gambling, but the requirement that vendor fees be dedicated to breeding funds violated the constitutional mandate that &quot;the net proceeds&quot; be applied exclusively to education under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 9(1); and (3) New York retained sufficient control over the multistate lottery within its borders to meet the requirement that lotteries be &quot;operated by the State&quot; under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Messages of Necessity </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Legislation authorizing the Governor to enter into tribal-state compacts with Indian tribes to allow casino gaming on Indian lands and also authorizing the Division of the Lottery to license and implement the operation of video lottery gaming at certain pari-mutuel racetracks, as well as to operate, administer and enter into agreements for multistate lotteries within the state in cooperation with government-authorized lotteries of one or more jurisdictions (L 2001, ch 383) was validly enacted in conformance with the constitutional requirement of a &quot;message of necessity&quot; from the Governor for an immediate vote by the Legislature. The &quot;message of necessity&quot; provision requires that a bill in final form be on legislators' desks for &quot;at least three calendar legislative days [before] final passage, unless the governor ... shall have certified ... the facts which ... necessitate an immediate vote thereon&quot; (N.Y. Const., art III, &sect; 14). The Governor's &quot;message of necessity&quot; indicated that &quot;[b]ecause the bills have not been on your desks in final form for three calendar legislative days, the Leaders of your Honorable Bodies have requested this message to permit their immediate consideration.&quot; It further stated that the &quot;facts necessitating an immediate vote on the bills&quot; are that the &quot;bills are necessary to enact certain provisions of law.&quot; The &quot;message of necessity&quot; literally and reasonably conformed with the constitutional requirements. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Casino Gaming on Indian Lands Pursuant to Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Legislation authorizing the Governor to enter into tribal-state compacts with Indian tribes to allow class III casino gaming on Indian lands (L 2001, ch 383, part B) pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) (25 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2701-2721; 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1166-1168) was not violative of the State's constitutional prohibition against commercialized gambling activities (N.Y. Const., art I, &sect; 9). IGRA authorizes a state to enter into tribal-state compacts permitting particular class III, casino-type gaming activities (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;25 U.S.C. &sect; 2703 [8]) on tribal lands so long as the state &quot;permits such gaming for any purpose by any person, organization, or entity&quot; (25 U.S.C. &sect; 2710 [d] [1] [B]). Under IGRA, class III games that are not criminally prohibited by state laws are properly the subject of negotiation in tribal-state compacts even if those games are heavily regulated and permitted to be played only by charities. Because New York permits casino gaming activities for charitable purposes, subject to heavy regulation (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;General Municipal Law &sect; 186 [3]; 9 NYCRR 5620.1), the gaming was properly the subject of a tribal-state compact. Furthermore, the legislation did not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the Governor. The fact that the statute leaves discretion to the Governor in negotiating compacts with Indian tribes merely permits compliance with the State's obligation to engage in good-faith negotiations (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;25 U.S.C. &sect; 2710 [d] [3] [A]). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Lotteries -- Video Lottery Gaming -- Constitutionality of Operation of Video Lottery Terminals at Pari-mutuel Racetracks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Legislation authorizing the Division of the Lottery to license and implement the operation of video lottery terminals (VLTs) at certain pari-mutuel racetracks (L 2001, ch 383, part C; Tax Law &sect; 1617-a) was not violative of the State's constitutional prohibition against commercialized gambling activities. VLTs do not fall within the definition of illegal slot machines (Penal Law &sect; 225.00 [8]). Even though VLTs outwardly resemble slot machines, video lottery gaming, as implemented by the Division, falls within the constitutional exception to the general ban on gambling for state-operated &quot;lotteries&quot; (N.Y. Const., art I, &sect; 9 [1]). The games offered on VLTs involve the elements of consideration, chance, prize, tickets and multiple participation necessary to constitute &quot;lotteries&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 225.00 [10]). Play on VLTs involves electronic tickets, which are transferred from the central system to site controllers and then to display terminals upon purchase, but which are not printed or reduced to paper. The electronic tickets are thus the functional equivalent of paper tickets. The State Constitution contains no bar to the introduction of new technological methods of delivering lottery tickets to the public. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Lotteries -- Video Lottery Gaming -- Constitutionality of Operation of Video Lottery Terminals at Pari-mutuel Racetracks - Invalidity of Revenue Distribution Scheme </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Legislation authorizing the Division of the Lottery to license and implement the operation of video lottery terminals (VLTs) at certain pari-mutuel racetracks (L 2001, ch 383, part C; Tax Law &sect; 1617-a) was not violative of the State's constitutional prohibition against commercialized gambling activities, since video lottery gaming, as implemented by the Division, fell within the constitutional exception to the general ban on gambling for state-operated &quot;lotteries&quot; (N.Y. Const., art I, &sect; 9 [1]). However, that portion of the law requiring racetracks to transfer a portion of their vendor fees to breeding funds and for the purpose of enhancing purses at the racetracks where VLTs are located (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 2001, ch 383, part C, &sect; 2; Tax Law &sect; 1612 [c] [1]), was violative of the constitutional mandate that &quot;the net proceeds&quot; of state-run lotteries &quot;be applied exclusively to or in aid or support of education in this state.&quot; Reinvestment in breeding funds and enhanced purses is not a reasonable, necessary expense or cost of maintaining VLTs, and thus, funds dedicated for that purpose cannot be deducted from the net proceeds of the lottery without violating the constitutional requirement that lottery revenues be used to support education. Furthermore, the invalid revenue distribution scheme could not be severed to permit the statute to otherwise operate in a constitutional manner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Lotteries -- Validity of Multistate Lotteries -- Compliance with Constitutional Requirement That Net Proceeds from State-Operated Lottery be used Exclusively for Educational Purposes </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Legislation that directed the Division of the Lottery to operate and administer multistate lotteries within the state in cooperation with a government-authorized lottery of one or more jurisdictions (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 2001, ch 383, part D, &sect; 1; Tax Law &sect; 1604 [a]), and further authorized the Director of the Lottery to enter into agreements for a multistate game, fell within the constitutional exception to the general ban on gambling for state-operated &quot;lotteries&quot; (N.Y. Const., art I, &sect; 9 [1]). While certain joint functions and necessary operating costs of the &quot;Mega Millions&quot; multistate lottery game are shared, New York retains sufficient control over the operation of the multistate lottery within its borders (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 21 NYCRR part 2806) to satisfy the constitutional requirement that lotteries be &quot;operated by the state.&quot; Furthermore, the transfer of funds to other states for operational expenses and prizes does not violate the constitutional requirement that the net proceeds from a state-operated lottery be devoted &quot;exclusively to or in aid or support of education in this state.&quot; The funds transferred by New York to other states may be used only for payment of jackpot prizes and reimbursement of preapproved operational expenses. New York funds are not used by other states to reduce their administrative costs or to fund their governmental purposes.  </SPAN></P>

The legislature could reasonably conclude that its interest in fair trials outweighed the benefits of permitting camera coverage. The availability of less restrictive means did not render the content-neutral statute invalid. Section 52 did not abridge the opportunities for the communication of thought in public places, as reporters were free to attend the trial and to report whatever they observed. The claim that there was a right under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 to televise court proceedings was also rejected. Although the New York Constitution was more protective of expressional freedoms than the U.S. Constitution in some respects, there was no precedent for a right of televised access, and art.

Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 470.15(6)(a), and order a new trial on those charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court modified the trial court's judgment by reversing those parts of the judgment that convicted defendant of two counts of attempted murder in the first degree and two counts of reckless endangerment in the first degree, affirmed the judgment as modified, and granted defendant a new trial on the charges of attempted murder and reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Verdict--Inconsistent Verdict.--Defendant failed to preserve for review his contention that verdict was repugnant insofar as he was found guilty of both attempted murder in first-degree and reckless endangerment in first degree--nevertheless, defendant cannot be convicted of intentional and reckless behavior arising from same act and causing same result, and contention is reviewed in interest of justice--judgment modified by reversing those parts convicting defendant of two counts each of attempted murder in first degree and reckless endangerment in first degree.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a resident of the State of Tennessee and employed by a business located in the State of New York. In 1994 and 1995, petitioner spent approximately 25 percent of his time working in New York. He filed nonresident income tax returns, apportioning his income between New York and the Tennessee, to reflect the number of days he spent working in each state. New York's Department of Taxation and Finance determined that 100 percent of petitioner's income was allocable to New York and issued notices of deficiency. The tribunal affirmed the tax assessment and the art. 78 proceeding ensued. Petitioner contended that the &quot;convenience of the employer&quot; test used was inconsistent with N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 631, which focused on the location of where the work was performed, rather than on the location of the employer. The court disagreed and held that New York's reliance on the &quot;convenience of the employer&quot; test to apportion nonresident income was rationally related to its legitimate interest in taxing nonresident income derived from New York sources. The court found there was a nexus with New York sufficient to support taxation of petitioner's income.</SPAN></P>

The governor contended that such conduct ran afoul of the restriction on altering appropriation bills contained in N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor commenced an action in his official capacity, alleging that subsequent to his constitutionally-mandated annual submission of the executive budget, the legislature unconstitutionally (1) amended and altered nine of the 11 budget bills that he had submitted and (2) introduced and passed 37 appropriation bills in an improper attempt to disregard the governor's executive budget and substitute their own. When the legislature altered the governor's appropriation bills in an allegedly unconstitutional manner, the governor was injured, and thus, had standing to sue. Further, the governor was not obligated to exercise his veto power, as argued by the legislature, and thereby further prolong an already stagnant and fractious budget process in order to create judicially cognizable standing. Finally, the legislature's actions in amending nine of the budget bills submitted by the governor and introducing and passing 37 single-purpose appropriation bills violated N.Y. Const. art.

The New York State Assembly and Senate acted unconstitutionally in amending nine of the budget bills submitted by plaintiff Governor in 2001, and introducing and passing 37 single-purpose appropriation bills in violation of NY Constitution, art VII, &sect; 4. Defendants lacked the power to strike the substantive modifiers inserted by plaintiff within his appropriation bills. Such substantive modifiers were part of a gubernatorial appropriation bill and were thus subject to constitutional protection from being altered by the Legislature. Defendants' proper constitutional action was to refuse to pass plaintiff's appropriation bills and induce negotiations, not to alter and amend them and then substitute their own spending plans in the form of 37 single purpose bills.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners commenced a declaratory judgment action and N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, following passage of certain resolutions relating to a solid waste resource recovery facility by respondents, two county board of supervisors. The Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), granted a cross motion by one of the boards for summary judgment, and granted the other board's cross motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two of the claims, petitioners were attempting, in part, to relitigate issues already unsuccessfully litigated in their original complaint, challenging the enabling legislation pursuant to which the facility was built. Those claims were barred by principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel. There was no merit to petitioners' assertion that one of the county's budget note resolutions constituted a contract of county indebtedness for a period longer than the probable useful life of the purpose of the debt. The undisputed purpose of the budget notes was to provide sufficient county funds to pay its contractual share of waste disposal fees. Thus, the purpose of the debt incurred by the budget notes (to pay the monthly disposal fees) would last at least as long as the debt (the budget notes). Also, petitioners' claim that the resolutions violated N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 7 lacked merit because the comptroller would actually be intercepting separate county sales tax revenues (not state sales tax revenues). Petitioners' claim that the home rule resolutions at issue violated N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 8 failed for the same reason.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments--Collateral Estoppel.--In combined proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 and action for declaratory judgment concerning financing and maintenance of solid waste resource recovery facility, petitioners' attempt to relitigate contentions already unsuccessfully litigated in their original 1992 petition/complaint, i.e., &quot;that the Counties' use of taxpayer funds to pay the monthly disposal fees constitutes aiding a public corporation or gifting/loaning to private corporation in violation of NY Constitution, article X, &sect; 5 and NY Constitution, article VIII, &sect; 1,&quot; is entirely barred by collateral estoppel precepts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments--Res Judicata--Collateral Estoppel.--In combined proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 and action for declaratory judgment concerning financing and maintenance of solid waste resource recovery facility, petitioners' challenges, whether new or repeated, to Laws of 1985 (ch 682) and to underlying agreements are completely barred forever by principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations--Home Rule Powers.--In combined proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 and action for declaratory judgment concerning financing and maintenance of solid waste resource recovery facility, petitioners failed to overcome strong presumption of constitutionality attached to challenged resolutions; no merit is shown in petitioners' assertion that Warren County Budget Note Resolutions constitute contract of County indebtedness for period longer than probable useful life of purpose of debt, in violation of NY Contitiution, article VIII, &sect; 2; undisputed purpose of budget notes, which Warren County Board of Supervisors directed County to issue and which were to mature to less than on year, was to provide sufficient County funds to pay its contractual share of disposal fees (since insufficient funds had been appropriated in County budget to cover fees). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations--Home Rule Powers.--In combined proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 and action for declaratory judgment concerning financing and maintenance of solid waste resource recovery facility, there was no merit to contention that Home Rule Resolutions violated NY Constitution, article VII, &sect;&sect; 7 and 8; resolutions merely requested passage of legislation by Legislature and did not themselves take any action contemplated by constitutional provisions, such as paying state money or gifting/lending state money or credit, rendering inapplicable these constitutional provisions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a local finance corporation, appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), that denied its motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants, a receiving corporation and a city, from implementing the Municipal Assistance Corporation Refinancing Act, and from an order that granted the city's motion for summary judgment declaring said Act constitutional as challenged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Act, the local finance corporation, a public authority created to issue debt and provide funding for public services, was to make annual payments to the city. The receiving corporation was created as an assignee of such payments for the purpose of issuing bonds, the proceeds of which were to be used to retire the remaining debt. The finance corporation contended that by exempting payments from the requirement of annual legislative appropriations, the Act in its entirety was unconstitutional. The legislature intended to assure the rating agencies and prospective bond purchasers that there was little or no risk in such investment, thereby assuring the salability of the bonds. Such purpose could be accomplished even with the severance of the offending portion of the Act. Further, since the receiving corporation was assignee of the city's debt, the debt created was that of the receiving corporation, not of the city, which had previously been held to be constitutional. Finally, the finance corporation's requirement to make the annual payments was not inconsistent with the guarantees in N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 3832-a.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lawyers sued defendants in the Supreme Court, New York County (New York) seeking a declaration that N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, &sect; 127.2 was null and void. The trial court found the challenged provision valid, and the lawyers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's administrative judge vacated other trial courts' awards paying the lawyers for representing indigent criminal defendants above N.Y. County Law &sect; 722-b's limit. The appellate court held the awards were within the trial courts' discretion. The statute did not say the legislature thought such awards were administrative acts or that their appellate review was foreclosed. The administrative judge, unlike the appellate court, could not, under N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 21, decide a question argued orally outside his presence. Administrative review of assigned counsel compensation conflicted with N.Y. County Law &sect; 722-b, and, thus, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit 22, &sect; 127.2, purporting to allow such review, had to yield to the statute and conflicted with appellate review of a trial court's order under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5501(c). N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 212(1)'s grant of authority to the administrative judge to supervise trial court administration did not allow review of a judicial act, such as compensating counsel, which was subject to review, if at all, by the appellate court. The administrative judge's orders were subject to appellate review under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5501(c) and 5701.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal -- Appellate Division -- Matters Reviewable--Awards of Legal Fees Pursuant to County Law &sect; 722-b&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exercise of appellate jurisdiction by an administrative judge by modifying orders awarding legal fees pursuant to County Law &sect; 722-b constituted an impermissible intrusion upon the appellate jurisdiction of the Appellate Division and was therefore ultra vires. 22 NYCRR 127.2 (b), providing for such administrative review, is null and void as having been amended in excess of the authority granted to the Chief Administrator of the Courts by the Legislature and the New York Constitution. Nothing in the language of County Law &sect; 722-c suggests that the Legislature either considered the award of additional compensation due to extraordinary circumstances to be a purely administrative act or intended that compensation awards should be foreclosed from appellate review. Whether or not the award of compensation as fixed in County Law &sect; 722-b may be said to be administrative in nature, the exercise of discretion to award fees in excess of the specified amounts constitutes a judicial function subject to review, if at all, by the appellate courts applying the traditional standard of abuse. There is no authority that would condone the transfer of this judicial function to an administrative judge. That the matter of counsel fees may be collateral to the criminal proceeding in which they are awarded does not render fee awards &quot;administrative.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner union sued respondent education board in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding after two public school employees, who were union members, were denied paid leave for up to three days of religious observances as provided in a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The Broome County, New York, Supreme Court dismissed the suit because the provision in the CBA violated the Establishment Clause and was unenforceable. The union appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court decided that the CBA's religious observance provision did not offend the Establishment Clause in that it did not impermissibly advance religion by coercing members of the union to profess a religious belief. The provision imposed no requirements regarding which religious holidays could be invoked and limited the number of such days to three. As such, the provision was more properly viewed as a reasonable &quot;accommodation&quot; of the two employees' religious beliefs, which was not violative of the Establishment Clause. Therefore, the provision was readily distinguishable from the Matter of Port Washington Union Free School District provision, a New York case. The provision in Port Washington not appearing to limit the number of religious holidays that could be taken went beyond reasonable accommodation and instead rose to a level of government pressure to participate in a religious activity, which was considered an obvious indication that the government was endorsing or promoting religion. To the extent Port Washington could be read to prohibit any religious observance clause as violative of the Establishment Clause, the appeals court declined to follow it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff speaker of the state assembly filed an action against defendant governor, challenging the governor's use of a line-item veto against 55 amendments to bills the assembly passed. The Supreme Court, New York County (New York), granted the governor's motion for summary judgment, but allowed the state senate to intervene for purposes of appeal. The speaker and senate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In January 1998, the governor submitted his budget to the state legislature. The legislature made changes to appropriations bills which the governor submitted, but also changed other bills in ways that had the effect of modifying appropriations bills. The governor used a line-item veto to negate those changes and the speaker of the state assembly filed suit, arguing that the governor's use of the line-item veto was unconstitutional. The trial court found that the legislature exceeded its authority under the New York Constitution by changing non-appropriations bills in ways that affected appropriations bills, and it granted the governor's motion for summary judgment. The appellate court held that (1) the legislature's actions violated the non-alteration provision of N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4, and the trial court properly granted the governor's motion for summary judgment; and (2) given the court's conclusion that the legislature's actions were unconstitutional, there was no need to address the speaker's claim that the governor's use of the line-item veto to invalidate the changes was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's order granting the governor's motion for summary judgment and agreed with the trial court that the constitutionality of the governor's use of line-item vetoes in this case need not be addressed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State -- Budget -- Power of Legislature to Alter Governor's Budget Bills </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The 1998 legislative amendments to the Governor's nonappropriation program bills with respect to the spending of appropriated funds unconstitutionally altered the budget bills submitted by the Governor in violation of NY Constitution, art VII, &sect; 4 by reallocating or itemizing certain appropriations or conditioning them on subsequent legislative action. The no-alteration provision restricts the power of the Legislature to alter an appropriation bill submitted by the Governor &quot;except to strike out or reduce items&quot; or to add &quot;items of appropriation provided that such additions are stated separately and distinctly from the original items of the bill and refer each to a single object or purpose.&quot; For purposes of the no-alteration provision, the Governor's &quot;items of appropriation&quot; properly include both the appropriation itself as well as the &quot;when, how or where&quot; directory provisions relating to the appropriation contained in nonappropriation bills. The no-alteration provision prohibits alterations of an appropriation bill by any means, not just by means of an alteration to the bill itself or by passage of a different appropriation measure.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, an estate administrator and others, sought to have defendant New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's denial of a wetlands permit be regarded as a taking of property without just compensation, and an order, pursuant to N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 25-0404, for condemnation proceedings. The Supreme Court, Suffolk County (New York), found that a taking without just compensation had occurred. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent owned the land parcel prior to the enactment of the Tidal Wetlands Act, N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law art. 25, ch. 790 (1973). The appellate court held that that the Department's denial of a permit for a single family dwelling did not constitute a categorical or per se taking of petitioners' property because it was conceded that the property retained at least a five percent residuary value. However, petitioners demonstrated a taking, as they established beyond a reasonable doubt that the regulation and denial of the permit destroyed all but a bare residue of the economic value of the property. The Department failed to rebut the appraiser's pre-regulation value as $ 665,000. It was determined that the residual property value was $ 31,500. Thus, there was a 95 percent reduction in value. Further, the Department's legitimate reasons for regulating tidal wetlands did not prevent petitioners from succeeding on the takings claim. Nor was there a finding of reciprocity of advantage or shared benefit, as petitioners were left with a situation where their only viable choice was to leave the property in its natural state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Tidal Wetlands - Regulatory Taking </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The determination of respondent New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) which denied petitioners a tidal wetlands permit to construct a single family residence on their waterfront property, acquired by decedent in 1962 prior to the enactment of wetlands regulations, did not constitute a per se regulatory taking of petitioners' property where the property retained at least 5% of its preregulation value. A categorical or per se regulatory taking occurs only when a regulation permanently deprives property of all value. However, the reduction of the property's value by 95% from its nonregulated value still constituted a compensable regulatory taking under the applicable balancing test regarding the economic impact the regulation had on the property. Petitioners proved that there existed a strong probability that most, if not all, of the alternative recreational uses for the property proposed by DEC would not have been approved by the local zoning board. Petitioners thus demonstrated that the regulation and denial of the permit caused an almost total loss of the value of the property.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Where the Appellate Division upheld the finding of Supreme Court in a CPLR article 78 proceeding that the denial of petitioners' application for a tidal wetlands permit by the State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) resulted in a compensatory regulatory taking, if the DEC chooses to acquire the property under the exercise of its powers of eminent domain, which is its only option other than granting the permit, any further proceedings to determine compensation to be paid must be conducted in the Court of Claims.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers challenged a judgment of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which, inter alia, in a combined proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 and action for a declaratory judgment, declared N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 301, 301-a to be facially constitutional and which granted respondent state tax commissioner's motion for partial summary judgment, denying the taxpayers' request for a refund of taxes previously paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers had commenced an action to overturn a decision of the state department of taxation, which denied its request for a petroleum business tax (PBT) refund premised on the ground that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 301(a)(1)(ii); 301-a(b)(2), (c)(1)(B) violated the U.S. Commerce Clause. After several appeals and remittals, the tax law was declared to be constitutional, and the taxpayers' requests for refunds were denied. The question before the court was whether the retroactive application of the PBT violated due process and, if so, whether refunds or counsel fees were due. The amendments to the tax law provided for tax credits in response to a prior decision, which had found the PBT tax unconstitutional in violation of interstate commerce. The court held that by making the refunds retroactively available, New York had provided meaningful backward-looking relief to rectify any unconstitutional deprivation. In addition, the taxpayers failed to sustain their burden of demonstrating that the retroactivity provisions were so harsh and oppressive as to transgress the constitutional limitation. Thus, the post-deprivation procedures to rectify the unconstitutional privation were adequate.</SPAN></P>

The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground, among other things, that it was time-barred. The appellate court ruled that since the gravamen of the complaint was to recover damages for inverse condemnation, the three-year statute of limitations set forth in N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 214(4) applied. Contrary to the trial court's determination, the inverse condemnation claim, if any, did not accrue until the town's zoning board reached a final decision regarding his application for area variances. Thus, the trial court erred in determining that the complaint was time-barred. Nevertheless, the cross motion to dismiss the complaint should have been granted on other grounds. The property owner never had an absolute right to build a single-family home on the premises without a variance. Even if the property owner had a cognizable property right, however, his conclusory allegations that the property could not yield an economically reasonable return as it was presently zoned were insufficient to establish an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff limited liability companies sued, inter alia, defendant governor in the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), for a declaration that N.Y. Ltd. Liab. Co. Law &sect; 206 was unconstitutional and to enjoin enforcement of the statute's publication and filing requirements. The trial court declared the statute unconstitutional and granted the injunction, and the governor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies had to publish notice of their formation for six weeks before they could sue. The appellate court held N.Y. Const. art. 10, &sect; 4, did not give them a general right of access to the courts, but only the same right given to a natural person in a similar case, who had no general right. The statute did not violate substantive due process as it did not arbitrarily restrict access to the courts under state law. As to equal protection, the companies were not in a suspect class. Finding the statute violated equal protection because it did not enhance the adjudication of justice did not address whether the statute was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Limiting access to the courts permissibly enforced the statute's goal and did not have to relate to the court system. The statute applied equally to all domestic limited liability companies, and its requirements were imposed on other limited liability business entities. Only the legislature could decide if its publication requirement best gave notice of the companies' formation. The cost of complying with the statute was not shown to be prohibitive or invidiously discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed, the companies' motion for an injunction was denied and the injunction was vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Statute -- Limited Liability Company Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 206 of the Limited Liability Company Law, which requires each limited liability company to publish its articles of organization or comparable specified information for six successive weeks in two local newspapers of the county where the limited liability company has its principal office as a precondition to &quot;maintaining any action or special proceeding&quot; in any New York court, is constitutional.  The IAS court erred in declaring the publication requirement violative of due process for placing a restriction on a limited liability company's access to the courts that is not reasonably related to the objective of enhancing the adjudication of justice. The only relevant inquiry in applying the &quot;rational basis&quot; test is whether the requirements of section 206 are rationally related to the promotion of any legitimate state interest. Section 206 has no direct bearing on the court system or the adjudication of justice, but is merely one of several steps a limited liability company must take in order to enjoy the full scope of its privilege to do business.  Barring the maintenance of court proceedings by limited liability companies that have not complied with the publication requirement is rationally related to the goal of ensuring that those companies actually publish the designated information.  Furthermore, the issue of whether the publication requirement is &quot;necessary&quot; as one of a number of means of disseminating particular information concerning newly formed limited liability companies to members of the public can only be addressed by the Legislature, not the courts.  </SPAN></P>

In his petition, the citizen alleged, among other things, that the laws were unconstitutional and otherwise invalid. The trial court denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding. The appellate court concluded that the exercise of such power must be supported, at the very least, by evidence showing that the atmosphere of the surrounding area would be adversely affected by the presence of such an overnight business. There was insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the existence of a retail business that operated 24 hours a day in the vicinity of a residential area had any detrimental impact on the health, safety, welfare, or morals of the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Probably because another man was using his identification, a warrant was issued for the citizen by South Carolina authorities, although the citizen had never been there and did not resemble the physical description in the warrant. Nonetheless, the citizen was mistakenly detained for nearly a month, and it was not until extradition proceedings were well underway that a New York prosecutor finally contacted South Carolina authorities about the citizen's claims and discovered that they were true. The appellate court held that judicial immunity protected the prosecutors from liability for their acts within the judicial process and that, in any case, as the arrest itself was proper under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 570.34, there could be no liability for such torts as false arrest and imprisonment, as well as malicious prosecution and abuse of process. The purported tort of negligent investigation did not exist. Constitutional torts were another matter. The citizen might recover compensatory, but not punitive, damages from the city under a theory of willful failure to train or supervise employees so as to prepare them for situations such as the citizen's plight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the order to delete that portion of the denial of the motion that related to the complaint against the prosecutors in their individual capacities as well as all the claims that did not relate to constitutional violations. It also deleted the denial of the motion to dismiss the punitive damages claim. The remainder of the challenged order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In an action by plaintiff, who was justifiably arrested pursuant to a valid out-of-state fugitive warrant but allegedly detained for an unreasonably long time, plaintiff's claim alleging defendants' negligent failure to correctly investigate whether plaintiff was the person identified by the warrant should have been dismissed since New York courts do not recognize claims for negligent or malicious investigation.  A plaintiff seeking damages for an injury resulting from a wrongful arrest and detention may not recover under broad general principles of negligence but must proceed by way of the traditional remedies of false arrest and imprisonment. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In an action by plaintiff, who was justifiably arrested pursuant to a valid out-of-state fugitive warrant but allegedly detained for an unreasonably long time, claims alleging false arrest and malicious prosecution against the District Attorney and Assistant District Attorneys should have been dismissed since district attorneys are absolutely immune from civil liability for activities &quot;intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.&quot; Insofar as plaintiff alleges that after his arrest the District Attorney and Assistant District Attorneys failed to obtain his fingerprints and other identifying evidence in order to determine whether he was the fugitive sought, these activities fall within the District Attorney and Assistant District Attorneys' &quot;judicial&quot; capacity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">False Imprisonment - Wrongful Detention </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an action by plaintiff, who was justifiably arrested pursuant to a valid out-of-state fugitive warrant but allegedly detained for an unreasonably long time, plaintiff's claim alleging false imprisonment should have been dismissed since plaintiff's arrest was privileged.  The information in the warrant provided probable cause for plaintiff's arrest, and such finding of justification pursuant to CPL 570.34 constitutes a complete defense to a claim for false arrest and imprisonment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malicious Prosecution - Probable Cause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In an action by plaintiff, who was justifiably arrested pursuant to a valid out-of-state fugitive warrant but allegedly detained for an unreasonably long time, plaintiff's cause of action for malicious prosecution should have been dismissed.  Plaintiff's claim that probable cause was lacking because he differed in height from the actual fugitive by seven inches is without merit.  Further, while out-of-state authorities may have been misled and erred in failing to accurately determine the true identity of the person they named in the fugitive warrant, defendants did not err in determining that plaintiff was the person actually named, and probable cause existed based on the warrant itself without the need for the police to first make further inquiries.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Process - Abuse of Process </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In an action by plaintiff, who was justifiably arrested pursuant to a valid out-of-state fugitive warrant but allegedly detained for an unreasonably long time, plaintiff's cause of action alleging abuse of process should have been dismissed since it is premised on negligence and a claim of negligence cannot support this intentional tort.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Federal Civil Rights Claim </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. Plaintiff, who was justifiably arrested pursuant to a valid out-of-state fugitive warrant but allegedly detained for an unreasonably long time, adequately pleaded a cause of action under 42 USC &sect; 1983 by alleging that defendants' actions deprived him of his rights secured by the 4th, 5th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution.  The District Attorney's Office and the City acted with deliberate indifference to his constitutional rights in failing to adequately train, supervise and discipline their prosecutors, police officers and personnel in matters involving the identification, processing and extradition of persons arrested pursuant to fugitive warrants, and this was the proximate cause of his injuries.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Federal Civil Rights Claim </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. In an action by plaintiff, who was justifiably arrested pursuant to a valid out-of-state fugitive warrant but allegedly detained for an unreasonably long time, the issue of whether the plaintiff's prolonged detention rose to the level of a constitutional deprivation is a question of fact not properly disposed of on a motion to dismiss.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. Plaintiff, who was justifiably arrested pursuant to a valid out-of-state fugitive warrant but allegedly detained for an unreasonably long time, may maintain a claim for damages for deprivation of his rights pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1983 against the City of New York for the conduct of the District Attorney's office, insofar as the District Attorney acted as a New York City policymaker. Although the District Attorney's office is immune from liability under 42 USC &sect; 1983, the City may be subject to liability pursuant thereto for failure to train and supervise its municipal employees. Plaintiff adequately alleged and made a threshold showing that constitutional harm was caused by a failure by the District Attorney's office to train assistant district attorneys and other personnel with regard to proper procedures for determining whether persons detained by them pursuant to fugitive warrants are in fact the persons sought by out-of-state authorities. Moreover, the failure of the District Attorney's office to train for this situation could constitute deliberate indifference sufficient to give rise to municipal liability.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damages - Punitive Damages </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. Plaintiff's claim against various municipal defendants for punitive damages should have been dismissed since defendant City, as a political subdivision of the State of New York, must be presumed immune from punitive damages, absent a clear statement of a contrary legislative intent.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, respondent transit authorities (collectively, the MTA), sought review of judgments from the Supreme Court, New York County (New York). The trial courts, upon motions of petitioners, a public interest group and an automobile club, declared invalid the MTA's notice of public hearings on its budget and vacated a vote of the MTA Board to increase fares and tolls and to close various token booths.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The MTA announced it was ending the 2002 fiscal year with a positive cash balance but that it faced a combined budget deficit for the 2003 and 2004 fiscal years. After holding 10 public hearings, the MTA Board voted to increase fares and tolls. Reports by state and city commissioners were critical of that decision, and petitioners, relying in part on the reports, challenged the notices of public hearings and the increases. Both trial courts vacated the vote of the MTA Board and remanded. The court dismissed the petitions. Petitioners were essentially arguing that the MTA should have stated in its notices that its financial plan allocated the 2002 cost savings to both the 2003 and 2004 fiscal years. However, neither N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1205(7) nor N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1263(9) required such detailed financial disclosures in a notice of public hearing. Despite petitioners' claim that allocating all the 2002 cost savings to 2003 would do away with the need to increase fare and toll increase in 2003, the MTA was not required to devise its budgets on a single-year basis. Moreover, allocating the entire savings to 2003 would only forestall fare and toll increases for a year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed petitioners' requests for relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities -- Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- Notice of Public Hearings on Proposed Changes in Services or Fares </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Proceedings challenging the decisions of respondent Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to raise bus, subway and commuter fares, to close 62 subway token booths and increase bridge and tunnel tolls on the ground that the MTA's notices of public hearings contained incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information are dismissed.  The MTA's notices of public hearings complied in all respects with statutory requirements.  The governing statute does not require that the notice of hearing provide any financial information regarding proposed fare increases or station closings, only that it include the &quot;range of amounts of fare changes under consideration&quot; and a &quot;clear graphic illustration depicting the nature of any closing for such station&quot; (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1263 [9]; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see also</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&sect; 1205 [7]).  Respondent's notices informed the public that the MTA was facing a multibillion dollar deficit over the 2003 and 2004 fiscal years, that various internal measures would reduce that deficit to under $1 billion, and that the proposed fare and toll increases and token booth closures were intended to close the remaining deficit. The statute does not require respondent to disclose that its financial plan called for the allocation of all of the 2002 available cash balances to both the 2003 and 2004 fiscal years.  Furthermore, the record does not support the determinations of the IAS courts that the MTA's 2003 and 2004 deficit was &quot;fictional&quot; or that the MTA notices were otherwise false and misleading. The MTA's failure to specifically inform the public in the notices that its budgetary planning had allocated the 2002 cost-savings to 2003 and 2004, not just to 2003, did not render the notices false or misleading, especially in vew of respondent's statutory obligation to establish five-year financial plans (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Authorities Law &sect; 1269-d).  </SPAN></P>

An administrative law judge determined that, despite the fact that the award had expired, the clause concerning holiday pay defined that aspect of the status quo. After the judgment was affirmed by PERB, the employer filed an appeal. In confirming the decision, the court determined that PERB had jurisdiction over the parties' dispute. Further, the decision of PERB was entitled to deference on appeal because it was a matter resting peculiarly within PERB's expertise. It was not a matter of statutory construction. PERB was merely deciding whether the holiday pay provision in the arbitration award defined the status quo after a certain date.

The appellate term reversed an order from the trial court, which held that the tenants had made a prima facie showing that the Spiegel Law defense under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 143-b applied in an eviction action commenced by respondent landlord.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord commenced a summary proceeding to evict the tenants for nonpayment of rent. The tenants relied on &sect; 143-b(5)(a), which provided that it was a valid defense in an eviction proceeding against a welfare recipient to show existing violations in the building code as a basis for nonpayment of rent. The trial court held, among other things, that the tenants could raise the Spiegel law defense. The appellate term reversed and denied the tenants' summary judgment motion. The court affirmed. In light of the statutory language and legislative history, welfare recipients could only raise the Spiegel Law defense where the appropriate public welfare officials had first exercised the authority to withhold direct rent payments to the landlord based upon the existence of building violations. A contrary holding giving welfare recipients the right to withhold payment of rent for violations that did not directly affect the habitability of the recipient's apartment would unconstitutionally impair the landlord's contractual right to receive payment. The underlying policy goals of &sect; 143-b would best be effectuated by encouraging the wider use of the statute by the proper state officials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Summary Proceedings - Defense of Code Violations Unavailable to Welfare Recipient Where Social Services Agency Continues to Pay Portion of Rent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Social Services Law &sect; 143-b, which authorizes &quot;public welfare officials&quot; to withhold rent payments to landlords on behalf of welfare recipients if the building in which a recipient lives has code violations, and further provides in subdivision (5) that it is &quot;a valid defense&quot; in any nonpayment proceeding against a welfare recipient &quot;to show existing violations&quot; related to dangerous or hazardous conditions in the building where the recipient resides as a basis for the nonpayment, can be raised as a defense by a welfare recipient only where the appropriate social services agency has first acted to withhold direct rent payments to the landlord based upon the existence of code violations in the recipient's building. Consequently, respondent tenants may not assert the statute as a defense to a nonpayment summary proceeding where the New York City Human Resources Administration, which pays a portion of their rent directly to petitioner landlord as their shelter grant, has taken no steps to withhold its share of the rent because of code violations.  The statutory scheme manifests a clear legislative intent to confer the right to withhold rent on social services officials rather than individual welfare recipients. Since only a social services official is permitted under the statute to withhold rent from a landlord who may be providing substandard housing, the statutory defense should apply only in cases where the appropriate official has first exercised this right.  Furthermore, it would be an impermissible impairment of the landlord's contractual right to receive payment to permit individual welfare recipients, rather than welfare officials, to withhold rent payments under the statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nursing home brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding against respondent health department, seeking to vacate audits conducted by the health department. The Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), found that the health department was not required to provide the nursing home with notice and that applicable regulations were not unconstitutional or contrary to due process rights. The nursing home appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the health department began auditing the nursing home's Medicaid reimbursement rates, the nursing home sold the facility. The audits continued, and communications regarding the process were directed to the buyer of the facility. From the audits, the nursing home became liable for overpayment of $ 1 million. The appellate court ruled that when the nursing home sold the facility, it ceased being a &quot;facility.&quot; As the regulations required the health department to communicate with &quot;the facility,&quot; it acted reasonably and according to its regulations by working with the buyer. The nursing home had notice of the audits, and its own actions or inactions resulted in its failure to receive further notice. The nursing home had the chance to make submissions before the on-site review was complete, but relinquished that right by failing to keep apprised of the progress of the audit. Medicaid reimbursement rates were provisional, not vested, and where no constitutionally protected rights existed, there was no entitlement to a hearing when there was a deprivation of such property. The nursing home was afforded all the process it was due.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law guardian appealed the family court judgments terminating the parental rights to the state supreme court, arguing that N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 384-b(3)(i) deprived permanently neglected children of their rights to substantive and procedural due process under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV because it did not require a trial court to consider the likelihood that a child would be adopted before the court issued orders terminating the child's parents' parental rights. The state supreme court transferred the case to the intermediate appellate court on the ground that direct appeal to the supreme court was not appropriate. The intermediate appellate court held that (1) N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 384-b(3)(i) was narrowly tailored to serve the compelling interest of protecting children, and it was constitutional; and (2) evidence which showed that parents did not complete a substance abuse rehabilitation program or a parenting class, had barely any contact with their children, and failed to plan for their children's future supported the family court's finding that terminating the parents' parental rights, and freeing their children for adoption, was in the children's best interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation operated facilities which were charged emission fees under Westchester County, N.Y., Sanitary Code art. 13, &sect; 873.1301 et seq.; art. 21, &sect; 873.2109. The corporation claimed that the fees were an illegal tax, unconstitutional, and inconsistent with the New York Environmental Conservation Law. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in converting the hybrid proceeding and action solely to an action for a declaratory judgment and in denying those branches of the county's motion to dismiss the first and third through ninth causes of action. The corporation's claims set forth in the first and third through ninth causes of action were clearly time-barred. Therefore, the county's motion to dismiss the proceeding as time-barred should have been granted with respect to all the causes of action except the second cause of action, the alleged failure to maintain the records required pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dog owner appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), that granted the motions of defendants, various competitive dog associations, to dismiss the complaint. The associations moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the dog owner did not have the legal capacity to sue, and that he had failed to state a cause of action pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 3211(a)(3), (7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Specifically, the dog owner's amended complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the complained-of standard (1) unlawfully discriminated against the dog owner by effectively precluding him from entering his dog in breed competitions, (2) was arbitrary and capricious, (3) violated N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 353, and (4) was null and void as in derogation of law. He further sought an injunction prohibiting defendants from applying, enforcing, or utilizing the standard. The appellate court found that the claim was made that the associations adopted a standard that promoted, among the owners of Brittany Spaniels raised for competition, a practice that allegedly amounted to the unjustifiable, and therefore illegal, mutilation of the dogs. The appellate court agreed with the associations' contention that the dog owner lacked the standing to obtain any of the civil remedies he sought for the alleged violation of &sect; 353. Because the owner had no individual right to seek civil enforcement of &sect; 353, those portions of his complaint that sought a declaration that the associations' tail standard violated the statute were null and void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Plaintiff's action to preclude defendant kennel clubs from enforcing a tail standard for a certain dog breed that, for judging purposes in sponsored competitions, &quot;severely&quot; penalizes a dog with a tail &quot;substantially more than four inches,&quot; on the ground that the standard promotes animal cruelty in violation of Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353, and effectively excludes his dog, which has an undocked 10-inch long tail, from meaningfully competing in defendants' dog shows, presents a justiciable controversy.  While generally the internal decision making and rule adoption of private organizations, involving the conduct of their members and their activities, are outside the realm in which courts exercise their authority, this general rule of noninterference in an organization's self-governance gives way upon a showing that its adopted rules violate state law. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Plaintiff's action to preclude defendant kennel clubs from enforcing a tail standard for a certain dog breed that, for judging purposes in sponsored competitions, &quot;severely&quot; penalizes a dog with a tail &quot;substantially more than four inches,&quot; on the ground that the standard promotes animal cruelty in violation of Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353, and effectively excludes his dog, which has an undocked 10-inch long tail, from meaningfully competing in defendants' dog shows, is dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. Even if dog tail docking constitutes an unjustified procedure that falls within the statutory animal cruelty prohibition, plaintiff lacks standing to obtain any civil remedy.  Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353 is a criminal statute that can only be enforced by law enforcement agencies, and not private individuals.  Moreover, civil remedies, such as injunctive relief, are not generally available to private individuals to prevent violations of penal statutes.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Plaintiff's allegation that defendant kennel clubs' promulgation of standards for canine tail length constitutes illegal discrimination, lacks merit.

When defendant deliberately fired through a door into a small, enclosed space containing the victim and a bystander, and said &quot;Good,&quot; when told he had hit someone, his depraved indifference murder conviction was sufficiently supported. The jury's rejection of lesser-included second-degree manslaughter made an instruction on the more remote criminally negligent homicide unnecessary. Refusing to require a prosecution witness, on cross-examination, to state names of bar patrons where the shooting occurred was proper because collateral to defendant's defense, and defendant could impeach the witness. The People's impeachment of their own witness was proper, under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 60.35(1), as the witness's unfavorable testimony was on direct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing defendant's convictions, the appellate court found that defendant was convicted and sentenced before the court of appeals issued its decision in Hynes. However, defendant was not affected by the constitutional infirmity of the statutory provisions at issue in Hynes and Harris. Defendant risked death, but suffered no detriment as a result of that risk. Consequently, he could not now raise the issue as to what might have occurred had the jury recommended death. Further, upon examining the individual statements of a prospective juror, in context and as a whole, the appellate court concluded that she gave an unequivocal assurance of impartiality. Additionally, while the appellate court agreed with defendant that two prospective jurors initially seemed confused about the burdens of proof, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's challenges for cause with respect to those prospective jurors. Finally, in denying defendant's Batson challenges, the court thereby implicitly determined that the race-neutral explanations given by the prosecutor for exercising peremptory challenges with respect to those prospective jurors were not pretextual.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In defendant's capital murder prosecution for killing a police officer, defendant's general constitutional challenges to New York's death penalty statutes (Penal Law &sect; 125.27; CPL 400.27) need not be addressed inasmuch as the jury sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without parole. Courts should not address a constitutional issue if the case may be disposed of in another way.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant's specific constitutional challenge to CPL 270.20 (1) (f) for permitting a &quot;death-qualified&quot; jury to determine a capital defendant's guilt or innocence lacks merit.  There is no constitutional prohibition against &quot;death-qualifying&quot; juries in capital cases.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant's capital murder prosecution was not affected by the constitutional infirmity of certain plea bargain provisions of the death penalty statutes (CPL 220.10 [5] [e]; 220.30 [3] [b] [vii]), which were declared unconstitutional after defendant was convicted and sentenced (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Hynes v Tomei,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 92 NY2d 613, 706 N.E.2d 1201, 684 N.Y.S.2d 177, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">cert denied</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;527 US 1015, 144 L. Ed. 2d 254, 119 S. Ct. 2359). Here, defendant risked death, but suffered no detriment as a result of that risk.  The sentence of life imprisonment without parole may also be imposed upon a defendant who pleads guilty.  Consequently, the imposition of that sentence has not unconstitutionally penalized the exercise of defendant's right to trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Jurors - Challenge to Jury - Capital Murder </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Defendant's conviction of murder in the first degree for killing a police officer (Penal Law &sect; 125.27), for which he received a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, is not subject to reversal because of alleged defects in the jury selection process.  Defendant failed to establish an unconstitutional underrepresentation of African-Americans and young people from the lists from which the jury panel was drawn.  In addition, the trial court properly denied defendant's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> challenges.  The court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the prosecutor presented race-neutral explanations for exercising the peremptory challenges with respect to the prospective jurors at issue.  Furthermore, the trial court properly denied several of defendant's challenges of prospective jurors for cause pursuant to CPL 270.20 (1).  Defendant was not &quot;forced&quot; to accept a certain prospective juror when he opted to use his last peremptory challenge to exclude another prospective juror. The court properly granted the People's challenge for cause with respect to four prospective jurors who stated that they would have difficulty taking an active role in imposing the death penalty, and with respect to a prospective juror who failed to disclose a prior conviction of driving while intoxicated and who further stated that she believed that law enforcement officers planted illegal drugs in her vehicle.  The court also properly determined that a sworn juror's expressed conscientious opinion against the death penalty after being sworn rendered her grossly unqualified (CPL 270.35 [1]), thereby warranting her discharge for cause.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Identification of Defendant - Capital Murder - Harmless Error </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In defendant's capital murder prosecution for killing a police officer (Penal Law &sect; 125.27), any error in the admission of the identification testimony of a police officer who was also shot during the incident is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. There is overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, including the identification testimony of two eyewitnesses who personally knew defendant, and the testimony of a witness who saw defendant running down the street seconds after the witness had heard gunshots.  Moreover, although the court erred in allowing the People to use classic front and side profile mugshots of defendant in a photographic array in connection with the testimony of the officer, the error is likewise harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. Similarly, any error in the admission of &quot;resemblance testimony&quot; from a witness for the People is also harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in view of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. Defendant's conviction of murder in the first degree and attempted murder in the first degree is supported by legally sufficient evidence and the verdict is not against the weight of the evidence.  Defendant's intent may be inferred from his actions, as described in the testimony of the People's witnesses.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Appeal - Preservation of Issue for Review </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. Defendant's contention that the trial court erred in failing to inform him of the contents of two jury notes is not preserved for appellate review where defense counsel failed to object at a time when the court could have corrected the alleged error.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. Defendant's contention that the admission of testimony concerning DNA population statistics was without proper foundation and constituted reversible error is rejected.  Defendant's challenges go not to the admissibility but to the weight of the evidence, which should be left to the trier of fact.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Instructions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. In a capital murder prosecution for the murder of a police officer, the court did not err in denying defense counsel's request to recharge the jury with respect to the difference between depraved indifference murder and murder in the first degree.  The court properly explained the difference between the requisite states of mind for those crimes, and the charge as a whole conveyed the proper standard to the jury.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Fair Trial - Capital Murder - Admission of Prior Plea Transcript </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. In defendant's capital murder prosecution for killing a police officer (Penal Law &sect; 125.27) and wounding another, the admission of the plea transcript in a prior proceeding did not deprive defendant of a fair trial.  The People's theory for defendant's motive in shooting at the officers was that defendant was awaiting sentencing on the crimes covered by his guilty plea and wanted to avoid being apprehended for possessing a loaded weapon. The transcript of the prior plea proceeding, which the prosecutor agreed should exclude any mention of the crimes to which defendant pleaded guilty, established that the court had informed defendant that it would not be bound by its sentencing commitment if defendant were arrested between the time of his plea and sentencing. Sentencing in that case was scheduled for two weeks after the shooting herein occurred.  Thus, the plea transcript was admissible on the issue of defendant's motive for shooting at the officers, and the court minimized any prejudice to defendant by instructing the jury that the plea transcript was to be considered only with respect to that issue.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient challenged the judgment entered. The appeals court concluded that N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 9.60 was constitutional, because the brief detention of a noncompliant assisted outpatient for a psychiatric evaluation did not constitute a substantial deprivation of liberty, and the additional safeguard of a judicial hearing would not significantly reduce the possibility of an erroneous removal decision. Moreover, the government had a strong interest in avoiding time-consuming judicial hearings, which required mental health professionals to defend their clinical decisions and divert scarce resources from the diagnosis and treatment of the mentally ill. Similarly, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(14) gave criminal defendants, who were found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect and released subject to an order of conditions, notice and an opportunity to be heard before their recommitment to a secure psychiatric facility. Furthermore, N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 9.60(n) did not require a finding that there was probable cause to believe that an assisted outpatient who failed to comply with an assisted outpatient treatment order was dangerous to himself or others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a consent order, a doctor's license to practice medicine was suspended for two years, the suspension was stayed, and the doctor was placed on probation. In July 2000, the doctor was charged with violating probation by engaging in professional misconduct, including inappropriately diagnosing and excessively treating five patients and fraudulently billing insurance companies for his services. A hearing committee of the New York State Board for Professional Medical Conduct sustained nearly all the charges, and revoked the doctor's license to practice medicine, and the New York State Administrative Review Board for Professional Medical Conduct (ARB) affirmed the hearing committee's decision but increased the penalty imposed on the doctor by imposing a fine of $ 5,000. In the doctor's action seeking judicial review of the ARB's decision, the appellate court held that (1) the record supported the ARB's judgment that the doctor violated his probation and engaged in professional misconduct; (2) the ARB had the authority to impose an additional penalty; and (3) the ARB's judgment revoking the doctor's license was not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant health and hospitals corporation sued respondent city council in the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), seeking to declare a local law passed by the city council invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation wanted to save money by using private security guards in its facilities, rather than licensed peace officers, as the local law required. The appellate court held the legislature impliedly and expressly evinced an intent to preempt the subject matter of the local law. The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation Act was a comprehensive and detailed regulatory scheme to govern the city's health care system. Under &sect; 7405 of the Act, its provisions were controlling over any inconsistent laws, and &sect; 7385(11), (12) of the Act gave the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) autonomy to fix the guards' qualifications. The local law impermissibly prohibited what would have been permissible under state law or, at a minimum, restricted the HHC's rights under state law. The local law was not one of general applicability because it only applied to the HHC, and not to other hospitals in the city, so it did not fit in the &quot;generally applicable&quot; exception to the preemption rule. The local law did not have only a tangential or incidental impact because it affected only security guards who were not health care personnel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the corporation's summary judgment motion was granted to the extent of declaring the local law invalid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws - Preemption by State - Local Law Requiring New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation to Utilize &quot;Peace Officers&quot; as Security Guards </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A local law of the City of New York, which mandates that plaintiff New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) utilize &quot;peace officers&quot; appointed pursuant to CPL 2.10 (40) as security guards (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 17-182), is invalid as an unconstitutional interference with HHC's right, as established by the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation Act (McKinney's Uncons Laws of NY &sect; 7381 [L 1969, ch 1016, &sect; 1, as amended]), to operate autonomously.  The State has both impliedly and expressly evinced an intent to preempt the entire field with regard to the City's hospital system (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uncons Laws &sect; 7405 [Health and Hospitals Corporation Act &sect; 24]), thereby precluding any further local regulation, regardless of whether the local regulation bears a reasonable and substantial relationship to the legitimate purpose of furthering public safety. Even a rational exercise of police power that contravenes controlling state law or is preempted thereby is invalid. The Health and Hospitals Corporation Act gives HHC complete autonomy to fix the security guards' qualifications and replace them (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uncons Laws &sect; 7385 [11], [12] [Health and Hospitals Corporation Act &sect; 5 (11), (12)]).  The requirement that security personnel qualify as peace officers intrudes on HHC's managerial flexibility.  Moreover, the local law does not qualify as an exception to the preemption rule for &quot;generally applicable&quot; local laws that only &quot;incidentally infringe&quot; upon the powers of state created entities. The local law is not a law of general applicability, nor can it be said that it has only a tangential or incidental impact because it affects only security guards who are not health care personnel. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Contrary to the prisoner's contention, the appellate court held there was substantial evidence in the record as a whole, pursuant to N.Y.

Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 7, &sect; 270.2(B)(8)(i). The prisoner challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 7, &sect; 270.2(B)(8)(i), which mandated that an inmate could not physically or verbally obstruct or interfere with an employee at any time, on vagueness grounds. However, an inmate rule was not unconstitutionally vague, if it informed a reasonable person of the nature of the offense prohibited and what was required of him or her. The appellate court held that a reasonable man would have concluded that an inmate's action of throwing a liquid substance on a corrections officer, even if it was only faucet water, would violate N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 7, &sect; 270.2(B)(8)(i), as it would likely have physically interfered with a corrections officer's duties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two proceedings, the Supreme Court, Warren County (New York), granted petitioner corporation's applications, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, to annul determinations of respondent zoning board of appeals, regarding whether the corporation's non-conforming use had been abandoned. The town appealed, and the corporation cross-appealed. The proceedings were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to the first proceeding, the town's zoning officer informed the corporation's predecessor by letter that its batch plant was a permitted use. The zoning ordinance was amended and the property was rezoned residential, with a provision that if a preexisting nonconforming use was abandoned for a year, subsequent uses had to comply with the ordinance. The town alleged the corporation ceased operations for one year. The appellate court held that as the town did not rescind the zoning officer's letter, the corporation was in compliance with the ordinance as it existed when the letter was written. While the corporation's use was legally created, there was no support in the ordinance for the zoning board of appeals' ruling that any abandonment of the nonconforming use had to occur during a certain 12-month period. As to the second proceeding, the trial court erroneously substituted its judgment for that of the zoning board of appeals' finding activities at the site were insufficient to show continued operation of the batch plant for a different 12-month period. Substantial evidence supported the board's finding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to the first proceeding, the trial court's judgment was affirmed. As to the second proceeding, the trial court's judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The city cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The Supreme Court, Rensselaer County, New York, granted the city's cross-motion. The officers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of one police officer's reappointment, he lived in an apartment in the city. The officer purchased a house outside the city limits with the intention of living there.  N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect;&sect; 3(12), 30(6) required police officers to reside within the city limits. The city adopted Troy, N.Y., Code &sect; 24-4 to enforce the requirement. The officer was advised that the failure to abide by the requirement could result in his dismissal. The officers argued that because police officers were public officers, N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect;&sect; 3(12), 30(6) exempted them from being compelled to reside within the city limits despite the authority under N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 30(4)(3). The appellate court held that N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 30(4)(3) regulated the residency of police officers, while N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect;&sect; 3(12), 30(6) regulated generally the class of all other public officers. There was no conflict among N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect;&sect; 3(12), 30(6), and &sect; 30(4)(3). The enactment of Troy, N.Y., Code &sect; 24-4 was not inconsistent with N.Y. Pub. Off.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court, St. Lawrence County (New York), dismissed an application by petitioners, property owners, in a proceeding pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners' only challenge to the determination denying their application for a variance permitting the construction of a six-foot-high privacy fence along their property sideline was that the operative provision of the city land use code, which provided that no property line fence, wall, or other divider could be constructed of a material or to a height that would interfere with the view or useful enjoyment of an adjoining property, was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court held that in order to withstand a due process challenge, it sufficed that the language of an ordinance provided a reasonable degree of certainty so that individuals of ordinary intelligence were not forced to guess as to its meaning. The appellate court held that the provision at issue satisfied that test. The tall solid wood fence constructed by the property owners could be reasonably expected to, and in fact did, interfere with the adjoining neighbor's view of a river, thereby diminishing the value and interfering with the useful enjoyment of the adjoining property. Under the circumstances, the ordinance could be reasonably viewed as prohibiting the property owners' actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer paid sales tax pursuant to N.Y.  Tax. Law &sect; 1111(i)(A) on the total sum due under a 36-month lease for an automobile. After the vehicle was stolen and the lease was terminated prematurely, the New York Division of Taxation denied the taxpayer's claim for a refund. Respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal (New York) sustained the disallowance of the refund claim. The taxpayer sought review in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Division of Taxation had found that there was no provision in New York's Tax Law allowing a refund of sales tax paid on a vehicle lease that was prematurely terminated. The appellate court held that the Tribunal's decision was not arbitrary or capricious.  N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 1101(b), 1105(a) required the collection of sales tax on the transaction since it involved a transfer of possession of tangible personal property for consideration, and the payment up front of the tax for the entire term of the lease was in accordance with N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1111(i)(A). Finally, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 20, &sect; 527.15(e) specifically provided that no refund or credit was allowed based upon the fact that receipts were not actually paid as in the case of early termination of a lease, since, under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1111(i), such receipts were deemed to have been paid. Thus, a refund was not allowed. The taxpayer's reliance on N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1132(e) and regulations promulgated under it was misplaced, as &sect; 1132(e) did not deal with leases or their early termination. Nor was the sales tax erroneously, illegally, or unconstitutionally collected or paid for purposes of N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1139(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1991, the inmate was convicted of attempted murder and was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 7 1/2 to 22 1/2 years. Shortly thereafter, the victim died of her injuries, and the inmate was prosecuted for murder in the second degree under the delayed death exception to New York's statutory double jeopardy prohibition. The inmate was convicted after a jury trial of manslaughter, and in 1995, was sentenced to a concurrent indeterminate prison term of 8 1/3 to 25 years. The inmate argued that his conditional release and maximum expiration dates should have reflected credit for the time he served between 1991 and 1995. The appellate court held that the 1995 sentence was controlling. Thus, the department of corrections correctly credited the inmate's time served from 1991 to 1995 against the minimum period of the 1995 sentence to arrive at his parole eligibility date and properly refused to credit that time against the maximum 25-year term of that sentence. As N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.30(3) did not allow the time served on the inmate's previously imposed 1991 sentence to be credited against the maximum term of his 1995 sentence, there was no error in the computation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Delaware corporation that did business in New York State decided to expand into foreign markets and decided that its foreign businesses should be organized under foreign laws and held by viable corporate subsidiaries created for that purpose.

The parent corporation paid the interest and deducted it as a business expense. After an audit, the New York Department of Taxation and Finance issued a notice of deficiency against the parent corporation and demanded payment of additional tax. Following several levels of administrative review, the New York Tax Appeals Tribunal sustained the notice of deficiency on grounds that the corporation's interest payments to its subsidiary were attributable to subsidiary capital and were nondeductible. The appellate court held that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 208(9)(b)(6) was not void for vagueness and there was no valid basis for disturbing the Tribunal's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor was licensed to practice medicine in New York in 1993. In 1995, he applied for a license to practice medicine in California, an application which was ultimately denied. The California board considered a 1996 psychiatric examination of the doctor, and, following an evidentiary hearing, found that his ability to practice medicine was impaired because he suffered from mental illness. The doctor was charged with professional misconduct based upon the California license refusal, alleging that the conduct underlying it would, if committed in New York, constitute professional misconduct. The hearing committee sustained the charge, and revoked the doctor's license to practice medicine. The administrative review board conducted a referral hearing, and correctly gave collateral estoppel effect to the California decision. The appellate court found that neither the fact that the California proceeding involved a license denial as compared to the suspension of a license, nor the fact that the doctor bore the burden of proof in the California proceeding, but not in the New York proceeding, precluded according collateral estoppel effect to the California determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State appealed the judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), that declared the State's method of funding education violated the Education Article of the New York Constitution and the United States Department of Education's implementing regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000(d) et seq., and directed the State to implement various reforms of school financing and governance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, students, parents, and organizations concerned with education issues, commenced an action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, on the ground that the State's public school financing system violated N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1; U.S. Const. amend. XIV; N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11; N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000(d) et seq.; and 34 C.F.R. &sect; 100.3(B)(2)(p). Originally, the appellate court dismissed the claim under Title VI, since there was no showing of intentional discrimination; however, the appellate court reinstated the claim for violations of Title VI's implementing regulations. On appeal, the appellate court found that there was no evidence that students were unable to perform basic mathematical calculations, and allowing that some amount of history, civics, science, and technology were components of a sound basic education, there was no evidence concerning what that amount should be or what amount was actually being provided. Accordingly, plaintiffs failed to establish that New York City public school children were not receiving the opportunity for a sound basic education.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Constitutionality of State's Public School Financing System </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The State's educational funding system does not contravene the Education Article of the New York State Constitution (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1).  The &quot;sound basic education&quot; standard enunciated by the Court of Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Campaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (86 NY2d 307) requires the State to provide a minimally adequate educational opportunity, but not to guarantee some higher, largely unspecified level of education, as laudable as that goal might be.  A &quot;sound basic education&quot; should consist of the skills necessary to obtain employment, and to competently discharge one's civil responsibilities.  Plaintiffs failed to establish that the New York City public school children are not receiving the opportunity for a sound basic education.  Even if New York City schools do not provide a sound basic education, plaintiffs failed to prove that deficiencies in the City's school system are caused by the State's funding system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Discrimination Cause of Action under Implementing Regulations of Title VI of Civil Rights Act </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The State's educational funding system does not violate the United States Department of Education's implementing regulations under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC &sect; 2000d) which prohibit a recipient of federal financial assistance from &quot;utilizing criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin&quot; (34 CFR 100.3 [b] [2]).  Title VI prohibits intentional discrimination, which is not alleged in the instant case, and there is no private right of action under the implementing regulations, since the empowering statute reveals no congressional intent to create one.  Plaintiffs may not enforce the regulations through 42 USC &sect; 1983, which provides a cause of action for &quot;the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws&quot; by anyone acting &quot;under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State,&quot; and regulations, standing alone, are not &quot;laws&quot; within the meaning of section 1983.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was subject to a child support order.

The father applied to reopen the proceeding after the grandmother's death and the daughter's attainment of majority, but because there was still an arrearage, the hearing examiner simply made the daughter the payee under the existing order. The father argued on appeal that the statute was unconstitutional in failing to allow him a due process hearing before the hearing examiner or in the trial court, but the appellate court held that he had failed to preserve the issue for review, that he had, further, failed to notify the state attorney general of his plan to challenge the constitutionality of a statute, and, finally, that N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was undisputed that in 248 instances the excess line brokers issued separate transportation policies rather than include transportation coverage in the insureds' jeweler's block coverage. It was also undisputed that, had transportation coverage been placed by the brokers under the rubric of jeweler's block coverage, the brokers would have been subject to excess line filing requirements and liable for excess line premium taxes on the placed coverage. The jeweler's block coverage comprised inland marine coverage for items transported by the insured, and it was not a proper practice to issue such transportation coverage under a separate policy and thereby avoid regulatory oversight and payment of excess line premium taxes. The policies in question did not, in fact, extend ocean marine coverage, but rather extended coverage of the inland marine sort properly included within a jeweler's block policy. The insurance was not exclusively of the kind qualifying for the exemption set forth in N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 2117(b)(3). The penalty imposed in lieu of license revocation did not shock the judicial conscience and thus could not be disturbed.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the town notified DEC of two laws affecting plaintiff's proposed operations resulting in a series of claims and counterclaims by the parties. The appellate court held a reading of the 1988 law made plain that the town board, had it foreseen that a section would be declared unconstitutional, would have intended the enforcement of the nonoffending portion. There was no assertion that the company's representatives made specific inquiry regarding any statutes affecting the construction and/or operation of a landfill in the town or that they made any efforts to ascertain the existence of any laws or regulations with regard thereto. Therefore, the company could not assert estoppel.</SPAN></P>

The juror indicated that nothing about his experience prevented him from being fair and impartial, and thus defendant failed to show that the juror's state of mind was likely to preclude him from rendering an impartial verdict based upon the evidence. The appellate court held that expert testimony regarding abused child syndrome or similar conditions was properly admitted to explain behavior of a victim that might have appeared unusual or that jurors may not have understood. There was no requirement that lesser included offenses be available for every crime. Defendant failed to preserve for review his further contentions. The evidence, the law and the circumstances of the case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation, established that defendant received meaningful representation. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, the verdict was not contrary to the weight of the evidence, and the sentence was not unduly harsh or severe.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Consolidated appeals from the Supreme Court, Bronx County (New York), required the court to examine certain provisions of the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1980, specifically N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20. The lower court determined that it lacked jurisdiction and discharged respondent insanity acquittees without any inquiry as to their mental condition or need for further supervision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that a court had to conduct a hearing to determine whether there was good cause to extend the orders of conditions under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(1)(o), or whether the insanity acquittees meet the criteria for discharge pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(13). Both insanity acquitees' psychiatrists submitted affidavits setting forth sufficient allegations of potential danger to warrant hearings. The interests of public safety were not be ignored by allowing the insanity acquittees to be released, unsupervised into the community, without first determining whether they were in need of further observation to protect themselves and the public. Accordingly, the orders which dismissed applications to extend orders of conditions pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(12) were reversed, on the law, without costs, the applications granted, and the courts directed to conduct hearings to determine whether there was good cause to extend the orders of conditions or to determine whether the insanity acquittees meet the criteria for discharge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the lower courts, ordered the applications to extend orders of conditions granted, and the lower courts were directed to conduct hearings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mental Health - Person Acquitted of Crime by Reason of Insanity - Extension of Order of Conditions after Expiration Date </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The failure to hold a hearing before the expiration of an order of conditions imposed on an insanity acquittee under the supervision of the State Office of Mental Health pursuant to CPL 330.20 does not divest the convicting court of jurisdiction and require that acquittee be discharged. Nothing in the statute expressly precludes a court from addressing an extension of an order of conditions after its expiration date, particularly where, as here, &quot;good cause&quot; supports the application.  Rather, the statutory scheme requires that a court conduct a hearing to determine whether there is &quot;good cause&quot; to extend an order of conditions under CPL 330.20 (1) (o), or whether an insanity acquittee meets the criteria for discharge pursuant to CPL 330.20 (13).  Dismissing a petition to extend an order of conditions as untimely on jurisdictional grounds is improper.  The policy in favor of continued supervision of insanity acquittees prior to discharge, combined with a broader concern of protecting the general public from releasing potentially dangerously ill patients, unsupervised, necessitates disregarding a mere technical defect, and also warrants a broad view of the court's jurisdiction to extend an order of conditions.  The interests of public safety should not be ignored by allowing insanity acquittees to be released, unsupervised into the community, without first determining whether they are in need of further observation to protect themselves and the public.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent health center submitted to appellant department of health (DOH), an application for the construction of a nursing home. After the DOH notified the center that the application was subject to a moratorium, the center sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin the DOH from applying the moratorium to the application. The Supreme Court, Nassau County, New York, granted the center's motion from which the DOH appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the injunction on the ground that the moratorium was inapplicable to the center's project as it violated N.Y. Pub. Health Law art. 28. The appellate court held that the center did not make a prima facie showing that the DOH violated or threatened to violate any provision of N.Y. Pub. Health Law art. 28. Thus, the center did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits ad was not entitled to a preliminary injunction. Because of the uncertainty regarding anticipated demand for nursing home beds, the DOH properly exercised its discretion to delay a decision on the pending applications in order to study public need. The declaration of a moratorium was within the health commissioner's inherent discretionary power and was consistent with the proper exercise of a statutory duty only to authorize construction of necessary facilities. The moratorium was not a rule or change of practice, but was rather a temporary suspension of the processing of applications. There being no violation of N.Y. Pub. Health Law art. 28, the trial court should not have enjoined the DOH from discharging its responsibility pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2802.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - Nursing Homes - Validity of Temporary Moratorium on Processing Conditionally Approved Nursing Home Projects </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant Department of Health (DOH) acted within its statutory authority in determining that plaintiffs' conditionally approved application to construct a nursing home was subject to the DOH's statewide temporary moratorium on the processing of nursing home projects pending a review on the needs for nursing homes throughout the state.  Supreme Court erred in preliminarily enjoining the DOH from including plaintiffs' project in the moratorium and directing defendants to continue processing plaintiffs' application.  The DOH has a statutory duty to approve the establishment and construction of a nursing home only where it is convinced that there is a public need therefor (Public Health Law &sect; 2802; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see also</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&sect; 2801-a [3]).  Because of the uncertainty regarding anticipated demand for nursing home beds, the DOH properly exercised its discretion to delay a decision on the pending applications in order to study public need. The conditional and contingent approval of plaintiffs' project was not tantamount to final approval of the certificate of need application. Consequently, when the temporary moratorium was imposed, plaintiffs' application was pending and subject to the moratorium. Moreover, the temporary moratorium was not a rule or change of practice, but was rather a temporary suspension of the processing of applications.  A temporary suspension, imposed for a valid and reasonable purpose in keeping with the agencies' responsibilities under the statute, is within the authority of the DOH so long as its duration is confined to that reasonable period of time needed to review and revise the public need methodology.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from two judgments of the Supreme Court of Albany County (New York) that convicted defendant of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, and denied defendant's motion pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that he was entitled to have his conviction vacated on the basis that his defense counsel's failure to seek a determination that his arrest was not supported by reasonable cause to believe that he had committed a crime. Defendant also contended that his attorney failed to have his statement to the police suppressed as the product of an illegal arrest. The appellate court found that, from its review of this record, the appellate court could discern no legitimate strategic or tactical explanation for defense counsel's failure to seek a Dunaway hearing. Further, in the absence of some information known to the police that singled out defendant as the one who possessed the crack cocaine, his warrantless arrest lacked probable cause. Moreover, the only admissible testimony pertaining to defendant's statement found in the record pertained solely to statements made postarrest, and did not provide the necessary probable cause for defendant's arrest. Nor did the appellate court find that defendant's later oral statement admitting ownership of the crack cocaine excused the lack of probable cause for his arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant pleaded guilty to two counts each of murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. The Supreme Court, Monroe County, New York, sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without parole on each count of murder in the first degree, to run concurrent to consecutive terms of 25 years to life on each count of murder in the second degree. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that his pleas were invalid, as they was entered during the 120-day period provided for the prosecutor to elect to file a notice of intent to seek the death penalty pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 250.40(2). Defendant relied on the Matter of Hynes rule that a defendant could not plead guilty to first degree murder while a notice of intent was pending. The appellate court noted the qualification to that rule that plea bargaining to lesser offenses even when a notice of intent was pending, or to first degree murder in the absence of a notice of intent, was not affected by the rule. The plea agreement offered by the People to allow defendant to plead guilty in exchange for life in prison without parole was essentially an announcement of an intention not to seek the death penalty, such that his plea fell within the qualification to the rule and was valid. By pleading guilty, defendant waived his other contentions that his guilty pleas to first and second degree murder for the same offense violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy and that the trial court erred in allowing the district attorney unrestricted subpoena power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Plea of Guilty - Capital Murder - Validity of Plea Entered Prior to Expiration of 120-Day Period within Which People May Seek Death Penalty </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant validly entered a guilty plea to two counts each of murder in the first and second degrees (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1]; &sect; 125.25 [1]) prior to the expiration of the 120-day period within which the People could elect to seek the death penalty (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 250.40 [2]) where the People had not filed a notice of intent. While a defendant may not plead guilty to first degree murder while a notice to seek the death penalty is &quot;pending&quot; pursuant to the decision of the Court of Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Hynes v Tomei</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (92 NY2d 613, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">cert denied</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;527 US 1015), invalidating the plea provisions of CPL 220.10 (5) (e) and 220.30 (3) (b) (vii), the term &quot;pending&quot; cannot be interpreted to include the entire 120-day period, regardless of whether a notice of intent has in fact been filed.  Here, the plea agreement offered by the People, allowing defendant to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, was the functional equivalent of an announcement of an intention not to seek the death penalty. In the absence of a notice of intent, the plea bargaining at issue remains unaffected by the decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Hynes v Tomei.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, defendant's remaining claims regarding the prosecutor's unrestricted subpoena power and an alleged double jeopardy violation were effectively waived by his plea of guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Plea of Guilty </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a prosecution for first degree murder defendant specifically waived his contention that the court erred in allowing the District Attorney unrestricted subpoena power.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Former Jeopardy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a prosecution for first and second degree murder, defendant's comprehensive waiver of &quot;the right to appeal the conviction on all grounds&quot; encompasses his contention that the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy was violated because he pleaded guilty to first and second degree murder for the same offense.  In any event, the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy bars successive prosecutions or punishments for the same criminal offense, not the simultaneous prosecution of a crime and its lesser included offenses, and therefore is inapplicable to defendant's contention.  </SPAN></P>

Tax Law &sect; 727. On appeal, the corporation argued the current stipulated valuation violated N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 2, which prohibited tax assessment valuations in excess of full value. The appellate court noted that by executing the stipulation, the corporation waived any constitutional protection afforded under the New York Constitution. However, the appellate court determined, if it was to reach the merits of the corporation's constitutional arguments, it would find each to be lacking. The appellate court reasoned the statute had a rational basis, sought to address and remedy a circumstance detrimental to the public welfare, and sought to achieve a balance between the competing interests in the least restrictive manner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York's grandparent visitation statute ( Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72) is not facially invalid under the decision of the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Troxel v Granville</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (530 US 57, 147 L. Ed. 2d 49, 120 S. Ct. 2054). That decision held that a &quot;broad&quot; nonparental visitation statute was unconstitutional as applied because of the failure to accord any deference to a parent's decision regarding visitation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Troxel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not prohibit judicial intervention when a fit parent refuses visitation, but only requires that a court accord &quot;some special weight to the parent's own determination&quot; when applying a nonparental visitation statute.  New York's statute has been interpreted to accord deference to a parent's decision, even though the statute does not specifically require such deference. Consequently, Supreme Court, in dismissing petitioner grandfather's application to obtain visitation with his minor grandchildren, erred in concluding that Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72 is unconstitutional on its face and in dismissing the petition on that ground.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, Monroe County (New York), which granted defendant's motion to set aside the verdict convicting him of loitering in a public place for the purpose of gambling with cards, dice, or other gambling paraphernalia, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(2). The trial court had determined the law was unconstitutional because it was indistinguishable from N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(3), which was invalidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held the issue was whether N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(2) was reasonably related to the public good. The police had observed a group of several young men, including defendant, who were shooting dice for money in a residential driveway. The appellate court held that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(2) did not punish conduct anticipatory to constitutionally protected activity. Rather, it was enacted under the authority of the State's police power to prohibit loitering in a public place, not for the purpose of all gambling, but only for the purpose of gambling with cards, dice, or other gambling paraphernalia. That power was very broad and comprehensive and in its exercise the conduct of an individual and the use of property could be regulated so as to interfere, to some extent, with the freedom of the one and the enjoyment of the other. Thus, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(2) did not need to be invalidated merely because it regulated otherwise legal activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the County Court of Ulster County (New York) which convicted him upon his plea of guilty of the crime of murder in the first degree. Defendant also appealed, by permission, the order which denied his motion, pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10, to vacate the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that his guilty plea had to be vacated because the trial court failed to specifically advise him prior to accepting the plea that he would be relinquishing his rights under a cooperation agreement and abandoning his pretrial motions to dismiss the indictment and suppress evidence, and that his guilty plea was the result of ineffective assistance by trial counsel. The appellate court found the plea was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made and operated to extinguish any claims that defendant could have had under the cooperation agreement, as well as his rights to pursue his pretrial motions, despite the trial court's failure to explicitly address those specific consequences of the guilty plea. The appellate court also determined that considering the overwhelming evidence against defendant and the uncertainty of success on his pretrial motions, defendant received a favorable plea bargain. Therefore, under the totality of the circumstances viewed at the time of the representation, the appellate court concluded that defendant received meaningful representation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Plea of Guilty - Vacatur - People's Repudiation of &quot;Cooperation Agreement&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant is not entitled to vacatur of his guilty plea to murder in the first degree for having killed a seven-year-old girl with a blow to the head with a rock after sexually abusing her.  Defendant led law enforcement personnel to the girl's body in a wooded area buried under leaves and other debris after signing a written &quot;cooperation agreement,&quot; whereby he agreed to disclose information relative to the child's whereabouts in return for the People's promise not to charge him with murder. However, the People expressly repudiated the agreement and charged defendant with murder after an autopsy and forensic examination established that, contrary to defendant's assertion when he signed the agreement, the child had died instantly as a result of a massive blunt force injury to the head.  The record demonstrates that defendant's plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made, and operated to extinguish any claims that defendant may have had under the &quot;cooperation agreement,&quot; as well as his rights to pursue his pretrial motions, despite the court's failure to explicitly address those specific consequences of the guilty plea. By pleading guilty, defendant forfeited his right to appellate review of any nonjurisdictional defect in the proceedings. Furthermore, the People's use and subsequent repudiation of the &quot;cooperation agreement&quot; in an attempt to locate a missing child does not constitute fraudulent activity which would warrant vacatur of defendant's plea.  In any event, defendant's own material misrepresentation provides a basis for rescission.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Right to Counsel - Effective Representation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a criminal prosecution wherein defendant was convicted of first degree murder upon his plea of guilty after he led police to the body of his victim pursuant to a &quot;cooperation agreement,&quot; defendant's argument that his guilty plea was the result of ineffective assistance by trial counsel is rejected. Considering the overwhelming evidence against defendant and the uncertainty of success on his pretrial motions, defendant received a favorable plea bargain.  Moreover defendant expressly stated during his plea colloquy his satisfaction with the representation he had received.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Plea of Guilty </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In defendant's first degree murder prosecution wherein he pleaded guilty and received a sentence of life in prison without parole, his argument that his plea should be vacated because, subsequent to his plea, the Court of Appeals found the plea provisions of the death penalty statute to be unconstitutional (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Hynes v Tomei,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 92 NY2d 613), lacks merit.  The Court of Appeals has since expressly held that the infirmity of the plea provisions does not, in and of itself, render invalid an otherwise valid guilty plea (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Edwards,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 96 NY2d 445). Since defendant's plea was otherwise knowing, voluntary and intelligent, that case is dispositive.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Years earlier, the landlord's predecessor had entered into a lease with a province of the Society of Jesus to rent a large number of apartments for use by priests and seminarians. After the seminary closed, the local Jesuit community continued to lease a smaller number of apartments for use by priests. The landlord commenced a summary holdover proceeding to end the community's rent-controlled tenancy, arguing that under case law interpreting New York's rent stabilization laws, a corporate tenant was not entitled to a renewal rent-controlled lease unless the lease specified a particular occupant of a particular apartment. The reviewing court agreed with an intermediate court that the local community had satisfied this condition years earlier when it supplied a list of occupants.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Renewal Lease - Apartments Used by Members of Religious Organization as Primary Residences </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Respondent, a religious organization which rented apartments in petitioner's building for the residential use of its members, is entitled to rent-stabilized renewal leases for those apartments occupied by members identified as occupants in a 1989 stipulation which resulted in the execution of rent-stablized renewal leases for the specified apartments. A corporate tenant is entitled to a renewal lease under the Rent Stabilization Law so long as the lease specifies a particular individual as the occupant and no perpetual tenancy is possible.  The parties' stipulation wherein the landlord specifically recognized that the specified apartments were the primary residences of the occupants satisfies that requirement.  Since the stipulation identifies particular individuals as the occupants of specific apartments, no perpetual tenancy is possible.  However, the Appellate Term properly remanded for a determination as to which apartments are no longer occupied by the individuals designated pursuant to the 1989 stipulation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the testimony convincingly established that defendant, an inmate, threw a combination of urine and feces on a correction counselor, knowing she was a prison employee, with intent to harass her. Defendant was not entitled to a circumstantial evidence charge. It was not an abuse of discretion to permit defendant's legs to remain shackled during the trial. Defendant had previously been convicted of two or more felonies, and the trial court correctly concluded that defendant was a persistent felony offender. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant's history and character and the nature and circumstances of his criminal conduct indicated that extended incarceration and life-time supervision would best serve the public interest. The trial court afforded defendant ample opportunity to be heard, addressed defendant's individual history, and stated its reasons at length, emphasizing defendant's 20-year history of felonies, many of which involved violence, the planned nature of the present crime, which the court described as reprehensible and degrading, and the need to condemn and deter such conduct within prisons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Aggravated Harassment of Employee by Inmate - Weight of Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's conviction of aggravated harassment of an employee by an inmate ( Penal Law &sect; 240.32) for having sprayed a liquid combination of urine and feces at a correction counselor from his prison cell was not contrary to the weight of evidence and should therefore be affirmed. Although the counselor, who had cited defendant in a misbehavior report a week before the incident, did not actually observe defendant projecting the substance at her, she testified that seconds before the incident she saw a sheet hanging in defendant's cell move to the side and then heard squirting sounds emanating from the cell, which was immediately adjacent to her and which defendant alone occupied in 23-hour lock down.  Consequently, her testimony that the substance emanated from defendant's cell was neither incredible nor unworthy of belief.  Moreover, while a subsequent search of defendant's cell approximately 15 minutes after the attack failed to reveal the presence of any of the sprayed urine/fecal substance or the container, if any, used to expel the substance, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the delay in the search afforded defendant ample opportunity to clean up and dispose of any incriminating evidence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Evidence - Circumstantial Evidence Charge - Aggravated Harassment of Correction Employee by Prison Inmate </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant, a prison inmate, was not entitled to a circumstantial evidence charge in his prosecution for aggravated harassment of an employee by an inmate ( Penal Law &sect; 240.32) for having sprayed a liquid combination of urine and feces at a correction counselor from his prison cell, since there was direct evidence regarding defendant's sole presence in the cell from which the substance emanated. Although the counselor did not actually observe defendant projecting the substance at her, she testified that, seconds before the incident, she saw a sheet hanging in defendant's cell move to the side and then heard squirting sounds emanating from the cell, which was immediately adjacent to her and which defendant alone occupied in 23-hour lock down.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Trial - Proper Use of Leg Restraints </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In defendant's prosecution for aggravated harassment of an employee by an inmate ( Penal Law &sect; 240.32) for having sprayed a liquid combination of urine and feces at a correction counselor from his prison cell, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting defendant's legs to remain shackled during the trial.  The decision was expressly based on security concerns attributable to defendant's criminal history, his inmate disciplinary record and the nature of the crime charged.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Persistent Felony Offender - Aggravated Harassment of Correction Employee by Prison Inmate </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The imposition of a consecutive 15-year to life prison sentence under the persistent felony offender statute ( Penal Law &sect;&sect; 70.10, 70.25 [2-a]; CPL 400.20) upon defendant's conviction of the class E felony of aggravated harassment of an employee by an inmate ( Penal Law &sect; 240.32) for having sprayed a liquid combination of urine and feces at a correction counselor from his prison cell should not be set aside as being harsh and excessive. Defendant received the minimum authorized persistent felony offender sentence. The sentencing court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant's 20-year history of violent criminal conduct, his lengthy inmate disciplinary history, including assaults on prison staff, and the nature and circumstances of his criminal conduct warrant extended incarceration and life-time supervision under the persistent felony offender statute.  Furthermore, the sentencing court properly relied on the need to deter such conduct by prison inmates in imposing a lengthy A-1 felony sentence. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord commenced a holdover summary proceeding to evict respondent tenant for harboring a dog. The trial court dismissed the petition, and entered a final judgment of possession in favor of the tenant. The landlord appealed, and the Supreme Court, First Department (New York) reversed and granted a final judgment of possession in the landlord's favor. The tenant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' lease provided there were to be no pets. The tenant openly and notoriously harbored a pet for three months, with the actual knowledge of the servants and employees at the building, who were not required by the landlord to report the pet harboring. Under New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 27-2009.1, the failure to seek enforcement of a no-pet clause in a lease within three months resulted in the landlord's having waived that breach of the lease. In rejecting the landlord's argument that it did not have knowledge of the pet harboring, the highest court found that the three-month statute of limitations required routine awareness on the part of the landlord. The landlord would not be able to stop the running of the three-month period simply by closing its eyes and ears. In the instant case, the tenant routinely walked his dog three times a day, and everyone around saw it. The fact that the landlord's agents were not required to report it did not change the fact that their knowledge would be imputed to the landlord. The failure to commence the instant proceedings within three months was deemed to be a waiver of the no-pet provision of the lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's order was reversed, and the petition dismissed, with the final judgment of possession in favor of the tenant reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Harboring Animals in Leased Premises - Waiver of No-Pet Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a holdover summary proceeding, petitioner landlord waived its right to enforce a no-pet covenant in respondents' cooperative proprietary lease where respondents &quot;openly and notoriously&quot; harbored a pet for three months with the actual knowledge of building personnel, and petitioner failed to commence a summary proceeding within that three-month period as required by Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 27-2009.1 (b) in order to enforce the covenant.  The ordinance provides that where a &quot;tenant ... openly and notoriously for a period of three months ... harbors ... a household pet ... and the owner or his or her agent has knowledge of this fact, and such owner fails within this three month period to commence a summary proceeding or action to enforce a lease provision prohibiting the keeping of such household pets, such lease provision shall be deemed waived.&quot; The ordinance was intended to remedy the abuses arising from the infrequent, selective and dilatory enforcement of no-pet clauses, and is applicable to all existing leases, including cooperative proprietary leases, excluding only buildings owned and managed by the New York City Housing Authority.  Proof of &quot;openly and notoriously&quot; harboring the pet in the apartment for a period of three months or more raises a presumption of knowledge by the owner or the building's managing agent of this fact.  The word &quot;agent&quot; should be broadly construed to include the maintenance staff, porters and security guards at respondents' building who had actual knowledge that respondents were harboring a dog in their apartment. Furthermore, the ordinance requires that the actual knowledge of such on-site building personnel be imputed to the building's non-resident managing agent, even if such employees were not expressly required to report tenant harboring of pets. A landlord may not avoid having imputed knowledge of the tenant harboring a pet by turning a &quot;blind eye&quot; to such an open and notorious fact.  </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 145.10 after admittedly spraying a loathsome solution all over the front of the hall of the Court of Appeals of New York. The court reviewing his conviction held that the record clearly contradicted his claims that he was denied the right to counsel at arraignment and before the grand jury, because he explicitly waived those rights, and he was known to have extensive prior contacts with the justice system. There was also plenty of evidence that the damage he caused fell within the statute's prohibition. The hall stank for months, and enormous expenditures were required to eliminate the stench.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant employee was disqualified from receiving workers' compensation benefits. Thereafter, hearings were held to address the employee's activities subsequent to April 16, 1997, after which a workers' compensation law judge ruled that the employee was not fraudulently receiving benefits. Respondent New York Workers' Compensation Board reversed and disqualified the employee from further wage replacement, and the employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee asserted that N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law &sect; 114-a was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court disagreed. The statute provided that a person would be disqualified from receiving compensation where he or she obtained benefits by knowingly making a false statement or representation as to a material fact. To the extent that the employee contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to define the term &quot;material fact&quot;, the appellate court held there was no requirement that every term in a statute be precisely defined. Rather, a statute would pass constitutional muster so long as it provided persons of ordinary intellect reasonable notice of the proscribed conduct. The appellate court held the term in question could be understood by a person of ordinary intelligence and was thus not susceptible to arbitrary enforcement. Indeed, the challenged phrase had a common understanding and was used, without definition, in many other statutory schemes. As to an assertion that the statute was criminal in nature and that the substantial evidence standard of review could not apply, the appellate court had previously rejected such an assertion.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that it was not inclined to accede to the lessee's request to inquire into the county's motives for condemning the property. Instead, the appellate court found that the lessee made no argument that the underlying proceeding was unconstitutional, that the acquisition was made without the requisite authority, or that it was not for a legitimate public purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents contended that, in light of Troxel, &sect; 72 was unconstitutional on its face. The appeals court concluded that the specific manner in which the statute was applied by the trial court did not violate the parents' fundamental right under the Due Process Clause to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. The instant case differed significantly from Troxel. Unlike the trial court in Troxel, the instant trial court did not presume that the grandmother's request for visitation would be granted in the absence of a showing that the children would be adversely impacted. Instead, by requiring the grandmother to establish standing, the court gave the parents' decision some presumptive or &quot;special&quot; weight, which is all Troxel required. The instant court further concluded that the record supported the trial court's determination that visitation was in the best interests of the children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72, which authorizes a grandparent to petition for visitation rights where &quot;either or both ... parents ... is or are deceased, or where circumstances show that conditions exist which equity would see fit to intervene,&quot; is not unconstitutional on its face under the holding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Troxel v Granville</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (530 US 57) in which a state statute authorizing &quot;any person&quot; to &quot;petition the court for visitation rights at any time&quot; was declared unconstitutional as infringing upon the fundamental due process rights of parents to rear their children.  In contrast to the statute declared unconstitutional in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Troxel,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72 is narrowly limited to grandparents and does not grant automatic standing.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Family Court's application of Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72 to grant petitioner maternal grandmother visitation rights to her five minor grandchildren over the objection of respondent parents is not violative of respondents' due process rights under the holding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Troxel v Granville</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (530 US 57) in which a state statute authorizing &quot;any person&quot; to &quot;petition the court for visitation rights at any time&quot; was declared unconstitutional as infringing upon the fundamental due process rights of parents to rear their children.  The specific manner in which Domestic Relations Law &sect; 72 was applied here does not violate the fundamental right of respondents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.  Family Court, in determining that petitioner had standing to petition for visitation, considered the fact that respondents' objection was primarily based upon a child abuse report by petitioner which resulted in an &quot;indicated&quot; finding of abuse.  The court further considered the children's close and loving relationship with petitioner, and considered the best interests of the children only after determining that petitioner had standing to contest respondents' decision. The court did not presume that petitioner's request for visitation would be granted in the absence of a showing that the children would be adversely impacted. Instead, by requiring petitioner to establish standing, the court gave respondents' decision the &quot;special&quot; weight required by due process. Lastly, the court, after fully considering the nature and basis of respondents' objections, crafted a visitation order addressing those concerns, directing the parties not to make disparaging remarks about each other in the children's presence.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A TA included a building intended, designed, and used as a private residence where overnight accommodations were rented from time to time to guests. Because the apartment house was occupied on a temporary basis by persons with out-of-state vehicle licenses, the owner was found in violation of the ordinance, as he had no special permit to operate a TA. The trial court declared the TA provisions invalid, as a word was missing from the definition. Appellants argued that the trial court erred in concluding that the definition was facially defective. The appellate division found that the trial court correctly concluded that the owner was improperly found in violation of the TA provision, as there was no evidence that he rented rooms in his private residence and the ZBA's conclusion that the transient rentals were sufficient to render the apartment house a tourist accommodation lacked a rational basis given the absence of such a restriction in the ordinance. Because the ZBA's ruling that the TA provisions applied to the owner was irrational, there was no need for the trial court to declare the provisions facially invalid and the judgment had to be modified to that extent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his robbery conviction in Monroe County Court (New York), arguing counsel ineffectiveness, prosecutorial misconduct, and failure to provide him with notice, pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A convenience store clerk viewed a surveillance videotape, and still photographs derived from it, shortly after a robbery. Defendant was not identified and arrested until some time afterward. An appeals court reviewing his robbery conviction held that the only issue preserved for review was whether the prosecution was entitled to rely on the clerk's in-court identification of defendant, since it had not notified the defense pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 710.30 of the earlier viewings by the clerk. The appeals court indicated that defendant mistook the purpose of the statutory provision, which was to prevent unduly suggestive identification procedures orchestrated by police. When the clerk viewed the videotape and the stills, there was no proposed identification at all; she was simply helping police determine which photographs depicted the robbers.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant, convicted of robbery in the first degree arising out of his forcible theft of cash from a convenience store clerk, is not entitled to suppression or preclusion of identification evidence in connection with the clerk's viewings of the store surveillance video and photographs depicting defendant's commission of the robbery. The store clerk initially viewed the store security videotape at the police station within a short time after the robbery and pointed out the robbers. The clerk's subsequent viewing of composite stills from the surveillance video showing the crime as it occurred was not unduly suggestive, and thus did not impermissibly taint the subsequent lineup and in-court identification. The clerk's viewing of the surveillance photos, without any overt or tacit attempts by police to link the photographs to a particular suspect or known individual, did not constitute a police-arranged identification procedure. At the time of the viewing, defendant was not an identified suspect, but a perpetrator of unknown identity.  The police showed the clerk the stills in order to ascertain for themselves which of the individuals entering the store had committed the robbery. Consequently, the viewing was not an identification procedure, but rather an investigatory measure designed to allow the clerk to report the crime.  Moreover, even assuming that the procedure utilized by the police was an identification procedure, it was not &quot;unnecessarily suggestive.&quot; There is no constitutional infirmity in showing a crime victim or other eyewitness photographs of the crime itself.  No due process concerns of fairness are raised by a procedure that enhances the eyewitness's memory of the crime and hence the accuracy and reliability of the eyewitness's identification. In any event, the viewing in this case created absolutely no risk of misidentification by the clerk, because the surveillance photographs depict the perpetrators in the act.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disclosure - Notice of Intention to Offer Evidence - Store Clerk's Viewing of Surveillance Video of Robbery </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In defendant's robbery prosecution, arising out of his forcible theft of cash from a convenience store clerk, the People were not required to give defendant notice of their intention to offer identification evidence pursuant to CPL 710.30 regarding the clerk's viewings of the store surveillance video on the night of the robbery. Such a viewing did not constitute a police-arranged identification procedure that required the statutory notice. The police had no suspects and did not ask the clerk to identify any particular suspect or known individual as the robber. Instead, the police merely asked the clerk who among the persons in the store that night had committed the robbery. They further sought to confirm that the surveillance video was an accurate depiction of the robbery and robbers. The clerk then identified the perpetrators, but did not identify defendant &quot;as such.&quot; Neither the clerk's viewing of the surveillance video nor anything said to or by the clerk during that viewing was at all probative of defendant's guilt or innocence.  Moreover, to point out an unknown criminal actor on videotape is akin to giving a description of the appearance of that individual at the time of the crime.  Such observations or descriptions are not within the ambit of CPL 710.30.  Under the circumstances, the clerk's viewing of the surveillance video had no potential for suggestiveness, and it is thus not the kind of police-orchestrated identification procedure of which a defendant is entitled to notice. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer argued the school construction authority exceeded its statutory authority, violated its due process rights, and violated the Contract Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, when it decided to condemn the developer's leasehold property for use as a public school. The developer argued its leasehold interest was a prior public interest that should be protected. The court found that although lands already acquired for public use should not be taken for another public use unless there were special, unusual, and peculiar reasons, construction of a public school was such a reason, within the contemplation of the New York City School Construction Act, N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1725 et seq. The developer contended it had already partially installed a drainage system and had vested rights in the property. The court found the developer would be justly compensated for the condemnation of its interest, and that powers essential to the operation of government could not be contracted away and were not subject to the Contract Clause. The school construction authority was a public benefit corporation and construction of a school was an essential governmental operation.</SPAN></P>

Property acquired by the City of New York for public use in connection with a commercial urban development project and then leased to petitioner as a redeveloper under an approved urban renewal plan can thereafter be lawfully condemned by respondent New York City School Construction Authority for construction of a public school. The proposed acquisition does not exceed respondent's broad authority to acquire property by condemnation for school construction ( Public Authorities Law &sect; 1728 [6]).

Petitioner's status as a lessee does not afford it any constitutional protection against the condemnation of its interest in the subject property.  To the extent article XVIII, &sect; 1 of the New York State Constitution encompasses a commercial project, it does not go so far as to confer any protected status on the redeveloper. The provision for incidental or appurtenant facilities is sufficiently broad to include a neighborhood school within the scope of an urban renewal project.  </SPAN></P>

Condemnation by respondent authority will not result in an unconstitutional impairment of petitioner's lease with the City in violation of the Contract Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 10).  The condemnor is a public benefit corporation created by the Legislature and is an independent agency of the State, not the City.  Moreover, respondent has conceded that the exercise of the power of eminent domain is subject to the obligation to pay just compensation to the condemnee, and the value of a lease may be determined by economic factors.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union, negotiating on behalf of city police, and the city were negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Chapter 641 of the Laws of 1998, which amended the Taylor Law (Civil Service Law &sect; 212 [3]) so as to vest the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) with exclusive jurisdiction to resolve scope of bargaining disputes arising in the course of collective negotiations between a municipality and its police and fire departments, is not unconstitutional as violative of the home rule provision of the State Constitution (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [b] [2]).  The statute uniformly prohibits every local government from preventing its police and fire unions from utilizing PERB.  The fact that the additional provision permitting a public employee union to opt to continue dispute resolutions procedures before an existing local body applies to only four localities in the State does not render the statute a special law. The procedures of the local bodies are the substantial equivalent of the corresponding procedures of PERB, and the option of determining which administrative body has exclusive jurisdiction rests with the public employee organization.  Moreover, even if chapter 641 is a special law, it falls within the exception to the home rule procedural requirements, since it serves a substantial State concern.  The State clearly has a substantial interest in the speedy resolution of labor disputes between its municipalities and their police and fire departments. </SPAN></P>

Permitting a public employee union to opt to use PERB does not amend or repeal the legislation which created the local bodies.  The statute simply prevents a municipality with its own board from requiring its police or firefighter unions to use that board, rather than choosing to use PERB.  It is not a delegation of any legislative authority, nor does it delegate to the public employee organizations the authority to resolve bargaining impasses or any other governmental function.  </SPAN></P>

Consequently, pursuant to the statute, PERB has exclusive jurisdiction over any impasse which may arise during collective negotiations between the City of New York and its police force. PERB's exclusive jurisdiction over impasse and negotiation issues (Civil Service Law &sect; 209) must necessarily include scope of bargaining issues.  Furthermore, since scope of bargaining issues do not generally arise in improper practice proceedings within the meaning of Civil Service Law &sect; 209-a, the jurisdiction of the City's Board of Collective Bargaining, where the available option has been exercised in favor of PERB, is limited to jurisdiction over improper practice disputes under Civil Service Law &sect; 205 (5) (d).  Accepting the City's contention that PERB's impasse authority does not include scope of bargaining issues would create the &quot;absurdity&quot; of having two separate agencies on two different levels of government attempting to separately resolve the intertwined issues of scope of bargaining and impasse resolution.  </SPAN></P>

Defendants argued on appeal that the religious exemption was not applicable to private or parochial schools and that &sect; 2164(9) did not allow plaintiffs an action to enforce exemption rights. The appellate court held that (1) the exemption applied to private and parochial schools; (2) plaintiffs could assert their cause of action under the statute despite the fact the statute did not specifically authorize such an action; and (3) the trial court properly granted the preliminary injunction because plaintiffs established a likelihood of success on the merits given that defendants denied the exemption using a criterion that was no longer in the statute and because the loss of First Amendment freedoms could show irreparable injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants towing companies appealed the Albany County Supreme Court's (New York) grant of respondent tax commissioner's motion to dismiss, claiming that N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tax commissioner created tax on vessels engaged in petroleum business based on gallons of fuel sold or consumed. Towing companies challenged the tax because it applied to fuel in the vessels' engines used solely during their intrastate movement. Trial court granted tax commissioner's motion to dismiss because towing companies failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. On appeal the appellate court held that the tax was facially unconstitutional because it violated the Commerce Clause. Towing companies were being taxed on fuel purchased outside the state, used solely in the vessel's engines, and never removed from the flow of interstate commerce, or coming to rest in the state. The tax had no substantial nexus with the state. As a result, towing companies did not have to exhaust their administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies - Challenge to Petroleum Business Tax - Facial Unconstitutionality&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Petitioners need not exhaust administrative remedies before challenging, as violative of the Commerce Clause, that portion of New York's Petroleum Business Tax, which deems vessels which merely enter New York waters, propelled by petroleum in their fuel tanks, to be a &quot;petroleum business&quot; within the State sufficient to establish the requisite nexus for the purpose of taxation even though the fuel consumed during such interstate voyage never comes to rest in the State (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 301-a).  While a party seeking judicial review of a tax determination must ordinarily first exhaust administrative remedies, where, as here, the taxing statute is challenged as facially unconstitutional, a basis which is not fact dependent, the development of a factual record at the administrative level serves no purpose and thus constitutes an exception to the exhaustion requirement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Motor Fuel Taxes - Constitutionality of Petroleum Business Tax - Commerce Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. That portion of New York's Petroleum Business Tax (PBT), which deems vessels which merely enter New York waters, propelled by petroleum in their fuel tanks, to be a &quot;petroleum business&quot; within the State sufficient to establish the requisite nexus for the purpose of taxation even though the fuel consumed during such interstate voyage never comes to rest in the State (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 301-a), is facially unconstitutional as violative of the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8, cl [3]).  Under established Commerce Clause jurisprudence, a substantial nexus with a taxing state must exist before a tax may be imposed on an activity or business.  The PBT artificially imposes such nexus by taxing petitioners for being engaged in a &quot;petroleum business&quot; on fuel purchased outside of New York which is brought into New York in their vessels' engines and consumed through their intrastate movings while in New York, without having been removed from the stream of interstate commerce. Consequently, the PBT is an unauthorized exercise of the State's power over an instrumentality of interstate commerce. Moreover, since there is no set of circumstances under which the challenged portions of the PBT would be valid, no savings analysis need be employed.  </SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that under the agreement, the insurance deductible amount was properly passed through by project contractor to public benefit corporation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent school's application to be a charter school was approved by respondent state university, and deemed approved by respondent state regents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proceeding was a combined appeal of the judgment and the determinations of respondent trustees and regents.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - Board of Education - Capacity to Challenge Administrative Determination Approving Charter School Application </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Petitioner Board of Education has the legal capacity to maintain a CPLR article 78 proceeding to challenge as arbitrary and capricious the administrative determination of the State University of New York Trustees approving the operation of a charter school within the boundaries of the school district. The right of a board of education of a school district to commence a CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging an administrative determination to approve a charter school application and issue a charter within a school district's boundaries (Education Law &sect; 2851 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) can be inferred as part of the school board's duty and responsibility to provide a system of public education to all children within its district (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Education Law &sect;&sect; 1709, 3202), particularly where, as here, a school board claims that its ability to provide education to all students within its district's boundaries is jeopardized by the determination, and the charter entity allegedly gave insufficient consideration to the issue of economic impact on the school district. Absent a clear legislative intent to negate judicial review, a school district or school board should not be prohibited from seeking review of the determination to grant an application and issue a charter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - Board of Education - Capacity to Challenge Constitutionality of Charter Schools Act </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Although petitioner Board of Education has the legal capacity to maintain a CPLR article 78 proceeding to challenge as arbitrary and capricious the administrative determination of the State University of New York Trustees approving the operation of a charter school within the boundaries of the school district, the Board lacks the capacity to sue to invalidate the charter school statutory scheme (Education Law &sect; 2851 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) on constitutional grounds.  Petitioner has not demonstrated that the Charter Schools Act affects any proprietary interest in a specific sum of money as to allow it to mount a constitutional challenge to invalidate the statutory scheme. Even though the Charter Schools Act contemplates that the State will initially fund money to the school district which, in turn, will distribute it to the subject charter school depending on the number of students enrolled in that school (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Education Law &sect; 2856 [1]), there is nothing in this funding mechanism which creates a proprietary interest in the school district to a specific sum of money where none otherwise existed.  Rather, the funding follows the child and if the child does not attend one of its public schools, the school district has no right to the funds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Necessary Parties - Dismissal of Board of Regents as Party Respondent in Proceeding Challenging Approval of Charter School Application </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Supreme Court properly dismissed the Board of Regents as a party respondent in petitioner Board of Education's CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging the administrative determination of the State University of New York (SUNY) Trustees approving the operation of a charter school within the boundaries of the school district pursuant to the Charter Schools Act (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Education Law &sect; 2851 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">).  Although the Board of Regents is designated as the &quot;only&quot; body authorized to issue a charter, in actuality the Board of Regents is powerless under the Charter Schools Act to reject or to veto a proposed charter submitted to it by the SUNY Trustees.  Once a proposed charter is entered into between an applicant and the SUNY Trustees, the issuance of the charter itself is a fait accompli even where, as here, the Board of Regents may initially disapprove of some aspects of the application.  Furthermore, no factual allegation or showing has been made that the Board of Regents played a substantial role in the injury to petitioners or that the Board of Regents was primarily responsible for the determination to approve the subject application or issue the charter. Moreover, notwithstanding its role in the process, there has not been a sufficient showing that the Board of Regents' participation is necessary for a complete resolution of the matter or that it will be inequitably affected by any possible resolution (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 1001).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, neighbors and environmental activists, sought review of a determination of respondent New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment in the Hudson Valley, arguing inadequacy of compliance with N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law art. X.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law art. X required respondent agency to perform a comprehensive review before certifying any site as appropriate for a new electricity generating facility. When respondent certified a site in a scenic area of the Hudson Valley, petitioners challenged the review's compliance with the statute. The court found substantial evidence in the record supporting each of respondent's determinations that statutory requirements had been met, particularly that appropriate procurement standards had been used and that waiver of local zoning laws was appropriate. Because the utility lacked eminent domain powers, respondent could not have required it to consider all alternative sites, but there was plenty of evidence that respondent took care to determine that the siting decision would not affect the view from a nearby historic site, the estate of the painter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal - Preservation of Issue for Review - Siting of Major Electric Generating Facility - Exception Taken to Administrative Decision </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a proceeding challenging the determination of respondent New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment under Public Service Law article X issuing a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to allow construction of a major electric generating facility on industrially zoned land located along the banks of the Hudson River, those claims that were not effectively raised by petitioners in the administrative forum have not been preserved for appellate review.  Public Service Law &sect; 170 (1), which establishes an application for rehearing as a prerequisite for judicial review, does not automatically make every issue raised in the petition for rehearing subject to appellate review.  There is still the regulatory requirement that a party take exception to the recommended decision as a prerequisite to raising arguments in a petition for rehearing (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;16 NYCRR 4.10 [d] [2]).  </SPAN></P>

In a proceeding challenging the determination of respondent New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment under Public Service Law article X issuing a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to allow construction of a major electric generating facility on industrially zoned land located along the banks of the Hudson River, the Siting Board's waiver of certain &quot;unreasonably restrictive&quot; requirements of the Town zoning ordinance pursuant to Public Service Law &sect; 168 (2) (d) did not violate the home rule provisions of the State Constitution (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [b] [2]), which empower the Legislature to enact general laws &quot;affecting the property, affairs or government of any local government.&quot; A statute qualifies as a &quot;general law&quot; if it in terms and in effect applies alike to all localities.  The comprehensive regulatory scheme relating to the siting of public utilities qualifies as a &quot;general law&quot; preempting local zoning ordinances whether or not a particular new power facility fulfills a State-wide interest.  Furthermore, the phrase &quot;unreasonably restrictive&quot; contained in Public Service Law &sect; 168 (2) (d) is not unconstitutionally vague when read with the qualifying language of the statute regarding &quot;the existing technology or the needs of or costs to ratepayers.&quot; As so qualified, the statutory language provides a sufficient objective standard for making a determination as to whether a local ordinance is &quot;unduly restrictive.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a proceeding challenging the determination of respondent New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment under Public Service Law article X issuing a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to allow construction of a major electric generating facility on industrially zoned land located along the banks of the Hudson River, the Siting Board had a rational basis for determining that the facility was selected pursuant to an &quot;approved procurement process&quot; (Public Service Law &sect; 160 [7]; &sect; 168 [2] [a] [i], [ii]).  Pursuant to its statutory authority (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Service Law &sect; 66-i), the Department of Public Service issued rulings declaring that competition in the electricity supply market is an &quot;approved procurement process&quot; consistent with the State Energy Plan in effect at the time of the current application.  Petitioners' belated attack on those rulings lacks merit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Siting of Major Electric Generating Facility - Evaluation of Alternative Locations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a proceeding challenging the determination of respondent New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment under Public Service Law article X issuing a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to allow construction of a major electric generating facility on industrially zoned land located along the banks of the Hudson River, the Siting Board properly determined that the applicant was not required to describe and evaluate alternative sites pursuant to Public Service Law &sect; 164 (1) (b).  The Siting Board rationally determined that a private applicant, lacking the power of eminent domain, cannot be required to present alternative sites that it neither owns nor has an option to purchase (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;16 NYCRR 1001.2 [d] [2]).  Further, although the Siting Board permitted petitioner to offer evidence of alternative sites on the issue of whether the plant is in the public interest, the record supports the Board's conclusion that the alternatives offered by petitioner had problems of their own and that there was &quot;no showing that there is an available, preferable site that should be developed&quot; instead of the proposed site. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Siting of Major Electric Generating Facility - Visual Impact of Proposed Facility </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In a proceeding challenging the determination of respondent New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment under Public Service Law article X issuing a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to allow construction of a major electric generating facility on industrially zoned land located along the banks of the Hudson River, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Siting Board's conclusion that, considering the environmental impacts, the construction and operation of the facility is in the public interest (Public Service Law &sect; 168 [2] [e]).  The record does not support petitioner's contention that construction of the facility will unreasonably impact renowned views of the Hudson River Valley.  The visual impact study commissioned by the applicant resulted in the reduction of the height of the plant's three emission stacks to 180 feet, a height that eliminates the need for obtrusive aviation warning lights and substantially reduces the degree to which the facility could be seen from distant points.  In addition, the ultimate decision to utilize dry cooling technology not only minimized impacts on the Hudson River but provided the further benefit of essentially eliminating visible stack plumes, a very significant mitigation measure in light of the focus groups' conclusion that stack plumes represented the most significant visual impact of the facility.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Siting of Major Electric Generating Facility - Lower Electricity Prices </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In a proceeding challenging the determination of respondent New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment under Public Service Law article X issuing a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to allow construction of a major electric generating facility on industrially zoned land located along the banks of the Hudson River, the record supports the Siting Board's determination that the plant would contribute to competition, thereby lowering electricity prices, displace less efficient plants, provide a reliable source of electricity at a time when there are projected energy shortfalls and relieve transmission constraints.  Evidence also established that, as a modern natural gas fueled facility, certain noxious gas levels would be reduced and the use of dry cooling technology would result in fewer fish kills because production will be displaced from other Hudson River power plants that draw more water and, therefore, kill more fish.  Further, the record indicates that the plant was required as a condition of approval to submit to the New York Independent System Operation (NYISO) for the dispatch of electricity. Therefore, even if the plant's electricity were to be sold outside the State, transmission of the electricity through NYISO would commit generators to minimize costs and maintain reliability and the overall amount of electricity produced in the State would be increased, thereby resulting in lower electricity prices.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from an incident in which defendant threw his urine on a correction officer. When the defendant was not a juvenile, an element of the crime of aggravated harassment of an employee by an inmate was that, at the time of the commission of the prohibited conduct, the defendant had to be an inmate as that term was defined in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.32. Defendant argued that the statute violated the ex post facto prohibition because defendant achieved the necessary inmate status prior to the effective date of the statute. Thus, he argued that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.32 was unconstitutional, as applied to him, because it rendered his conduct criminal based on an event, his incarceration, which predated the statute's enactment. The appellate court held defendant did not commit the crime of aggravated harassment of an employee until he engaged in the prohibited conduct in February 1998, well after N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.32 was enacted. The appellate court held defendant clearly had fair warning that his throwing of urine would result in criminal liability. Defendant's preexisting condition or status as an inmate did not result in an ex post facto violation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's claim that the trial court improperly precluded him from introducing the very statements he sought to have suppressed was unavailing, since the prosecution never offered to introduce the inculpatory portions of those statements, and the exculpatory portions of the statements did not qualify as declarations against penal interest. Defendant's claim of unconstitutional delay in prosecution was unpreserved. The trial court properly denied, as untimely, defendant's request to dismiss certain counts of the indictment on statute of limitations grounds. Since the trial court submitted the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree to the jury, which never reached that charge, defendant's claim that the trial court should have also submitted the more remote charge of manslaughter in the second degree was foreclosed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Husband and wife signed a prenuptial agreement in 1969. Under that agreement, which wife signed without the benefit of counsel, wife waived all present and future rights in real, personal, or mixed property husband owned at the time of marriage or would acquire in the future. At the time the agreement was signed, New York law gave a wife no rights in or to her husband's property, other than the right to spousal support, but also prohibited a wife from waiving her right to support. The law was changed after husband and wife were married and the change permitted courts to divide the marital estate. The appellate court held that husband and wife's prenuptial agreement was void on its face because it attempted to relieve husband of his obligation to provide spousal support, and that the six-year statute of limitations that applied to prenuptial agreements was tolled during the period of the parties' marriage.

Respondents also challenged the lower court's finding that demotion of petitioner from detective to uniform officer was a demotion. The appellate court found Civil Service Law &sect; 58(4)(c)(iv) retroactively applied to those individuals who were designated detectives during the period between the passage of N.Y. Civ. Serv.

The appellate court found after reassignment to a uniform officer, the officer would be compensated at a lower rate of pay. Thus, respondents' reassignment of petitioner constituted a demotion.

Laws chs. 5, 124, were legally enforceable debts of the state, thus making both statutes violative of N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11, which prohibited the contracting of state debts without a public referendum. The appellate court affirmed the order, determining that even when scrutinizing 1998 N.Y. Laws chs. 5, 124, in light of the mandates of N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 16, the appellate court found that those laws created no debt on behalf of the state which may ripen into an enforceable right against the state on the part of any bondholder. Accordingly, the appellate court concluded that their enactment did not violate that constitutional provision or any of the debt-limiting provisions of the New York Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, defendant appealed the judgment and order of the Supreme Court, Otsego County (New York), which convicted him upon his plea of guilty of murder in the first degree and denied his N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10 motion to vacate the judgment of conviction. The court granted permission to appeal the order denying the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to first-degree murder for killing his parents a month before he was to turn 19 years old. He appealed the conviction. He also challenged the denial of his motion under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10 to vacate the conviction. The appellate court affirmed, finding that the trial court had the statutory authority to sentence defendant to life imprisonment without parole. Defendant had concluded his first 18 years of life on his 18th birthday for purposes of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27. Defendant's reliance on U.S. Const. amend. VIII was misplaced because at the guilt phase of the trial he had not yet been convicted, and thus was not exposed to, a death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment and order were affirmed. The plea of guilty was not the result of a mistake of law and the integrity of the grand jury process had not been impaired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Validity of Plea under Death Penalty Statute and Imposition of Life Sentence without Parole </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's counseled plea of guilty to one count of murder in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [viii]) in satisfaction of all charges arising from the shooting deaths of his parents, and his sentence to life imprisonment without parole, are lawful and should not be vacated on direct appeal or on defendant's motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 where the prosecutor did not file a notice of intent to seek the death penalty. Under these circumstances, the capital plea provisions invalidated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Hynes v Tomei</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (92 NY2d 613, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">cert denied</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;527 US 1015) during the pendency of a death penalty notice (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 220.10 [5] [e]; 220.30 [3] [b] [vii]) are not implicated.  Rather, Supreme Court had the statutory authority to sentence defendant to life imprisonment without parole pursuant to CPL 400.27, which, in addition to setting forth the procedure for a separate proceeding for the jury to consider the death penalty where a defendant was convicted by a jury and the prosecution had timely filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, specifically provides that &quot;[n]othing in this section shall be deemed to preclude the people at any time from determining that the death penalty shall not be sought in a particular case, in which case the separate sentencing proceeding shall not be conducted and the court may sentence such defendant to life imprisonment without parole&quot; (CPL 400.27 [1]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Death Penalty - &quot;Same Criminal Transaction&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant's counseled plea of guilty to one count of murder in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [viii]) in satisfaction of all charges arising from the shooting deaths of his parents, and his sentence to life imprisonment without parole, are lawful and should not be vacated on direct appeal or on defendant's motion pursuant to CPL 440.10.  The Legislature's failure to define &quot;same criminal transaction&quot; as an aggravating factor does not render Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (viii)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague. Rather, the statute unambiguously proscribes multiple killings, which is specific conduct easily avoided by the innocent minded.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - First Degree Murder - 18-Year Age Requirement </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant's counseled plea of guilty to one count of murder in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [viii]) in satisfaction of all charges arising from the shooting death of his parents, and his sentence to life imprisonment without parole, are lawful and should not be vacated on direct appeal or on defendant's motion pursuant to CPL 440.10.  Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (b) is not unconstitutional due to its failure to define the phrase &quot;more than eighteen years old,&quot; an express prerequisite to prosecution for first degree murder. An individual concludes the &quot;first eighteen years of life&quot; on his or her eighteenth birthday and begins the &quot;nineteenth year of life&quot; on that day.  Consequently, the statutory phrase &quot;more than eighteen years old&quot; includes persons such as defendant, who was 18 years and 11 months old at the time of the events charged in the indictment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Defective Proceeding - Integrity of Grand Jury Impaired by Actions of District Attorney </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Defendant's counseled plea of guilty to one count of murder in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [viii]) in satisfaction of all charges arising from the shooting deaths of his parents, and his sentence to life imprisonment without parole, are lawful and should not be vacated on direct appeal or on defendant's motion pursuant to CPL 440.10.  The integrity of the Grand Jury process was not impaired and defendant suffered no prejudice from the prosecutor's exclusion of certain evidence.  The evidence defendant sought to have presented was of the type tending only to mitigate his liability rather than absolve him entirely of guilt for the crimes.  Furthermore, the prosecutor properly relayed the language of the statute verbatim.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Death Penalty - Heightened Due Process Analysis </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Defendant's counseled plea of guilty to one count of murder in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [viii]) in satisfaction of all charges arising from the shooting deaths of his parents, and his sentence to life imprisonment without parole, are lawful and should not be vacated on direct appeal or on defendant's motion pursuant to CPL 440.10.  Defendant was not entitled to a heightened due process analysis during the guilt phase of his trial, since heightened scrutiny is required only in the penalty phase of a capital prosecution.  Defendant's reliance on the 8th Amendment lacks merit, since, where a capital defendant has not yet been convicted, and thus is not exposed to a death sentence, the defendant is entitled to only &quot;standard 14th Amendment due process&quot; rather than review under the 8th Amendment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the ruling of the Supreme Court of Albany County (New York) dismissing appellants' complaint alleging the unconstitutionality of 1985 N.Y.

Law &sect;123-b(1), Warren County, N.Y., Budget Resolution No. 367 of 1998 and certain other 1998 resolutions of the Boards of Supervisors of appellee counties.</SPAN></P>

Appellee state defendants moved to dismiss the most recent complaint on the grounds of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and laches. The trial court dismissed appellants' complaint &quot;in all respects&quot; on the basis of res judicata and laches. Appellants sought review. Appellants' constitutional challenge to 1985 N.Y. Laws ch. 682, N.Y. State Fin. Law &sect;123-b(1), and appellee counties' financing and management contracts pursuant to ch. 682, should have been, and, to some extent, was previously litigated. As a result, their relitigation, even under different legal theories, was barred by res judicata and was also barred by laches.

The claims were claims for conspiracy to violate civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. All intentional tort claims were dismissed by the trial court. A claim for conspiracy to violate civil rights required a detailed fact pleading. A complaint containing only general allegations of a conspiracy to deprive a person of constitutional rights could not withstand a dismissal motion. Plaintiffs failed to substantiate their causes of action with detailed factual information concerning the alleged conspiracy, thus summary judgment dismissing the claims should have been granted. The evidence raised a question of fact as to whether the police acted with probable cause in arresting one of the plaintiffs and whether they were entitled to qualified immunity. Thus, summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs' additional &sect;1983 claims for deprivation of constitutional rights under color of law was precluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with raping a patient, sexually abusing and verbally harassing co-workers, and giving false information on applications for employment. After a hearing, respondent did not sustain the charge of rape of a patient or sexual harassment of one employee, but sustained the other charges, although it found that the false information charge did not warrant a finding of moral unfitness. Petitioner's license to practice medicine was revoked and he appealed. There was a rational basis for respondent's decision that misconduct regarding a co-worker occurred in the practice of medicine, since it happened during working hours. Sexual misconduct with a co-worker constituted moral unfitness to practice medicine within the meaning of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2530(20). Section 2530(20) gave fair notice to a person of ordinary intellect of the nature of proscribed conduct, so it was not unconstitutionally vague. Respondent was under no obligation to accept petitioner's excuses for perpetrating fraud. Revocation of petitioner's license was so incommensurate with the offense as to shock one's sense of fairness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent's finding petitioner engaged in professional misconduct in the practice of medicine was affirmed because petitioner engaged in sexual misconduct with a co-worker during working hours, and the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, but revocation of petitioner's license was disproportionate with his misconduct as it did not impact patient care or relate to his skill as a physician.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent tenant appealed Tompkins County Court (New York) affirmance of respondent's eviction by petitioner landlord, arguing that Ithaca, New York, Municipal Code ch. 177, &sect;&sect; 2, 3, authorizing eviction for illegal drug possession, was preempted by the N.Y. Real Prop. and Real Prop. Acts. Laws and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was evicted from his apartment by petitioner landlord pursuant to Ithaca, New York, Municipal Code ch. 177 &sect;&sect; 2, 3, which provided for summary eviction of tenants who had possessed or used illegal drugs on the premises. Respondent argued that New York state legislation had preempted the area. N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect;231(1) provided generally for evictions for illegal use, and other statutes made specific references to bawdy houses and other illegal uses. The court held that if anything, the challenged ordinance merely supplemented a statutory scheme that was not comprehensive, and certainly was not inconsistent with it. Therefore, there was no preemption. Respondent's equal protection and privacy right challenges were also unavailing. The ordinance aimed to protect the neighborhood, not to invidiously discriminate between landlords and tenants, and respondent had no right to violate drug laws in the privacy of his apartment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order. The questioned ordinance supplemented but was not at all inconsistent with the state's statute, so there was no preemption. There was no invidious classification between landlords and tenants since purpose was to protect neighborhood, and respondent had no right of privacy to violate drug laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Laws - Preemption by State - Ordinance Authorizing Eviction Based on Illegal Drug Use and Possession </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Respondent tenant may lawfully be evicted from his apartment in a summary proceeding based upon his admitted illegal drug use and possession pursuant to a municipal ordinance which authorizes the maintenance of a &quot;special proceeding to evict a tenant from leased premises ... upon the ground that the premises, or any part thereof, have been used or occupied for the purpose of using or possessing illegal drugs.&quot; The ordinance is not invalid as being preempted by State law.  The fact that illegal drug use and possession are not among the grounds for eviction for illegal use of premises specifically prescribed by Real Property Law &sect; 231 (1) and RPAPL 715 (1) does not demonstrate an impermissible conflict between the State statutory scheme and the local law, or that the State intended to occupy the entire field to the exclusion of local law. Rather, the ordinance is consistent with the State statutory scheme of grounds for eviction based on illegal activity. The ordinance merely supplements the State statutory scheme by adding additional grounds for eviction. The ordinance does not prohibit conduct that the State statutory scheme allows and does not impose additional restrictions on rights granted by the State.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Local Ordinance Authorizing Eviction Based on Illegal Drug Use and Possession </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A municipal ordinance which authorizes the maintenance of a &quot;special proceeding to evict a tenant from leased premises ... upon the ground that the premises, or any part thereof, have been used or occupied for the purpose of using or possessing illegal drugs&quot; does not create an unconstitutionally impermissible distinction between tenants and property owners.  As with the provisions of RPAPL 715 (1) dealing with the use of demised premises for illegal purposes, the clear purpose and effect of the ordinance is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the surrounding community.  Furthermore, the ordinance does not violate a tenant's right to privacy. While people have a privacy interest in their homes, they have no corresponding right to violate the law in the privacy of their homes.  A tenant has no legitimate privacy interest in the possession or use of illegal drugs in his or her apartment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and defendant entered into a sewer agreement pursuant to which defendant agreed to accept wastewater from plaintiff. Defendant was to charge plaintiff based on its assigned capacity until such time as plaintiff installed certain equipment. After plaintiff installed the equipment, defendant continued to charge plaintiff based on its assigned capacity rather than its measured discharges. Plaintiff brought suit alleging, inter alia, breach of contract. Summary judgment was entered in favor of defendant and plaintiff appealed. The court found that the trial court erred in dismissing the breach of contract claim, as the sewer agreement did not unambiguously allow defendant to change any term of the agreement unilaterally. The court erred in dismissing the Contract Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, claim with respect to the sewer agreement, as there was a triable issue of fact whether defendant, in enacting a subsequent sewer ordinance, impaired its contract with plaintiff. The sewer ordinance was not unconstitutional, as the sewer rents bore a rational relationship to compensating for plaintiff's lost revenue due to the underutilization of the plant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of attempted murder in the first-degree.

The court affirmed the conviction. Appellant had reached his 18th birthday and was thus more than 18 years-old at the time of the commission of the crime. The death penalty plea bargain statute was not unconstitutional because appellant was not exposed to the risk of a death sentence as the result of exercising his right to a jury trial. The proof of appellant's intent was legally sufficient.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a decision from the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), granting summary judgment to appellee utility and denying summary judgment to appellant and dismissing its complaint. Appellant contended that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 24-521(b) was applicable to appellee and the protection or relocation of its utility installations were affected by a public construction project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city brought an action to compel appellee utility to either protect or relocate its facilities located within easements that were within the area of a public infrastructure project, citing New York City, N.Y., Admin.

The court reversed and entered summary judgment for appellant, finding appellant's ordinance was applicable whether appellee's facilities were installed pursuant to a franchise from appellant or to installations existing by easement. The court determined that the ordinance did not make any distinction between the two rights and, had such a distinction been intended, the ordinance would have so specified. The court concluded that appellant need not compensate appellee for the effects of reasonable regulations designed to protect the public health and safety and that the results of the legislation would not be a permanent occupancy of appellee's easement, but merely a temporary interference for the public good.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting summary judgment to appellee utility and denying summary judgment to appellant city and dismissing its complaint was reversed, and the complaint of appellant was reinstated and its motion for summary judgment was granted.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Excavation of Street - Utility's Responsibility for &quot;Interference Costs&quot; to Facilities Installed Pursuant to Both Easements and Franchises </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant public utility must comply with plaintiff's &quot;Order Out Notices&quot; directing it to protect or relocate utility installations, at its own expense, at the sites of three City construction projects located in areas where defendant holds permanent easements for its electric distribution facilities.  Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 24-521 (b), which requires public utilities to bear the costs of protecting utility installations affected by public construction projects, supersedes the common-law rule that the City must bear such &quot;interference costs&quot; when the utility installations are maintained pursuant to permanent easements purchased by the utility company from a private landowner, rather than pursuant to a franchise from the City.  The ordinance is not merely a codification of the common-law rule that would limit the utility's responsibility for &quot;interference costs&quot; to facilities installed pursuant to franchises. The ordinance does not distinguish between facilities installed pursuant to City franchises and those installed pursuant to easements. Moreover, the plain language of the ordinance does not contain any exception for utility installations that occupy land by virtue of an easement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Excavation of Street - Utility's Responsibility for &quot;Interference Costs&quot; to Facilities Installed Pursuant to Both Easements and Franchises - No Unconstitutional Regulatory Taking </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 24-521 (b), which requires public utilities to bear the costs of protecting utility installations affected by public construction projects, whether the utility installations are maintained pursuant to permanent easements purchased by the utility company from a private landowner or by City franchises, does not work an unconstitutional taking. Not every regulatory intrusion on property rights amounts to a taking.  While a public utility may have a property right in the land where its installations are situated, its use of that land is subject to reasonable regulation when necessitated by public safety.  By imposing the responsibility for &quot;inference costs&quot; on the utilities, which are best equipped to find cost-effective and safe ways to shield their installations, the ordinance protects the public's interest in uninterrupted utility service and efficient completion of essential public works projects.  Moreover, since there is no permanent occupation of land, there is no per se taking.  Furthermore, defendant utility has not produced sufficient evidence regarding the adverse economic impact of the ordinance to establish a prima facie regulatory taking claim.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A municipality adopted a resolution and enacted a local law opting into a real property tax exemption authorized by N.Y.

Appellant commenced a proceeding under N.Y. Real Prop.

The trial court dismissed appellant's petition, and he challenged its ruling. The court affirmed, holding that the state statute did not preclude municipalities from withdrawing the exemption by appropriate action, and that the retroactive repeal was not unconstitutional because the two month period of retroactivity was relatively short and its application was not unduly harsh or oppressive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant governor appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), denying his motion to dismiss litigation brought against him by plaintiff speaker of the state senate and arising out of dispute over the state budget.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case was a budgetary struggle between plaintiff, speaker of state senate and defendant governor. Despite no showing of authority for the institution of the litigation, the plaintiff was found by the lower court to have the inherent capacity as a legislator to obtain judicial review of his challenge to the defendant's exercise of veto power. Because recognition of such inherent capacity would confer an authority to sue contrary to constitutionally-distributed powers, and because the creation of the plaintiff's cause of action would needlessly propel the judiciary into future political conflicts, the court reversed. The threshold questions raised by the litigation were whether the party seeking judicial intervention had capacity and, if so, whether such party had standing. The plaintiff had not been authorized by the legislature to commence the action. The plaintiff was not a party based upon any purported legal injury to him. Even were the capacity issue deemed resolved on basis of the plaintiff's inherent authority, standing could not be found for the legislator lawsuit. The clerk was directed to enter judgment in favor of defendant dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed and clerk was directed to enter judgment in favor of defendant dismissing the complaint.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislature - Budget - Legal Capacity and Standing of Speaker of Assembly to Challenge Governor's Line-Item Vetoes </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plaintiff lacks the legal capacity as Member and Speaker of the New York State Assembly to challenge the Governor's line-item vetoes in nonappropriation &quot;programmatic&quot; budget bills as unconstitutional under NY Constitution, article IV, &sect; 7.  While budget litigation involving the nature and scope of the delegated authority shared by the Executive and the Legislature may present questions which are &quot;justiciable,&quot; a &quot;justiciable&quot; controversy can only be presented by a party with the capacity and standing to litigate. The Speaker of the Assembly is a legislative officer who appoints committee chairs, allocates staff, expedites or impedes action on bills, and administers the rules internal to the Assembly. The Speaker has no express delegation of power to obtain judicial review against the Governor.  There is no express legal authorization enabling the Speaker to sue, nor has the Legislature conferred capacity on the Speaker. The Speaker has not been prevented from discharging his legal duties as either Speaker or as Member by any action of the Governor.  Moreover, even if the Speaker has the inherent authority to litigate this action, the Speaker lacks standing.  The Speaker has made no allegation of any personal harm nor any remediable interference with the performance of his duties. The institutional injury alleged does not constitute sufficient injury to confer standing.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from judgment of County Court of Schoharie County (New York), convicting and sentencing defendant on his guilty plea to first-degree murder. He contended denial of his suppression motion and refusal to permit him to withdraw his plea were errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Murder investigators focused on the victim's estranged wife, her boyfriend, and his stepbrother, the defendant. They went to Florida and found defendant and his stepbrother. They had no arrest warrants but defendant agreed to talk with them and ultimately confessed and was arrested. The State gave notice of intent to seek the death penalty. Defendant later pleaded guilty to first-degree murder under a plea agreement approved by county court, on condition that the death notice was withdrawn. Subsequent to pleading but prior to sentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea as invalid under Hynes. The court denied the motion and sentenced him. Defendant claimed the court erred in not letting him withdraw his plea which was taken while the death notice was pending, and in denying his motion to suppress statements. The appellate court reversed, finding the U.S. Const. amend. V, VI, were violated by the State's negotiating guilty pleas to first-degree murder while a death penalty notice was pending. It affirmed the suppression ruling, concluding the State proved the voluntariness of defendant's statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed, as plea was entered pursuant to statutory provisions invalidated after defendant's waiver, so he could not have knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal constitutional infirmity, and it was unconstitutional for prosecutors to negotiate guilty pleas to first-degree murder while notice of intent to seek death penalty was pending.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order of the County Court of Albany County (New York), which granted defendants' motion to dismiss a sealed indictment after presentment of the case to the grand jury but prior to defendants' arraignment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants obtained preliminary injunctive relief prohibiting the state Attorney General from criminally prosecuting them for an alleged violation of a Medicaid regulation pending resolution of their declaratory judgment action seeking to strike the regulation as unconstitutionally vague. The Attorney General submitted charges to a grand jury and obtained an indictment. When the State attempted to have defendants arraigned on this indictment, the court refused to arraign them unless and until the preliminary injunction was lifted. Defendants then sought dismissal of the indictment by the court, which was granted. The State appealed, claiming that the court was without jurisdiction to grant defendants' motion to dismiss. The court affirmed, rejecting the State's claim of lack of personal jurisdiction. The court had subject matter jurisdiction over the indictment, the filing of which marked the commencement of the criminal action in that court. The subject indictment was obtained in direct violation of a binding court order and was therefore illegally obtained. Thus, it was well within the inherent power of the lower court to dismiss the same.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order that granted the motion and dismissed defendants' indictment was affirmed because the indictment was obtained in direct violation of a court order and was within the inherent power of the county court to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where the Attorney General obtained a sealed indictment charging defendants with violating a Medicaid regulation in direct violation of a preliminary injunction issued by Supreme Court prohibiting the Attorney General from criminally prosecuting defendants pending resolution of their declaratory judgment action seeking to strike the regulation as unconstitutionally vague, County Court had the inherent power to dismiss the illegally obtained indictment prior to defendants' arraignment. County Court clearly had subject matter jurisdiction over the indictment and did not exceed its power in dismissing it.  Moreover, although CPL 210.20 seemingly requires a defendant's arraignment prior to a motion to dismiss, the statute does not restrict the time period within which a court may dismiss an indictment. Requiring defendants to appear in open court for formal arraignment before obtaining the judicial relief to which they are entitled would merely elevate form over substance, and could result in harm to defendants since the mere unsealing of the indictment could result in their immediate disqualification from continued participation in the Medicaid program (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;18 NYCRR 515.7).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Various petitioners challenged respondent New York utilities agency's adoption of a plan for moving toward competition in the electrical industry; petitioner taxpayer and public interest group sought review after their petition was dismissed. The court reviewed for standing, and held that it was absent. The statute giving taxpayers standing to seek review of government actions applied only to determinations relating directly to fiscal matters. In this case, the nexus to fiscal matters was simply too indefinite to permit standing. A person aggrieved by an administrative determination had common law standing to seek review, but that required demonstrating an injury in fact, falling within the zone of interest the relevant statute sought to protect and different in kind or degree from that suffered by the general public; petitioners could not show such aggrieved status. Finally, petitioners could not show organizational standing because no one member could show standing to sue.</SPAN></P>

The only manifestation of the father's interest in his daughter reflected by the record was the fact that respondent contested petitioner's application in this proceeding to free the child for adoption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon arrest for disorderly conduct, defendant resisted handcuffing, kicked at officers, and banged his head against the police van, damaging the vehicle. After being placed in a secure &quot;lockup,&quot; he continuously, according to videotape and testimony, spit blood and spittle around the area and at personnel. He was ultimately convicted of aggravated harassment of an employee by an inmate under N.Y. Penal Law &sect;240.32, resisting arrest, criminal mischief for damages to the van and lockup door, and criminal possession and sale of a controlled substance. He appealed, claiming insufficient evidence to sustain the drug convictions, error in county court's failure to order a mental competency examination, and that he was not an &quot;inmate&quot; under the statute. The court modified the judgment, finding the statute's restrictive language did eliminate defendant as an &quot;inmate&quot; and required reversal on aggravated harassment, but affirmed as modified, finding no error in remaining convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York) granting defendant's motion for summary judgment and dismissing plaintiff's action for a declaration that the Natural Gas Import Tax, N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 189, 189-a, 189-b, was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation was an out-of-state transporter of natural gas. Defendant tax commissioner sought to impose the Natural Gas Import Tax, N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 189, 189-a, 189-b on plaintiff's consumption of natural gas in the state. Plaintiff sought a declaration that the tax was unconstitutional because it violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. Plaintiff appealed the grant defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court reversed in part insofar as plaintiff's complaint was dismissed and affirmed the order as modified. Plaintiff's constitutional challenge was premature, and plaintiff was required to exhaust administrative remedies. Defendant was entitled to a judgment that the tax was not shown to be facially unconstitutional. Plaintiff failed to show that there was no set of circumstances under which the tax was valid. Nothing in the tax revealed that it discriminated against interstate commerce. The constitutional claim required resolution of factual issues at the administrative level to develop the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Natural Gas Import Tax - Constitutionality under Commerce Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Natural Gas Import Tax (NGIT), which imposes on &quot;every gas importer a monthly privilege tax ... on the privilege or act of importing gas services or causing gas services to be imported into this state for its own use or consumption in this state&quot; (Tax Law &sect; 189 [2] [a]), is not facially unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. The statute does not impermissibly discriminate against out-of-State suppliers who import natural gas into New York for consumption without imposing a similar tax upon New York suppliers who sell natural gas within New York.  Rather, the NGIT was enacted to equalize the tax treatment of out-of-State and in-State suppliers of natural gas. Prior to the passage of the NGIT, consumers of gas services could avoid the burden of taxes imposed by Tax Law &sect; 186 and 186-a by purchasing the service out of State and hiring transportation to carry that service to the consumer's premises in this State.  The NGIT was enacted to impose taxes and surcharges upon out-of-State gas importers commensurate to those imposed upon in-State suppliers under sections 186 and 186-a.  Moreover, the fact that some in-State providers of natural gas not regulated by the Public Service Commission are not required to pass through the tax imposed under sections 186 and 186-a to consumers does not establish that the NGIT is facially defective.  The relevant inquiry is whether there is no set of circumstances under which the statute would be valid, and not whether the statute might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner nonresident property owners challenged the assessed value of their summer home. On appeal, the court held that summary judgment was properly denied on the assessment's excessiveness because plaintiffs raised triable issues whether the improvements increased the property's market value. Whether respondents acted in bad faith in making the assessment did not bear on the correctness of the assessment. The court did not lack jurisdiction over petitioner's constitutional challenge to N.Y. Real Prop. Tax &sect; 425. The limitation of the school tax relief exemption to property serving as a primary residence did not favor residents over nonresidents because it applied to property that was not the owner's primary residence whether the owner was a New York resident or not. Because residents and nonresidents were treated alike, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2 was not implicated. The limitation was also rationally related to a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff purchased a piece of property on which defendant City of New York had performed repairs for the previous owner. Prior to purchase, defendant had not formally filed a lien. After plaintiff bought the property, defendant filed a lien for the repair work. Plaintiff sought a discharge of the alleged improperly placed liens and damages for slander of title. Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment that he was a good faith subsequent purchaser of the property and, therefore, not required to pay the lien. Defendant filed a cross-motion for summary judgment that plaintiff's action was time-barred because it should have been filed within four months as an &quot;Article 78&quot; proceeding. The court denied both motions. The court held a question remained as to whether plaintiff was a bona fide good faith purchaser because plaintiff's pre-purchase title search showed a lis pendens was filed against the premises and he had the same attorney as the administrator of the lis pendens. Since plaintiff's action was not required to be brought under Article 78 the four month time period was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied both motions for summary judgment, finding that a question of fact remained as to whether plaintiff was a subsequent purchaser in good faith and entitled to dismissal of the liens, thus summary judgment was precluded; plaintiff's action was for slander of title and was therefore subject to a one year and not a four month statute of limitations. Consequently, the action was timely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case arose out of petitioner's eviction from Federally subsidized housing project, after marijuana was found in her apartment. The Hearing Officer concluded that petitioner had violated the lease by virtue of the presence of marijuana in her apartment and that she should be evicted. It was clear that marijuana was found in petitioner's apartment, together with an electronic digital scale. The court therefore concluded that there was substantial evidence that petitioner violated an explicit material term of the lease and was subject to eviction. Petitioner's claims that she was unaware of the activity were unpersuasive because neither the lease nor the federal regulation required the element of knowledge. The court held that the eviction was not erroneous. Petitioner's argument that the inspection of the apartment constituted an unconstitutional search and seizure was rejected because sufficient notice was given that petitioner's apartment could be inspected for the presence of controlled substances.</SPAN></P>

In challenging an ordinance, a party must rebut that presumption by establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no reasonable basis for the challenged ordinance. Plaintiff sustained its burden by showing that the fee structure imposed upon contractors and developers for inspection services conducted by the defendant was not assessed or estimated on the basis of reliable factual studies or statistics. Further, plaintiff also established that requiring contractors and developers to pay the actual cost of inspection was not a commonly employed approach in the case of public improvement projects and the fee structure portion of the ordinance lacked uniformity and predictability.</SPAN></P>

Third-party defendant claimed, as an affirmative defense, that defendant's action was barred by N.Y. Work. Comp.

Plaintiff's cognitive injures were not severe enough to constitute permanent and disability: he was ambulatory, his long-term memory was intact, his cognitive ability was consistent with his academic history, and he only seemed to demonstrate some slowness of speech and distractibility.</SPAN></P>

In an action pursuant to Labor Law &sect; 240 (1), plaintiff's injuries, as pleaded and as amplified by the bill of particulars, do not constitute &quot;grave&quot; injuries sufficient to overcome the exclusivity bar of the Workers' Compensation Law and allow defendant premises owner to maintain a third-party action against plaintiff's employer sounding in contribution and indemnification based upon the negligent supervision and protection of plaintiff.  Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 11 bars actions in contribution or indemnification by third parties against the employer &quot;unless such third person proves through competent medical evidence&quot; that the injured worker sustained a &quot;grave injury,&quot; defined as &quot;one or more of the following: death, permanent and total loss of use or amputation of an arm, leg, hand or foot, loss of multiple fingers, loss of multiple toes, paraplegia or quadriplegia, total and permanent blindness, total and permanent deafness, loss of nose, loss of ear, permanent and severe facial disfigurement, loss of an index finger or an acquired injury to the brain caused by an external physical force resulting in permanent total disability.&quot; Here, plaintiff alleged only facial scarring, not &quot;disfigurement.&quot; The scarring is never further described, and is, in any event, not described in any terms satisfying even a broad construction of &quot;disfigurement.&quot; Furthermore, although the pleadings allege the permanency of plaintiff's cognitive injuries, the pleadings do not satisfy the statutory requirement for a &quot;grave injury&quot; that the loss be &quot;total and permanent.&quot; While the medical evidence submitted indicates that plaintiff suffers periods of disorientation and some dementia, particularly in short-term memory, such medical evidence does not, on its face, make out permanent and total disability.

Moreover, even if there were other effective methods by which to accomplish the legislative objective, the courts should not substitute their judgment for that of the Legislature in determining the particular method to meet a given need.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted on numerous charges including two counts each of first degree murder. These counts charged each defendant with perpetrating multiple killings in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;125.27(1)(a)(viii). Following separate jury trials, each defendant was convicted of two counts of murder in the first degree and two counts of criminal weapons possession in the second degree. Defendants both appealed alleging that the legislature did not intend to permit first degree murder convictions to rest upon evidence of accessorial liability and that accessorial liability did not provide a constitutionally permissible basis for a charge of first degree murder. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction because the legislature did intend to allow first degree murder convictions to be predicated upon accessorial liability, and accessorial liability was permissible within the strictures of the U.S. Const. amend.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - First Degree Murder - Convictions for Multiple Killings Predicated upon Accessorial Liability </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendants' noncapital first degree murder convictions for having perpetrated multiple killings by each shooting one rival drug dealer in a concerted effort to kill off two competitors are lawful and should be affirmed.  The murder weapons were traced back to defendants and each defendant's killing of one victim was established beyond a reasonable doubt, even though it could not be established which defendant used which gun. The Legislature clearly intended that the aggravating factor of multiple killings necessary to elevate the offense to first degree murder (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [viii]) be met by evidence of accessorial liability.  The fact that the statute refers to single actors does not preclude an interpretation applying the law to multiple actors (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;General Construction Law &sect; 35).  Moreover, the fact that the Legislature expressly limited accessorial liability in first degree felony murder cases so that a nonshooter can be convicted of first degree felony murder only if, during the perpetration of a designated felony, the nonshooter expressly &quot;commanded&quot; the shooter to kill (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [vii]) does not give rise to the inference that the Legislature intended to limit normal rules of accessorial liability in the multiple killings paragraph of the first degree murder statute.  Rather, the correct interpretation of the Legislature's express limitation on accessorial liability in first degree felony murder prosecutions and its failure to do so for multiple killings is that the Legislature did not intend to alter ordinary rules of accomplice liability as applied to multiple killers. Furthermore the legislative history of the statute eliminates any doubt that the Legislature intended to permit first degree murder prosecutions to be brought against accessorially liable defendants, leaving their degree of participation for the determination of the sentencing jury (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 400.27 [9] [d]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Constitutionality of First Degree Murder Statute - Convictions for Multiple Killings Predicated upon Accessorial Liability </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendants' noncapital first degree murder convictions for having perpetrated multiple killings by each shooting one rival drug dealer in a concerted effort to kill off two competitors (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [viii]) are lawful and should be affirmed.  The murder weapons were traced back to defendants, and each defendant's killing of one victim was established beyond a reasonable doubt, even though it could not be established which defendant used which gun. There is no constitutional impediment to predicating a charge of first degree murder upon accessorial liability.  Accessories who are major participants in intentional killings can be subjected to capital prosecution for their accessorial conduct without running afoul of the Eighth Amendment's proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.  Since defendants are clearly major participants and, thus, could have been sentenced to death, their sentences of life without parole cannot be said to violate the Eighth Amendment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Constitutionality of First Degree Murder Statute - Convictions for Multiple Killings Predicated upon Accessorial Liability - Propriety of Borrowing Statutory Definition of &quot;Criminal Transaction&quot; Used for Double Jeopardy Purposes </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendants' noncapital first degree murder convictions for having perpetrated multiple killings by each shooting one rival drug dealer in a concerted effort to kill off two competitors are lawful and should be affirmed.  The murder weapons were traced back to defendants, and each defendant's killing of one victim was established beyond a reasonable doubt, even though it could not be established which defendant used which gun. The first degree murder statute is not unconstitutionally vague and overly broad insofar as it purports to punish multiple killings that are perpetrated as part of the &quot;same criminal transaction&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [viii]) without supplying a definition of &quot;same criminal transaction.&quot; The statutory definition of &quot;criminal transaction&quot; used for double jeopardy purposes ( CPL 40.10 [2]) may properly be borrowed for application in the first degree murder statute.  Consequently, when construed to include the well-settled definition of &quot;criminal transaction&quot; set forth in the double jeopardy statute, the multiple killing provision of the first degree murder statute is clearly sufficiently definite to give an ordinary person fair notice of the proscribed conduct, i.e., multiple homicides closely related in time or criminal purpose, and it provides the requisite standards to avoid ad hoc, subjective determinations and arbitrary application.  The facts of this case present multiple and nearly simultaneous shootings by the two defendants, clearly acting in concert to kill two rival drug dealers. Under these circumstances, there is no genuine vagueness problem, since the statute unambiguously proscribes multiple killings, which is specific conduct easily avoided by the innocent-minded.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Crime Victims Board - Authority to Maintain Action in Absence of Lawsuit by Crime Victim </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plaintiff Crime Victims Board lacks statutory authority to maintain an action under the &quot;Son of Sam&quot; Law (Executive Law &sect; 632-a) for declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief based upon defendants' failure to have turned over the contracts and moneys with respect to a book based upon the life of a well-known former member of an organized crime family who was convicted under the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (18 USC &sect; 1962 [c]).  The &quot;Son of Sam&quot; Law requires that an entity agreeing to pay any profit from a &quot;crime,&quot; defined as &quot;any felony defined in the penal law or any other chapter of the consolidated laws&quot; (Executive Law &sect; 632-a [1] [a]), &quot;to a person charged with or convicted of that crime,&quot; notify the Board so that the Board can then notify victims of the crime of the existence of &quot;such profits&quot; (Executive Law &sect; 632-a [2] [b]).  The statute, by its express terms, applies only to State crimes and does not encompass a conviction for a Federal offense.  Furthermore, the statute bestows the right to bring a civil action to recover moneys identified as profits from the crime exclusively upon the &quot;crime victim&quot; (Executive Law &sect; 632-a [1] [c]).  The seminal act that confers authority on the Board to act on behalf of the victim is the receipt of the summons and complaint that has been, or will be, filed by the victim of the crime (Executive Law &sect; 632-a [4], [5] [c]).  Only at this juncture may the Board, &quot;acting on behalf of the plaintiff and all other victims,&quot; seek any provisional remedy that is available to the plaintiff victim (Executive Law &sect; 632-a [6]).  The Board has no implied right to prosecute violations of the notification provision of the &quot;Son of Sam&quot; Law, and even if it were able to establish such an inherent right, the statute provides no penalty for the infraction of this provision.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a jury verdict from the Oneida County Court convicting him of two counts of possessing a sexual performance by a child N.Y. Penal Law &sect;263.16. Defendant contended that a visual image stored in a computer hard drive was not a &quot;photograph&quot; within the meaning of &sect;263.00(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state charged defendant with violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 263.16 by possessing computer graphic files which contained images of children engaged in sexual conduct. The court held that a visual image stored in a computer hard drive was a &quot;photograph&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 263.00(4) given the legislative intent to eradicate the market for child pornography in all forms. Defendant licensed social worker sought to use the affirmative defense in &sect; 235.15(1), which provided persons having scientific or educational justification for possessing obscene material. This affirmative defense, by its own terms, applied only to obscenity prosecutions and prosecutions under &sect; 235.21(3) and thus did not apply to child pornography. Child pornography was different from general obscenity both in the degree of depravity involved and in the nature and extent of the harm involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was unanimously affirmed a visual image stored in a computer hard drive was a &quot;photograph&quot; and the affirmative defense permitting possession of obscene materials for educational purposes did not apply to possessing child pornography.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Possessing Sexual Performance by Child - Graphic Images Stored in Computer </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant, a licensed social worker specializing in treating sexually related disorders, was lawfully convicted of possessing a sexual performance by a child (Penal Law &sect; 263.16) based upon visual images stored in the hard drive of his computer depicting young children engaged in sexual activity with adults. The trial court properly charged the jury that, for purposes of the statute, which defines performance as &quot;any play, motion picture, photograph or dance&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 263.00 [4]), the term &quot;photograph&quot; may include a computer graphic image.  Construing the statute as encompassing computer graphic images is consistent with the legislative intent of prohibiting the possession of child pornography in every form as a means of eradicating the market for such material.  The graphic images stored in defendant's computer were either photographs that were converted to digital images by a scanner or taken by a digital camera. A graphic image of a child engaged in sexual conduct captures the child's humiliation and preserves it into the future as permanently as does any photograph. The use of computers to transmit and possess child pornography can only increase the market for child pornography, especially with the clarity of images, the speed of transmission, and the ability to upload and download the images with ease.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Possessing Sexual Performance by Child - &quot;Scientific&quot; Affirmative Defense </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant, a licensed social worker specializing in treating sexually related disorders, was lawfully convicted of possessing a sexual performance by a child (Penal Law &sect; 263.16) based upon visual images stored in the hard drive of his computer depicting young children engaged in sexual activity with adults. The trial court properly denied defendant's request to charge the affirmative defense set forth in Penal Law &sect; 235.15, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protects the use of obscene material by persons for scientific, educational or governmental purposes.  This affirmative defense, by its own terms, applies only to obscenity prosecutions and prosecutions under Penal Law &sect; 235.21 (3) and thus does not apply here.  It is not a violation of equal protection to allow a person who possesses obscene material to assert a &quot;scientific&quot; defense while not allowing a person who possesses child pornography to assert a comparable defense.  Child pornography is not protected speech under either the Federal or State Constitutions.  The compelling State interest in protecting children from being defiled far outweighs the value of allowing the product of the child's defilement to be used for &quot;scientific&quot; purposes.  Moreover, given the nature and extent of the harm to children who are involved in the production of pornography, the compelling interest of the State in eradicating the market for that despicable material and the de minimis value of child pornography for scientific or educational purposes, it is a reasonable determination by the Legislature not to allow a person charged with possession of child pornography to assert the &quot;scientific&quot; defense.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Possessing Sexual Performance by Child - Mistake of Law Justification Defense </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant, a licensed social worker specializing in treating sexually related disorders, was lawfully convicted of possessing a sexual performance by a child (Penal Law &sect; 263.16) based upon visual images stored in the hard drive of his computer depicting young children engaged in sexual activity with adults. Defendant was not entitled to a charge on the mistake of law justification defense set forth in Penal Law &sect; 15.20 (2) (a), which relieves a person of criminal liability if he or she engaged in such conduct in reliance upon an official statement of the law contained in a statute or other enactment.  Defendant's contention that Penal Law &sect; 263.00 (4) is ambiguous in defining a performance as, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a photograph or other visual representation only if exhibited before an audience, and that his mistaken belief that the possession of a computer image was not illegal unless exhibited to an audience was reasonable does not support a charge on the defense of justification.  The mistake of law defense was intended to be a very narrow escape valve and does not apply even where a defendant has made a good-faith, even reasonable but mistaken, interpretation of criminal statutes.  The defense applies only where an individual demonstrates an effort to learn what the law is, relies on the validity of the law and, later, it is determined that there was a mistake in the law itself.  That is not the case here.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The collective bargaining agreement between the district and the association contained a provision that teachers could receive any of the religious holidays designated by the New York State Commissioner of Education as a paid day off that would not be charged to any other leave. The district later advised teachers who had requested such days off that it would no longer abide by the provision because it was unconstitutional. Appellants filed a grievance and sought to invoke their contractual right to arbitration. The district brought a proceeding pursuant to Rule 7503 to permanently stay arbitration. The trial court granted the stay, and appellants sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly found that the dispute was not subject to arbitration because the provision violated the Establishment Clause (Clause) under the First Amendment. The provision violated the Clause because it rewarded teachers who claimed to be religiously observant with more days off than those afforded to agnostics, atheists, and others who were less observant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence established the elements of the two types of disorderly conduct of which defendant was convicted arising from her participation in an Occupy Wall Street protest where the People's proof demonstrated that defendant obstructed pedestrian traffic (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 240.20 [5]) by laying down on a busy Wall Street sidewalk at 4:00 p.m. on a trading day, side-by-side with other Occupy protestors, and refused to comply with a lawful police order to disperse (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 240.20 [6]). Defendant testified that the Occupy demonstrators chose the particular time and location, and to lie down rather than stand, in order to communicate their message about the injustices created by Wall Street &quot;to as many people as possible,&quot; and she conceded that she possessed the requisite mens rea to sustain her convictions, i.e., that she acted with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly created a risk thereof. Moreover, the video recording evidence showed that the police placed barricades around the pedestrian area due to the demonstration, that scores of pedestrians were pinned against the barricades and that the police could be heard yelling &quot;keep back&quot; at the crowd, which was precluded from traversing across the sidewalk for fear of trampling the protestors. When conduct, even taking the form of protest, substantially interferes with vehicular or pedestrian traffic, prosecutions for disorderly conduct are appropriate and constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Criminal Trespass -- Facial Sufficiency of Accusatory Instrument</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The accusatory instrument charging defendant with criminal trespass in the second degree based on allegations that he &quot;wait[ed] at the entrance&quot; of complainant's apartment building &quot;until someone entered the building[,] follow[ed] someone into said building and then walk[ed] up the stairs to the complainant's floor&quot; was facially sufficient, as it provided reasonable cause to believe that defendant &quot;knowingly enter[ed] or remain[ed] unlawfully in a dwelling&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 140.15 [1]). Circumstantial evidence may establish the lack of license or privilege in criminal trespass prosecutions. Thus, the People were not required to negate the possibility that one of the numerous residents of the building invited defendant to enter. Defendant, who, the complainant alleged, did not reside in the building, gained entry not by being &quot;buzzed in&quot; by a resident or another person authorized to do so, but by waiting for someone to enter and following that person into the building. A common area of an apartment building which is separated from the outside by a locked door and buzzer system is part of a &quot;dwelling&quot; as defined in Penal Law &sect; 140.00 (3). The allegations of the nature of defendant's entry into the premises, along with the conduct exhibited following the entry, therefore satisfied the pleading requirements of an information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Stalking -- Facial Sufficiency of Accusatory Instrument -- Course of Conduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The accusatory instrument charging defendant with stalking in the fourth degree based on allegations that he contacted complainant four times, escalating from a mailed card to an explicit invitation to engage in sexual conduct placed at the door to complainant's apartment, was facially sufficient. It is an element of the offense that defendant intentionally engaged in a course of conduct, meaning a pattern of conduct composed of a series of acts over a period of time evidencing a continuity of purpose. In the stalking context, &quot;continuity of purpose&quot; is not the intent to cause a particular fear of harm but to commit acts which create a reasonable likelihood of fear of harm. The four incidents represented a series of intentional acts united in a continuity of purpose that established a course of conduct directed at complainant with no legitimate purpose. Even if the accusatory instrument did not assert facts upon which, following the first two contacts, a reasonable person would feel threatened, combined with the final two letters which were delivered in so personal a manner, the instrument clearly set forth a course of conduct that defendant should have known was likely to cause reasonable fear of material harm to the complainant's physical health or safety. Although defendant's contact occurred over a nearly two-year period, time was not the controlling factor given the pattern of escalating behavior; rather, it was defendant's persistence as manifested in his ever more personal and transgressive behavior that established a course of conduct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although defendant failed to preserve the issue for review, an information that charged defendant with, among other offenses, stalking in the fourth degree, harassment in the second degree, and endangering the welfare of a child over a 10-month period was not defective for lack of specificity as it provided defendant with fair notice of the time, place, and manner of the offenses that she was alleged to have committed and a fair opportunity to answer the charges and to prepare a defense. The offenses charged were characterized as continuing offenses since, by definition, they may be committed by multiple acts which occur over a period of time and, as a result, they can be comprised of time spans that might otherwise be considered unreasonably excessive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Stalking -- Facial Sufficiency of Information</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An information that charged defendant with stalking in the fourth degree pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 120.45 (1), alleging that defendant repeatedly followed complainant near her home and around the surrounding neighborhood, hid behind trees and bushes near complainant's house, stood in front of and stared at complainant's house, followed complainant's two children who were under the age of 17, and sent letters to complainant's father blaming complainant for adversity in defendant's life, was facially sufficient. While defendant contended that she had a legitimate purpose in pursuing complainant, a school principal, in an effort to get back her job as a substitute teacher, the &quot;no legitimate purpose&quot; element of Penal Law &sect; 120.45 (1) could be inferred from the frequency of the alleged course of conduct. Although defendant was not alleged to have made any verbal threats, the sheer volume of her attempts at communicating with complainant made defendant's course of conduct one which was likely to have caused reasonable fear of material harm to her safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An information that charged defendant with harassment in the second degree pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 240.26 (2), alleging, among other things, that defendant repeatedly followed complainant near her home and around the surrounding neighborhood, was facially sufficient as the information alleged that defendant had followed complainant in or about a public place on numerous occasions. Defendant's intent to harass, annoy, or alarm complainant was reasonably inferred from the sheer volume of defendant's attempted unwanted communications, especially after both complainant and the police had requested that such attempts at communication cease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. While an information that charged defendant with harassment in the second degree pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 240.26 (3), alleging, among other things, that defendant repeatedly sent letters to complainant's father blaming complainant for adversity in defendant's life, was facially sufficient, defendant's conviction was vacated where the People offered three letters writ ten to complainant's father into evidence but he did not testify at the trial. Without the letters in evidence, and with little testimony elicited from complainant pertaining to them, the People failed to prove that, by sending these letters to complainant's father, defendant had engaged in a course of conduct intended to harass, annoy, or alarm complainant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-- Attempt -- Endangering Welfare of Child -- Sufficiency of Evidence at Trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. While an information that charged defendant with two counts of attempted endangering the welfare of a child pursuant to Penal Law &sect;&sect;110.00 and 260.10 (1), alleging that defendant, among other things, followed complainant's two children who were under the age of 17, was facially sufficient, defendant's conviction was vacated where no nexus was established by the People at trial between defendant's conduct and the likelihood of injury toward complainant's children. Complainant only testified to one occasion when defendant followed one of her sons &quot;parallel across the street down the block,&quot; which event occurred before the dates of the offending conduct alleged in the information. The People failed to prove the element of Penal Law &sect; 260.10 (1) that defendant knowingly acted in a manner likely to be injurious to the physical, mental or moral welfare of complainant's children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Hempstead Town Code &sect; 2-106, which provides for an on-site inspection as a condition of obtaining a rental occupancy permit, is facially constitutional. Although Code &sect; 2-106 requires an inspection of the premises as a condition of the issuance of a rental permit, and Code &sect; 2-110 authorizes the code enforcement officer to enter the premises upon consent (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Code &sect; 2-103), Code &sect; 2-111 provides for an application to the District Court by a code enforcement officer for a search warrant upon a showing of reasonable cause to believe that code violations exist.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Validity -- Tree Preservation Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The Tree Preservation and Landscape Maintenance Law of the Code of the Village of Montebello (Tree Law), which contained the provisions under which defendant was charged for having cut down trees on his property that he allegedly did not have a permit to remove (Code of Village of Montebello &sect;&sect; 176-6 [A] [1]; 176-7 [C]), is not ultra vires. The stated legislative intent behind the Tree Law is to preserve trees, provide appropriate aesthetic streetscapes, and regulate and prevent conditions which cause increased surface runoff, soil erosion, and decreased soil fertility (Code of Village of Montebello &sect; 176-2). General Municipal Law &sect; 96-b, which specifically allows for the adoption of tree preservation laws, supports that intent as it recognizes that the destructive and indiscriminate removal of trees and related vegetation causes increased municipal costs for proper drainage control, impairs the benefits of occupancy of existing residential properties and impairs the stability and value of both improved and unimproved real property in the area of destruction. Moreover, an ordinance can have the purpose of promoting aesthetic considerations which bear substantially on the economic, social and cultural community. Furthermore, the Tree Law is not ultra vires based on the fees associated with the law. The power of a village to charge fees must be reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of the regulatory program. Here, not only does the Tree Law properly require reimbursement of the professional consultant fees paid by the village in connection with the review of a tree cutting application, it also provides for an audit procedure for the fees.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Taking of Property -- Ripeness Doctrine </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant's claim that the provisions of the Tree Preservation and Landscape Maintenance Law of the Code of the Village of Montebello (Tree Law), under which he was charged for having cut down trees on his property that he allegedly did not have a permit to remove (Code of Village of Montebello &sect;&sect; 176-6 [A] [1]; 176-7 [C]), resulted in a taking of his property without compensation was not ripe for review. A claim that the application of a government ordinance effects a taking of a property interest is not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the ordinance has reached a final decision regarding the application of the ordinance to the property at issue. Tree Law &sect; 176-6 (B) (2) and (D) delineate the process by which a property owner can seek a retroactive application for a permit to remove trees and an exception to any requirement of chapter 176, and Code of the Village of Montebello &sect; 65-6 provides the process for an applicant to dispute the amount of consultant fees charged by the village. Here, the record revealed that defendant started the procedure to obtain an exception to the requirements of chapter 176, but thereafter abandoned his application, which application was not approved or denied. Consequently, since defendant failed to fully pursue an exception to the Tree Law, and given the fact that he did not show that there was a final decision, in that the process could be reinstated and continued, his takings claim was not ripe. Defendant also failed to show that he had sought compensation through state procedures providing for same and had not received compensation. Furthermore, defendant's claim that the consultant fees of the Tree Law resulted in a taking of his property without due process of law was not ripe for review inasmuch as chapter 65 of the Code of the Village of Montebello clearly provides for adequate process, which defendant, admittedly, chose not to pursue.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Validity -- Tree Preservation Law -- Due Process Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The Tree Preservation and Landscape Maintenance Law of the Code of the Village of Montebello (Tree Law), which contained the provisions under which defendant was charged for having cut down trees on his property that he allegedly did not have a permit to remove (Code of Village of Montebello &sect;&sect; 176-6 [A] [1]; 176-7 [C]), was reasonable and did not constitute a deprivation of property without due process of law. Tree Law &sect; 176-6 (A) (1) delineates what a person cannot do, with respect to trees, on privately owned property, and Tree Law &sect; 176-6 (B) delineates the permitted activities on the property, and provides when a property owner must obtain a permit to remove a tree. Moreover, the Tree Law was enacted for the legitimate governmental purpose of preserving trees, providing appropriate aesthetic streetscapes, and regulating and preventing conditions which cause increased surface runoff, soil erosion, and decreased soil fertility (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tree Law &sect; 176-2), and is supported by the home rule grant of authority. Furthermore, there is a reasonable relationship between the ends sought to be achieved by the ordinance and the means used (i.e., the permit and fee process) to achieve that end.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Validity -- Tree Preservation Law -- Equal Protection Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Sections 176-6 (A) (1) and 176-7 (C) of the Tree Preservation and Landscape Maintenance Law of the Code of the Village of Montebello (Tree Law), under which defendant was charged for having cut down trees on his property that he did not have a permit to remove, did not violate defendant's equal protection rights. The legislative intent behind the Tree Law--preserving trees, providing appropriate aesthetic streetscapes, and regulating and preventing conditions which cause increased surface runoff, soil erosion, and decreased soil fertility--advances a valid public policy basis for affecting some groups differently than others, i.e., those owning property in the Village of Montebello prior to the implementation of the Tree Law and those purchasing property in the village after its implementation. Moreover, defendant failed to show that he was intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there was no rational basis for the difference in treatment.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Validity -- Constitutionality of Town Law Regulating Signs </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 57A of the Town of Brookhaven Code, which contained the provision under which defendant was convicted for having placed signs advertising its business on public property (Town of Brookhaven Code &sect; 57A-11), is unconstitutional. Zoning ordinances will be upheld if there is a reasonable relation between the end sought to be achieved and the means adopted to achieve it. Time, place and manner restrictions are permissible if they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, serve a significant governmental interest, and leave open ample alternative channels for the communication of the information. Here, the stated purpose of chapter 57A, which was essentially to avoid unsightly proliferation of unnecessary signs in the interests of traffic safety and esthetics, represented a substantial government interest which was constitutionally furthered by section 57A-11. Although the chapter barred commercial advertising on public lands and roads, it provided ample opportunity to advertise commercial activities on private land and was thus sufficiently narrowly tailored. In addition, the law was not unconstitutionally vague as the terms employed were either specifically defined in the chapter or amenable to the commonsense understanding. However, chapter 57A unconstitutionally favored commercial speech over noncommercial speech. The chapter's language of limitation, &quot;only the following signs&quot; are &quot;permitted&quot; or &quot;allowed,&quot; imposed broad restrictions on noncommercial speech that was not &quot;political.&quot; Further, commercial advertising was permitted in every zoning district aside from public lands and roads while noncommercial speech was barred in most contexts in which commercial speech was allowed. Given the use of the language of limitation and the relative absence of media of expression for noncommercial speech, it was impossible to sever the unconstitutional portions of chapter 57A. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The verdict convicting defendant of stalking in the fourth degree (Penal Law &sect; 120.45 [2]) based on defendant's actions, after being told by a police detective to cease all contact and communication with the complainant, in making gestures to provoke and aggravate complainant and producing and distributing T-shirts displaying degrading pictures of the complainant accompanied by derogatory, vulgar or suggestive comments was not against the weight of the evidence. The complainant described how defendant's actions and the existence of the T-shirts caused material harm to her mental and emotional health. Moreover, defendant, at the time of his arrest, stated that he knew the complainant would learn of the T-shirts and would get angry.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Penal Law &sect; 120.45 (2) was not unconstitutionally overbroad as applied to the stalking in the fourth degree prosecution of defendant for producing and distributing four T-shirts displaying degrading pictures of the complainant accompanied by derogatory, vulgar or suggestive comments after being told by a police detective to cease all contact and communication with the complainant. The statute did not impermissibly punish defendant's use of photographs of the complainant or improperly punish his constitutionally protected speech. A defendant's right to free speech is permissibly subordinated to the complainant's right to be free of repetitive, unwanted verbal and nonverbal communications which are likely to instill in the complainant a reasonable fear of harm. Here, defendant unacceptably intruded upon the complainant's privacy rights, and his unwanted nonverbal communications inflicted immeasurable emotional harm upon the complainant, which conduct was precisely what the stalking statute intended to criminalize. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353 was not unconstitutionally vague on its face or as applied to defendant, who was charged with failing to groom her dog for a prolonged period of time and failing to seek medical care, as the phrase &quot;unjustifiably injures&quot; is sufficiently definite to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that conduct such as that engaged in by defendant was proscribed by the statute, and provided officials with clear standards of enforcement. A citizen can readily comprehend that he or she must refrain from causing unjustifiable injury to a domestic pet by failing to groom the animal for several months and to seek medical care for the animal when clear, objective signs are present that the animal needs such care. Moreover, in light of the significant physical maladies the dog developed as a result of defendant's neglect and the odor the dog emitted because of those maladies, no reasonable pet owner would fail to seek medical care for the animal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Animals -- Cruelty to Animals -- Failure to Groom and Provide Medical Care to Dog</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Legally sufficient evidence existed to establish defendant's guilt of animal cruelty and falsely reporting an incident in the third degree where the trial evidence, including the testimony of the experienced veterinarian who treated defendant's dog, established that the dog had not been groomed for a prolonged period of time causing the dog to develop medical problems which defendant failed to seek medical care for despite clear, objective signs that the dog needed medical attention. Furthermore, the evidence established that defendant, in a written statement voluntarily provided to the law enforcement officer investigating the dog's condition, falsely reported both that another person had custody of the dog in the three-month period preceding the date on which defendant signed the statement and that the dog's maladies developed during that period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (1), which provides that a person is guilty of loitering if he or she loiters, remains or wanders about in a public place for the purpose of begging, is unconstitutional because it violates the freedom of speech guarantee of the First Amendment. Begging is as inseparable from speech as is charitable solicitation and is subject to the same level of First Amendment scrutiny. Even if the People may assert the State's interests in the statute for the first time on appeal, the asserted interests in maintaining public order, reducing citizen fear of coercive encounters with panhandlers, and preventing fraud could be sufficiently served by measures less destructive of First Amendment interests than the sweeping prohibition of all begging in all public places at all times that Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (1) imposes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Harassment -- Intent</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The testimony of the arresting officer at defendant's suppression hearing did not demonstrate the existence of probable cause for defendant's arrest for harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.26 [2]). The officer testified that defendant had &quot;followed a . . . young male Hispanic . . . for several blocks&quot;; that the person then handed defendant what appeared to be a pack of cigarettes; and that the person subsequently told the arresting officer that defendant had asked him for money and cigarettes, and told another police officer that he had become &quot;nervous&quot; and given defendant a pack of cigarettes. An intent to &quot;harass, annoy or alarm&quot; may be inferred from the conduct of a defendant, but the arresting officer's testimony fell short of establishing that defendant harbored the requisite &quot;intent to harass, annoy or alarm&quot; when he &quot;follow[ed]&quot; the &quot;young male Hispanic,&quot; who was not a witness at the hearing. The officer did not testify that defendant had any interaction with that person while following him, or that defendant followed him so closely as to appear threatening. Although the person allegedly became &quot;nervous&quot; when defendant spoke to him, that fact did not prove that defendant had any intent to &quot;harass, annoy or alarm&quot; him. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant failed to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of the municipal ordinance under which she was convicted for failing to obtain a rental occupancy permit before renting out her dwelling for residential occupancy. Since the town code otherwise provides for the inspection of residential dwellings upon consent and pursuant to a warrant, the challenged code provision does not unconstitutionally compel a residential property owner to consent to a warrantless search of the property.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant failed to demonstrate that a town ordinance, which makes it unlawful to erect, alter or maintain a building structure without permits, was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant failed to rebut the strong presumption in favor of the ordinance's constitutionality. The ordinance clearly and unequivocally put defendant on notice of the proscribed activity by informing her that it is unlawful to erect, alter or maintain any building or structure for which a permit is required until such a permit has been issued. It is a valid content-neutral ordinance of general applicability, adopted to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The evidence in a nonjury trial was legally insufficient to sustain defendant's conviction on one of four counts of an accusatory instrument charging her with violating a town ordinance by erecting, altering or maintaining a building structure without the required permits. The testimony of the town inspector, that he had seen a &quot;three piece bathroom&quot; in the basement of the property, without explaining what specifically he had observed, was insufficient to establish defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt with regard to the third count. However, the inspector's testimony was sufficient to establish defendant's guilt on the other three counts involving construction of a fence, garage bedrooms and a basement kitchen. Furthermore, the evidence was legally insufficient to establish defendant's guilt on two of four counts involving a second building she owned. The inspector's testimony that he had observed two wall air conditioner units on this building without explaining how the building had been altered was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt defendant's guilt of erecting, altering or maintaining a building or structure without a permit. The inspector's testimony was, however, sufficient to establish defendant's guilt with respect to the remaining two counts involving a fence and a deck roof.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The evidence in a nonjury trial was legally sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction on one of two counts of an accusatory instrument charging her with violating a town ordinance by failing to obtain a rental occupancy permit for her property. The town inspector's testimony was sufficient to establish defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in that there were separate entrances for segregated parts of the dwelling, and the dwelling had partitions or internal doors which might serve to bar access between segregated portions of the dwelling. However, since the People did not establish that a rental permit was needed for each purported separate rental unit inside of a building, the proof was sufficient to find defendant guilty of only one count. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the prosecution of defendants, participants in a &quot;Critical Mass&quot; bicycle ride, for parading without a permit in violation of Administrative Code of the City of NY &sect; 10-110, the permit law under which defendants were convicted was unconstitutional on its face because it failed to adequately define those events that required a permit (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;38 RCNY 19-02 [former (a)]). At the time defendants were arrested and convicted, a &quot;parade or procession&quot; was defined as &quot;any march, motorcade, caravan, promenade, foot or bicycle race, or similar event of any kind, upon any public street or roadway&quot; (38 RCNY 19-02 [former (a)]). As it applied to essentially any group of people moving on a public street, including small groups, it burdened substantially more speech and expressive conduct than was necessary to further the City's legitimate interests in crowd and traffic control. Moreover, the permit law under which defendants were convicted afforded the City, acting through the police commissioner, unduly broad discretion in determining whether a particular event required a permit. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court erroneously dismissed, sua sponte, the accusatory instrument charging defendant with unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle on the ground that the licensing statutes (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 502 [1]; &sect; 509 [1]), which require identity documentation as a condition precedent to issuance of a driver's license, are unconstitutional as applied to defendant, a noncitizen. The constitutional issues were not before the court given the absence of evidence that the defendant had standing to advance the issues. The record did not contain any indication that defendant was an undocumented alien, had applied for and been denied a license, or had been denied a license on statutory, regulatory or constitutional grounds. Assuming defendant had standing, the court failed to provide the Attorney General with the requisite notice and opportunity to intervene. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurisdiction of Offenses -- Criminal Division of Supreme Court in Bronx County</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supreme Court properly acquired jurisdiction over the prosecution of defendant for attempted criminal contempt in the second degree, which was initiated in Criminal Court by misdemeanor information and transferred to Criminal Division of the Supreme Court in Bronx County pursuant to 22 NYCRR 142.2, notwithstanding that it was not initiated by indictment or Supreme Court information as specified in CPL 210.05. CPL 210.05 circumscribes a prosecutor's ability to invoke a superior court's jurisdiction and cannot be read as a limitation on Supreme Court's historical and constitutional power to preside over misdemeanor cases. There is no constitutional requirement that a defendant charged with a misdemeanor be prosecuted by indictment. Further, an information may serve in misdemeanor cases as a basis both for the commencement and prosecution of a criminal action. Thus, there is no statutory impediment to the transfer of misdemeanor cases from Criminal Court to Supreme Court, particularly given the express recognition in the Criminal Procedure Law that Supreme Court has trial jurisdiction over misdemeanors concurrent with that of the local criminal courts (CPL 10.20 [1]), and that Criminal Court's jurisdiction over misdemeanors is subject to divestiture by a superior court in any particular case (CPL 10.30 [1] [b]). </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nonpayment summary proceeding, wherein petitioner served the notice of petition and petition on respondent tenants by affixing the papers to the door of the premises and mailing the papers by certified and first-class mail after having made five attempts over two days to personally deliver the papers, petitioner was entitled to a default money judgment for rent arrears. A money judgment is available upon a tenant's default in a summary proceeding, without regard to the manner of service effected therein, upon a showing that such service is sufficient to support the entry of a money judgment in a plenary action. The &quot;due diligence&quot; required under CPLR 308 (4) before resort may be had to conspicuous place service provides a service procedure sufficient to meet constitutional due process requirements, and requires a higher level of effort than the &quot;reasonable application&quot; standard set forth in RPAPL 735 (1) for service in summary proceedings. Moreover, allowing default money judgments upon substituted service in summary proceedings advances the interest of judicial economy and discourages tenants from evading personal delivery. Here, petitioner's efforts at personal delivery satisfied both the &quot;reasonable application&quot; and &quot;due diligence&quot; standards. </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1) (a) prohibits communications with a person by telephone in a &quot;manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.&quot; As applied to defendant, the statute was properly directed to communications made to an unwilling recipient wherein substantial privacy interests were invaded in an essentially intolerable manner.

The evidence showed that defendant engaged in conduct which tended to effect the commission of the crime in that he intended to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm the complainant by communicating with her by telephone in a manner likely to cause her annoyance or alarm. Defendant's phone calls were an unwanted invasion of complainant's privacy. No public interest was involved, since defendant's messages were made to a private citizen on her private telephone line. Proof of a physical threat was not required, since it is not an element of Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1). </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate his conviction of renting premises without first obtaining rental permits in violation of section 2-103 of the Code of the Town of North Hempstead was properly denied even though sections 2-104 (B) (3) and 2-113 of the ordinance requiring an owner to disclose the names, ages and relationships of the occupants as part of the permit process were declared unconstitutional as violative of the tenants' right to privacy in an appellate ruling in defendant's declaratory judgment action eight months after defendant had pleaded guilty to the charges. In the declaratory judgment action the Appellate Division did not rule on the constitutionality of section 2-103 because that issue had not been raised in the court below. Defendant had raised the constitutionality of section 2-103 in the criminal action prior to pleading guilty and the court abstained from ruling on it. Although in pleading guilty defendant waived his right to appeal, such guilty plea and waiver did not foreclose defendant's right to appeal on the ground that the statute that he violated was unconstitutional. Defendant failed to take a direct appeal from the judgments of conviction, in which he could have raised the constitutionality of section 2-103 regardless of the procedural posture of the declaratory judgment action. He thereby forfeited review of that issue. Under these circumstances, the declaratory judgment action and the subsequent appeal had no bearing on the disposition of defendant's case. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In defendant's prosecution for driving while impaired (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [1]) and failure to use a designated lane (Vehicle &amp; Traffic Law &sect;1128 [c]), the certified copies of the simulator solution certification and the calibration/maintenance record of the breath test instrument used by police officers to test defendant's blood alcohol content (BAC) were properly admitted as business records as part of the foundation requirements for proof of the results of the analysis of the alcohol content of defendant's blood. The certification records were not testimonial in nature and could thus be admitted as business records without violating defendant's right of confrontation. The certifications were prepared in the course of the certifiers' routine official duties and did not result from structured police questioning or any official request to gather incriminating evidence. The certifications did not contain formalized testimonial materials but merely served an administrative function to ensure properly functioning BAC testing machines.  </SPAN></P>

In defendant's prosecution for driving while impaired (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [1]) and failure to use a designated lane (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1128 [c]) resulting from an accident when defendant swerved from her traffic lane while trying to retrieve a dropped cell phone, the arresting officers' police reports were properly admitted into evidence as business records with regard to the officers' personal observations of defendant's behavior. Morever, since the trial court sustained defendant's objection to so much of the reports' contents as constituted hearsay and evidence cumulative of other testimony, and in view of the overwhelming proof of guilt, any error in admitting the reports was harmless. The officers' account of their personal experience and police training with respect to the effects of alcohol on behavior sufficed to enable the trial court to properly evaluate their opinions as to the degree of defendant's impairment as a result of alcohol consumption.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In defendant's prosecution for driving while impaired (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [1]) and failure to use a designated lane (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1128 [c]), the trial court properly admitted the results of the chemical test of defendant's blood alcohol content (BAC), notwithstanding the fact that the officer who administered the test did not maintain a &quot;continuous observation&quot; of defendant for 15 minutes prior to the test (10 NYCRR 59.5) during the few minutes his attention was devoted to preparing the BAC machine for testing. There was no evidence that the officer failed to observe any event that would have undermined the accuracy of the test results. In any event, the &quot;continuous observation&quot; requirement should not be strictly construed. &quot;Continuous observation&quot; is not a condition precedent for the test results' admission, but merely goes to the weight to be afforded the test results. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was lawfully convicted of dumping debris, consisting of bramble and brush, on premises that were not an approved disposal facility in violation of a town ordinance that prohibited &quot;debris of any sort or any other organic or inorganic material&quot; from being &quot;dumped, deposited or otherwise disposed of or upon any . . . area whether publically or privately owned&quot; except at a public disposal facility or a private disposal facility licensed by the Town. Defendant failed to demonstrate that the ordinance was facially unconstitutional. The Town possessed the authority to impose reasonable limitations on the dumping of waste within the town (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [c]; Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 [1] [i], [ii]). In addition, the State's regulation of solid waste management did not preempt the Town from enacting regulations that were at least equally stringent (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;ECL 27-0711). Furthermore, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. The ordinance clearly apprised a person of ordinary intelligence that the dumping of bramble and brush on other than licensed facilities constituted a violation.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the prosecution of defendant arising out of the recovery of a loaded firearm from his vehicle, defendant's acquittal on the first count of the indictment charging criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (Penal Law &sect; 265.02 [4]) precluded his retrial on the lesser included count of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree upon which the jury was unable to reach a verdict (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 310.70 [2]). The only issue presented to the jury was whether defendant had knowing possession of the loaded firearm at the time and place charged. The only rational basis for the acquittal verdict on the higher count was the jury's unanimous conclusion that the People's evidence in the form of the integrated testimony of a single police witness failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt defendant's knowing possession of the weapon in question. Under these circumstances, collateral estoppel and double jeopardy principles precluded defendant's retrial on the second count of the indictment. Moreover, defendant's waiver resulting from the failure to object to the submission of the second count to the jury (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 300.50 [1]) did not survive the first trial as to permit an otherwise unconstitutional retrial on that count.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action seeking damages for rent overcharges in which plaintiff rent-stabilized tenant alleged that defendant landlord collected the full legal regulated rent even though the lease provided for a lower, preferential rent in consideration for plaintiff's relocation, which preferential rent was to continue during the renewal periods, defendant was entitled to assert an affirmative defense against the cause of action for breach of the rent overcharge statutes, but not an affirmative defense against the cause of action for common-law breach of contract. A 2003 amendment to the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 permitted an owner to discontinue a preferential rent and resume charging the legal regulated rent upon renewal (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 26-511 [c] [14]). As preferential rents are now revocable, the preferential rent listed in the parties' lease did not become the legal regulated or authorized rent, and a collection of rent in excess of the preferential rent constituted only a breach of the agreement of the parties and not an offense against the rent overcharge statutes.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No class action under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (47 USC &sect; 227 [TCPA]) is available in the New York State courts. The TCPA itself cedes authority to accept, decline, and otherwise define jurisdiction over private TCPA actions to the states. CPLR 901 (b) bars a class action to recover a statutory penalty, such as that provided for by the TCPA, unless the statute providing for the penalty specifically authorizes such a class action. The TCPA does not specifically authorize class actions. Thus, since the TCPA cedes jurisdictional authority over private causes of actions to the states, and CPLR 901 (b) prohibits class actions for statutory penalties unless the statute specifically provides for such actions, plaintiff's proposed TCPA class action was not permissible in the New York courts.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (4), which prohibits being masked or disguised in a public place while congregating with others who are also masked or disguised, does not infringe upon any First Amendment right to anonymous speech or constitute impermissible viewpoint discrimination.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In the prosecution of defendants for loitering in violation of Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (4), the trial court properly convicted defendants upon proof, unchallenged on either sufficiency or weight of the evidence grounds, that they and others gathered next to each other &quot;as a group&quot; and covered their faces with bandanas while shouting epithets and political slogans during a May Day demonstration in a public park. The trial court did not improperly shift the burden of proof from the People to defendants on any recognized element of the loitering offense. The trial court's in limine ruling, which allowed defendants to introduce evidence as to the nonstatutory &quot;legitimate purpose&quot; defense erroneously carved out by the motion court, did not ease the People's trial burden or cause defendants any discernible prejudice. Nor was it necessary for the underlying informations to allege the inapplicability of the &quot;masquerade party or like entertainment&quot; exemption contained in Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (4). The masquerade party exemption is a proviso to be raised as a defense by a defendant, rather than an exception to be pleaded and proved by the People. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In an action pursuant to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) alleging that defendants transmitted unsolicited advertisements to plaintiff's facsimile (fax) machine without authorization, the fax at issue fell within the TCPA's definition of an &quot;unsolicited advertisement&quot; (47 USC &sect; 227 [b] [3]). The fax included a &quot;strong buy&quot; recommendation for the stock described therein, indicated that defendant recommended the stock, gave the stock's price, &quot;Reasons To Own The Stock&quot; and a contact number. The fax also gave subscription information for future issues of the &quot;newsletter.&quot; It therefore proposed a commercial transaction for the stock, the newsletter, or both, and fell within the ambit of the statute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In an action pursuant to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) alleging that defendants transmitted unsolicited advertisements to plaintiff's facsimile (fax) machine without authorization, the fax at issue fell within the TCPA's definition of an &quot;unsolicited advertisement&quot; (47 USC &sect; 227 [b] [3]). The fax had the effect and purpose of advertising, albeit indirectly, defendant's services. Its essential purpose was to propose a commercial transaction. It mentioned defendant's company name, connecting defendant to the contents of the fax, and invited calls for further information. The fax pitched a product or service under the guise of providing information about it, and therefore proposed a commercial transaction, notwithstanding that the proposal in so many words would occur when the fax recipient called the sender. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In determining whether a facsimile (fax) transmitted to a plaintiff's fax machine without authorization falls within the definition of an &quot;unsolicited advertisement&quot; under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) (47 USC &sect; 227 [b] [3]), the court's scrutiny is not limited to the four corners of the fax. Rather, such factors as who the sender is, as well as his motives, purposes and intentions for sending the fax, are all relevant. It is possible that faxes textually conveying the same ideas or even faxes that are facially identical could fall inside or outside the TCPA's ambit depending upon considerations outside the content of the fax itself. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a New York City Civil Court action pursuant to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), plaintiff was not entitled to equitable relief in the form of an injunction barring defendant from sending further faxes. The remedies available pursuant to the TCPA are limited to those &quot;otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State&quot; (47 USC &sect; 227 [b] [3]), and plaintiff's forum, the New York City Civil Court, does not have equity jurisdiction to grant, as a form of primary relief, the requested injunction (CCA 202). </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) (47 USC &sect; 227) is constitutional notwithstanding that, in proscribing the use of any telephone facsimile (fax) machine, computer, or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine, it restricts commercial speech. The TCPA does not ban any advertising content at all. It simply forbids its transmission by fax to an unwilling recipient, while leaving open to the advertiser all other means of conveying the information. Furthermore, the evils the TCPA seeks to address, shifting of advertising costs to recipients and depriving them of use of their own equipment, are brought about by the act of the fax transmission itself, not by some posited remote result of that transmission. The TCPA restrictions upon transmission of unsolicited advertisements by facsimile are constitutional, since the statute addresses a substantial government interest, materially advances that interest, and is not more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was properly convicted of violating Town Code of the Town of Smithtown &sect; 207-2 (B) (2) for allowing her dogs to bark for more than 15 minutes cumulatively in the space of an hour. The noise ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. It was clearly intended to address excessive noise of canine origin, and defines the noise intensity and duration involved, stating that &quot;a 'noise disturbance from a barking dog' shall be defined as that created by a dog barking for fifteen (15) minutes in any one-hour interval.&quot; The statute further defines a &quot;noise disturbance,&quot; in part, as a sound that &quot;[d]isturbs a reasonable person of normal sensitivities&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">id.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &sect; 207-1). To accept defendant's proffered construction of &quot;barking&quot; to exclude the &quot;howling&quot; or &quot;yelping&quot; noises that the complainant testified defendant's dogs were making would introduce into the statute the very vagueness infirmity of which defendant complained. A reasonable person can understand that whatever sound their breed of dog customarily makes that meets the other elements of the ordinance constitutes &quot;a noise disturbance from a barking dog.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Argument and Conduct of Counsel--Prosecutor's Remarks in Summation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's conviction must be reversed because the prosecutor's remarks in summation exceeded the bounds of propriety and fair response to the defense, and the cumulative effect of these remarks deprived defendant of a fair trial.  The prosecutor, without any attempt to temper his language, improperly stated on a number of occasions that defendant had lied about various matters.  He also vouched for the complainant on several occasions, and certain of his remarks went beyond any permissible and fair argument that the complainant had testified truthfully.  Moreover, the prosecutor improperly denigrated defense counsel on a number of occasions, and ended his summation with gratuitous remarks that had no other purpose but to inflame the jury.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law--Validity of Statute--Aggravated Harassment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The second degree aggravated harassment statute (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1], [2]) is not unconstitutional as applied to defendant, who is charged with making threatening and harassing telephone calls to the complainant, a former employee, and with mailing to her copies of his adult publication's editorials and adult-content television show segments. The statute does not prohibit speech or expression, and the publication of defendant's remarks in his magazine and the making of them on the air on his show formed no part of the prosecution.  Defendant mailed the editorial material directly to complainant, along with a threatening letter, and left her threatening phone messages at home.  The statute is properly directed to communications, made, as here, to an unwilling recipient, wherein substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Harassment--Aggravated Harassment--Sufficiency of Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a prosecution for second degree harassment and aggravated second degree harassment where defendant is charged with making threatening and harassing telephone calls to the complainant, a former employee, and with mailing to her copies of his adult publication's editorials and adult-content television show segments, the People introduced admissible evidence from which a rational jury could find that defendant made each of the communications underlying each of the counts of which he was convicted either in a manner likely to annoy or alarm, or without any legitimate purpose of communication, and that he did so with the requisite intent.  A jury could properly find that defendant used abusive and profane language extensively in all the communications at issue, knowing complainant's sensitivity to such language, and that various portions of the language constituted threats, indicating both intent and that the complainant was an unwilling recipient. A jury could also properly find, in the case of the phone calls, that they did not attempt to discuss any legitimate subject matter, and from this, that they were made with no legitimate purpose of communication.  In the case of the letter accompanying the editorials, the jury was entitled to find that the letter contained threats and, furthermore, that the communication was made in a manner likely to annoy or alarm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes--Defendant as Witness--Impeachment--Published Statements </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The prosecution properly used editorial statements published in defendant's magazine, to the effect that terrorists should fly airplanes into and send anthrax letters to the District Attorney's office, in cross-examining defendant.  While a pretrial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Sandoval</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ruling had forbidden use of those statements to impeach defendant's credibility, defendant subsequently opened the door to their use by placing his character for peacefulness at issue.  It is not the content of defendant's words, but their potential for provocation to violence, that is relevant to the prosecution.  Defendant's words were, self-admittedly, meant to be inflammatory when made.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Regulation of Signs </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Town of Babylon's fee-based, temporary sign ordinance, which requires a permit to erect a noncommercial sign in a residential district subject to a 30-day, nonrenewable expiration period, is not facially unconstitutional for First Amendment purposes.  The ordinance is sufficiently &quot;tailored&quot; to satisfy constitutional requirements.  The ordinance permits noncommercial speech in both commercial and residential zones without regard to content, and there are no content-based limitations on time or exemptions from the fee.  The temporary permits, available on demand for use in &quot;all districts&quot; for a nominal fee, provide an &quot;ample&quot; alternative channel for communication. The nominal permit fees and 30-day time limitation are permissible burdens incidental to the Town's legitimate and substantial interest in sign regulation. Moreover, the ordinance's &quot;advance notice&quot; requirement does not imply an impermissible prior restraint as to protected content, in view of the absence of discretionary authority and content-based guidelines. Furthermore, defendant's equal protection challenge to the ordinance cannot be determined because of his failure to seek a permit.  Accordingly, defendant's conviction of erecting a sign critical of local law enforcement practices on the lawn of his home without the requisite permit is affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant was lawfully convicted of aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1]) for having left messages on complainants' workplace telephone answering machine, containing threats to them and their families, profanely abusive language, and thinly-veiled references to retaliation for the perceived nonperformance of their official duties. The statute, in proscribing the use of a telephone to communicate in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm, is neither unconstitutional on its face nor as applied to the facts herein.  Government employees retain substantial privacy interests at their official workplaces, which may be protected from invasion in an essentially intolerable manner.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Stalking Statute Not Void for Vagueness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant was lawfully convicted of stalking in the fourth degree ( Penal Law &sect; 120.45) where the evidence established that defendant, after offering complainant unsolicited gifts during a street encounter, followed her every day for more than five weeks, making her feel &quot;very scared&quot; and &quot;very uncomfortable.&quot; The statute is not unconstitutionally vague. The statute makes it unlawful to &quot;intentionally, and for no legitimate purpose, engage[] in a course of conduct directed at a specific person&quot; that would likely instill reasonable fear of material physical harm in the targeted person or that actually causes material mental or emotional harm to the targeted person, where the violator knows or reasonably should know that such conduct would elicit the requisite fear or cause the requisite harm. The stalking statute thus provides sufficient notice of the conduct proscribed and is written in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. The term &quot;legitimate purpose,&quot; when read in conjunction with the rest of the statutory language, including the requirement that the course of conduct be undertaken &quot;intentionally,&quot; conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.  Furthermore, the statute's lack of a specific intent component does not render the statute void for vagueness. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Stay in Summary Proceeding Conditioned upon Deposit of Judgment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;RPAPL 747-a, which, in nonpayment proceedings brought in the City of New York, bars the granting of stays after five days have elapsed following the entry of judgment unless the amount of the judgment has either been paid to the landlord or deposited into court, is unconstitutional as applied to temporary stays in orders to show cause seeking relief from a final judgment or warrant.  The statute, as applied to such stays, impermissibly interferes with the court's inherent judicial function. The power to grant such stays is a power which is essential to the just resolution of the summary proceeding, and it is not within the competence of the Legislature to proscribe the granting of such stays unless a mandatory deposit has been made.  While it may be true that the need to prevent prejudice to the landlord ordinarily dictates that a stay be conditioned upon a deposit of the judgment amount, there are circumstances in which a deposit of the full amount should be dispensed with.  Accordingly, respondent tenant was properly granted a temporary stay of the warrant of eviction without posting a deposit of the judgment amount, particularly in light of the long duration of the tenancy, where the Department of Social Services (DSS) checks she had to pay the judgment with could not be deposited because they were not made out to the proper party, and the lateness in payment was due to a delay in receiving funds from DSS.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent town zoning board of appeals' determination that a proposed sober living residence was not a one-family dwelling under the town zoning code was not arbitrary and capricious, given the size and physical layout of the residence, the services and treatments to be provided, and the transience of the average resident. The proposed residence consisted of 7,300 square feet of space, with at least eight bedrooms, a dormitory-style bathroom, common areas, rooms for offices, counseling and treatment activities, and a parking lot for 12 cars. It would be licensed and regulated by the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS), and petitioner was required, pursuant to its contract with OASAS and regulations, to provide around-the-clock services and supervision. As such, the operational dynamics of the residence were distinguished from the common one-family dwelling. The purpose of the residence was to provide transitional support from chemical dependency treatment programs into the community, and the adult residents would have had no prior relationships with each other, and stay at the residence for an average of five to eight months. Thus, the proposed residence was unlike a group home with unrelated residents living interdependently in relatively stable relationships and sharing household activities and responsibilities as the functional equivalent of a family.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent town zoning board of appeals' determination that a proposed sober living residence in the nature of an assisted living residential facility was a convalescent home under the town zoning code was arbitrary and capricious since there was no evidence that petitioner would be providing nursing care to the residents. While credentialed professional and paraprofessional staff would be required to provide services to the residents, those services would entail supervision, substance abuse and other supportive counseling, assistance in securing out-patient medical services and other services, vocational services, and transportation to and from appointments. The residents would already have undergone intensive medical treatment for substance abuse at a different facility before being transferred to the proposed transitional facility. Moreover, while the proposed facility would include a &quot;meds room,&quot; and staff would dispense previously prescribed medications to the residents as part of their effort to help residents develop a routine that would allow them to function independently in the community, nursing staff was not required to dispense such medications.</SPAN></P>

The proposed residence would be neither self-governed nor self-supporting, trained staff would supervise the residents around the clock, engage in counseling, and distribute medications, and the duration of residency was expected to be transient, on the order of months. Moreover, other zoning districts within the town permitted the same type of facility as of right or by special permit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 19-190, which imposes criminal liability on &quot;any driver of a motor vehicle who [fails to yield to a pedestrian who has the right of way] and thereby causes physical injury&quot; to the pedestrian (Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 [b]), is not rendered unconstitutional by the exclusion in section 19-190 (c) for incidents in which &quot;the failure to yield and/or physical injury was not caused by the driver's failure to exercise due care.&quot; The exclusion is precise, limited and fully contained within the statute, and therefore reflects the New York City Council's intent that the failure to exercise &quot;due care&quot; is an element of the crime. While the use of a civil negligence standard is inappropriate in a criminal prosecution, there is no basis to conclude, solely upon the use of the words &quot;due care,&quot; that the Council meant to drastically change the historical distinction between criminal and civil liability. Thus, the use of the term &quot;due care&quot; incorporates the criminal negligence mens rea of Penal Law &sect; 15.05 (4), which requires the finder of fact to look to the defendant's own awareness of the risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Preemption by State -- Failure to Yield Right of Way -- Mental Culpability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 19-190 (b), which imposes criminal liability on &quot;any driver of a motor vehicle who [fails to yield to a pedestrian who has the right of way] and thereby causes physical injury&quot; to the pedestrian, is not preempted by Penal Law article 15. Penal Law &sect; 15.15 (2) mandates that, unless a statute defining a crime clearly indicates a legislative intent to impose strict liability, the statute is to be construed to be a crime of &quot;mental culpability.&quot; As Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 (b) is not clearly designated as a crime of strict liability, Penal Law &sect; 15.15 (2) requires the &quot;due care&quot; language of Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 (c), which excludes from criminal liability incidents in which &quot;the failure to yield and/or physical injury was not caused by the driver's failure to exercise due care,&quot; to be read as one of the Penal Law's culpable mental states in order to give effect to the intention of the New York City Council. Thus, reading the definition of criminal negligence in Penal Law &sect; 15.05 (4) into Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 does not conflict with state law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 19-190 (b), which imposes criminal liability on &quot;any driver of a motor vehicle who [fails to yield to a pedestrian who has the right of way] and thereby causes physical injury&quot; to the pedestrian, is not preempted by state law regulating a driver's duty to yield to pedestrians who have the right of way (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1146). The City of New York has the power to pass legislation regulating the safety of its citizens so long as the local law is not inconsistent with any state law already governing the same conduct and does not seek to occupy a field of regulation for which the State has assumed full regulatory responsibility. Moreover, Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1642 (a) provides the City of New York with authority to pass laws &quot;regulat[ing] traffic on or pedestrian use of any highway&quot; in the City, and that such laws &quot;shall supersede the provisions of [the Vehicle and Traffic Law] where inconsistent or in conflict with respect to the ... [r]ight of way of vehicles and pedestrians&quot; (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1642 [a] [10]). Thus, even were Administrative Code &sect; 19-190 (b) in conflict with the Vehicle and Traffic Law, it would supersede the state law in this area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a prosecution in which crack cocaine was recovered from defendant's pocket following an accident allegedly caused by defendant's failure to yield the right of way to a pedestrian, the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance was properly joined with the other charges in the accusatory instrument because it was part of the same criminal transaction. CPL 200.20 (2) (a) provides that &quot;[t]wo offenses are 'joinable' when . . . [t]hey are based upon the same act or upon the same criminal transaction, as that term is defined in [CPL 40.10 (2)].&quot; Defendant was alleged to have been in possession of crack cocaine while operating his motor vehicle, and the drug possession charge was thus so closely related in time, place and date to the other charges to have been part of the same criminal transaction.</SPAN></P>
