Latham II (motion to suppress), and John D. Telleen, Judges. A criminal defendant appeals his convictions for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, failure to affix a drug tax stamp, and knowingly transporting a revolver in a vehicle. He contends the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence discovered after officers opened a locked safe they found inside the defendant's vehicle during a warrantless search incident to arrest.</SPAN></P>

Sanders, 312 N.W.2d 534, 539 because Belton no longer set forth the proper scope of the search incident to arrest exception under the Iowa Constitution; instead, the search incident to arrest exception to the warrant requirement under Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 8 was tethered to its original underlying dual justifications; [2]-The warrantless search of the container incident to defendant's arrest violated his rights under art. I, &sect; 8 because, although the van had two occupants, both defendant and his passenger were secured in a squad car before the search of the vehicle and the safe were undertaken; the officer who performed the search testified there was no way defendant could have retrieved anything from the locked safe while in custody in the squad car.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sought unemployment benefits after his discharge from employment. An administrative law judge (ALJ) found that the employer discharged him for misconduct and, as a result, he was not entitled to benefits.

In his petition for judicial review, the employee named the employer in the caption as a &quot;defendant.&quot; The caption made no mention of the EAB. The trial court dismissed the petition. The court of appeals upheld the judgment. On review, the court held that the requirement in Iowa Code &sect; 17A.19(4) (2011) that the EAB be named in the petition was satisfied. The agency was not named in the caption, but was named in the body of the petition. Although the petition did not use the term &quot;respondent,&quot; the EAB was identified as the agency that made a final decision from which an appeal was sought. The petition provided the information required by the statute, and the legislative purpose behind the &quot;naming&quot; requirement, the provision of timely notice to all parties of the nature of the action, was satisfied.

Ovrom, Judge. The State appeals from a district court order requiring the Iowa Department of Public Health to issue a birth certificate naming the nonbirthing spouse in a lesbian marriage as the parent of a child born to the couple while married.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Polk County District Court (Iowa) ordered appellant Department to issue both appellee first spouse, the birthing spouse, and appellee second spouse, the nonbirthing spouse, a birth certificate naming both spouses as parents, where they were lesbians. It also stayed its ruling as other birth certificates the Department might issue to married lesbian couples, pending an appeal. The state supreme court granted the Department's review request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first spouse and the second spouse, both women, were legally married. Thereafter, the first spouse gave birth to their child. The birth certificate the Department issues only listed the first spouse as the child's parent. The space for the second parent's name was blank. The Department declined their request that a birth certificate be issued recognizing both the first spouse and second spouse as the child's parents. The trial court found that pursuant to the presumption of parentage statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 144.13(2) (2011), the Department had to issue a birth certificate listing both the first spouse and second spouse as parents and stayed its ruling as to other married lesbian couples until an appeal of that ruling occurred. The state supreme court found it could not interpret that statute in the same way, but did find that treating a married lesbian couple differently than a married male couple would be treated under that statute, without a rational ground for doing so, was a violation of the equal protection provisions of Iowa Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 6, and required the remedy of naming the second spouse as the child's parents birth certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court affirmed the trial court's judgment ordering the Department to issue a birth certificate naming both the first spouse and second spouse as parents. It also remanded the case to the trial court for a lifting of the relevant stay and entry of an order directing the Department to issue a birth certificate naming the second spouse as the parent of the child.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court reversed, stating that a parole agreement containing a prospective search provision was insufficient evidence to establish consent. Such a contract revealed an absence of bargaining power on behalf of the parolee, rendering contract principles inadequate to entitle the State to enforce compliance of a search provision. The purported consent extracted from a prisoner as a condition of release failed to constitute voluntary consent. As a mandatory term of parole, such consent would also have the effect of justifying the search on the basis of parole status, which was not permitted. More was needed and a consent provision in a parole agreement did not supply this additional justification because it failed to pass the test of voluntariness required under Iowa Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State appealed from a judgment of the Polk County District Court, Iowa, in a judicial review proceeding finding that the disparate tax treatment of the personal property of incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs), as contrasted with that of competitive long distance companies (CLDTCs) and wireless providers, violated Iowa's equal protection provision, set forth in Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 6, as applied to appellee company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that imposing a tax on the Iowa-based personal property of ILECs, but not on that of CLDTCs, did not violate art. I, &sect; 6. The differential tax treatment of these enterprises was rationally related to legitimate state interests in encouraging the development of new competitive telecommunications infrastructure, while raising revenue from those providers that historically had a regulated monopoly and continued to enjoy some advantages of that monopoly. The legislature could have rationally believed that ILECs had a powerful built-in competitive advantage based on their existing facilities, whose development had been underwritten by Iowa ratepayers over the past century. The State made a plausible showing that ILECs retained some vestiges of their former monopoly status that made it appropriate for the State to tax their property while relieving potential developers of competing infrastructure from a similar burden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant, who was the driver of a car used in a drive-by shooting, had been convicted of murder. The jury in defendant's case had been instructed on both murder and felony-murder, with the predicate act being terrorism under former Iowa Code &sect; 708.6 (1997). He filed his application more than three years after the conviction, but less than three years after the court's decision in State v. Heemstra, 721 N.W.2d 549 (2006), which held that an act causing willful injury and also causing the victim's death could not serve as the predicate felony for felony-murder. The applicant argued that the retroactivity of Heemstra was required by the equal protection, due process, and separation of powers clauses of the Iowa Constitution as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The court decided that &sect; 822.3 did not bar the applicant's constitutional claims because the time limit did not apply to a ground of fact or law that could not have been raised during its three-year period, and the applicant could not have raised his present argument before Heemstra was decided because it was foreclosed by controlling precedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of the petition and remanded the case for further proceedings on whether retroactive application of Heemstra was required by the equal protection, due process, and separation of powers clauses of the Iowa Constitution, or the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sex offender was arrested for committing sex acts with a minor. He was convicted, served his sentence, was discharged, soon reoffended, was convicted again, was sentenced, and was later discharged. Following commitment proceedings, a jury found he suffered from a mental abnormality making it more likely than not that he would reoffend. He was then civilly committed under Iowa Code ch. 229A (2011). The State filed annual review reports to keep him civilly committed. The second one stated there was no evidence of a change in his mental abnormality. He petitioned for a final hearing on that annual review, and his claims for either outright discharge or placement in the transitional release program. His expert's report stated that the sex offender felt that he was ready for discharge. The trial court denied his final hearing request. On his petition for writ of certiorari, the state supreme court found his expert's report did not contain an unequivocal opinion that he should be discharged and, thus, the State's opinion could be found to be more credible than his expert's opinion on the issue under Iowa Code &sect; 229A.8(5)(e)(1) (2011) of whether he was entitled to a final hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defamation case concerned a book written by the author. His ex-wife and her father sued the author and the publisher for libel, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The district court denied the author's and publisher's motions for summary judgment. On review, the supreme court upheld the denial of the author's motion for summary judgment, but held that the publisher, as a bona fide book publisher, should be considered a &quot;media defendant.&quot; Therefore, the supreme court found that the publisher was entitled to summary judgment because the ex-wife and her father failed to provide sufficient proof to establish a prima facie case under the established standards applicable to media defendants. The supreme court also declined the author's and publisher's invitation to revise the common law of defamation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's theater offered nude and seminude dance performances. The city's &quot;Sexually Oriented Business Ordinance&quot; imposed a range of regulations on sexually oriented businesses.

The high court held that state law preempted enforcement of the ordinance. The general assembly intended to include live performances in the definition of &quot;material&quot; in Iowa Code &sect; 728.1(3) for the purposes of the obscenity statute, Iowa Code ch. 728. Therefore, to be consistent with its construction of Iowa Code &sect; 728.11 in Chelsea Theater Corp. v.

The tenant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa Supreme Court held that Dubuque, Iowa, City Code &sect; 6-6-4(B)(3), an ordinance allowing immediate action to protect the public health, safety or welfare, was not preempted by Iowa Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (IURLTA), Iowa Code ch. 562A, or specifically by the eviction requirements of Iowa Code &sect; 562A.33. The ordinance therefore authorized the city, acting through the private landlord, to cure a situation involving a tenant who left the water and gas stove running for hours at a time, in an attempt to scare away bats and heat the apartment. However, it was beyond the scope of the city's order to abate the nuisance when the landlord entered the apartment for the purpose of seizing the tenant's belongings and removing them from the premises. Further, the landlord's refusal to return the security deposit was done in bad faith. The landlord knew he owed the tenant the money, knew the tenant had a pressing need, had no plausible reason for not paying it, and simply ignored the demand by the tenant's counsel. The tenant was entitled to actual damages for the abusive entry and punitive damages for bad faith retention of the security deposit.</SPAN></P>

The State did not commit a Brady violation by failing to disclose the transcript of a 911 call made by the victim's ex-boyfriend to police stating that the victim was being beaten by a black male; though the caller's statements might have been used to impeach the victim's testimony as to the source of her injuries, disclosure of the transcript of the 911 call before the verdict would not have given rise to a reasonable probability of a different outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor filed an action against the lessee for damages related to the termination of an apartment lease. The lessor attempted to serve notice under Iowa's long-arm statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 617.3 (2007), by certified mail at a forwarding address provided by the lessee upon the termination of his tenancy in the apartment. The notice, however, was returned by postal authorities and the lessor took no further action to achieve service. The district court entered a default judgment against the lessee but the supreme court reversed. The underlying default judgment that gave rise to the garnishment was void for lack of personal jurisdiction over the lessee as provided in &sect; 617.3. As a result, the motion to quash the garnishment in the case should have been granted. The lessee, at the time of service could not be found at the address. Thus, it was not a valid address under &sect; 617.3. When mail was returned &quot;Attempted--Not Known&quot; and &quot;Unable to Forward,&quot; &sect; 617.3 required the party to take additional steps to achieve service, namely, resend the notice to a valid address where the lessee might be effectively be served by mail or achieve personal service pursuant to Iowa R.

The first social worker was entitled to absolute immunity from liability under &sect; 1983 for referring the case to the county attorney to file the child in need of assistance (CINA) petition and for filing an affidavit requesting temporary custody to DHS. She was entitled to qualified immunity for her investigatory acts and for filing an affidavit as a complaining witness. The second social worker was entitled to qualified immunity for failing to ensure that the child was provided adequate medical care, protection, and supervision while in foster care, even though concerns had been raised. Appellants failed to present a genuine issue of material fact as to whether either social worker violated clearly established constitutional rights. The court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the ITCA on claims that were not filed with the state appeal board, and the exception to liability under Iowa Code &sect; 669.14(4) applied to claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and tortious interference with the parent-child relationship because they were the functional equivalent of misrepresentation and deceit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wholesale producer was the country's largest producer of wind energy and owned 65 wind facilities in the United States and Canada, including facilities in Iowa. The wholesaler argued that the regulated electric utility was pursuing its wind facility to increase its presence in the wholesale energy market and that the awarding of ratemaking principles by the Board gave the utility a competitive advantage in the wholesale market. The court held that the Board had correctly interpreted Iowa Code &sect; 476.53(4)(c)(2)'s &quot;need&quot; requirement to include needs based on considerations besides present capacity, such as fuel diversity, the supply of less expensive energy to consumers, and compliance with future environmental regulations requiring clean energy. The &quot;other feasible alternatives&quot; comparison allowed comparison with alternatives of different generation types. There was substantial evidence that the proposed facility would satisfy a need for an electric supply with lower emissions, lower cost, and fuel diversity. The application of the statute to the utility did not violate equal protection or the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, and she periodically took time away from work when her anxiety disorder would lead to bouts of depression. The employee requested leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to cope with stress-induced anxiety brought about by family turmoil. The employee returned to work after having been gone for several days, and was demoted for failing to follow absentee policies by calling in to work each day she was absent. The employee was ultimately terminated. The reviewing court held that the State preserved its sovereign immunity argument, as the State generally argued it was immune from suit. Also, the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding the State constructively waived its immunity by placing the FMLA leave provisions in its employee handbook. The employee presented no evidence to suggest that the inclusion of the self-care leave provisions in the handbook was for any purpose other than to comply with the federal regulation implementing the FMLA. It was incumbent on the employee to produce evidence to show the State did not place the provisions in its handbook to comply with federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students and parents sued the State, Governor, state education department, and department director alleging that they failed to establish standards, failed to enforce any standards, failed to adopt effective educator pay systems, and failed to establish and maintain an adequate education delivery system. The result, the students and parents contended, was a failure to provide similar educational opportunities for all of Iowa's students. Specifically, they alleged violations of the due process, equal protection, and education clauses of the Iowa Constitution, as well as Iowa Code &sect; 256.37 (2007). For relief, they requested entry of a declaratory judgment that the named defendants had failed to provide an effective education. The trial court entered a judgment that dismissed the relevant petition for failure to state a claim. The state supreme court found that it did not need to determine whether there was a fundamental right to education in Iowa. It also noted that the case was not about Iowa's funding of education. Rather, it found that the educational policies to be pursued in Iowa was a matter for elected representatives to consider rather than the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor item vetoed several provisions in Senate File 517, an appropriations bill passed in the final days of the Eighty-Fourth General Assembly. Primarily at issue was $8.66 million the Iowa Legislature appropriated in Section 15(3) for the operation of Iowa Workforce Development (IWD) field offices. The Governor, without vetoing that appropriation, item vetoed Section 15(3)(c), prohibiting the closure of field offices, and Section 15(5), defining &quot;field office&quot; to require the presence of a staff person. The Governor also item vetoed Section 20, which restricted IWD from spending any appropriated funds on the National Career Readiness Certificate Program, without item vetoing any of the several appropriations to IWD in Senate File 517. The court ruled that the Governor's item veto of Section 15(5) was unconstitutional. To allow the Governor to veto the definition in Senate File 517, &sect; 15(5) without vetoing the accompanying appropriation in Section 15(3)(b) would impermissibly distort legislative intent or divert money appropriated by the Legislature for one purpose so that it could be used for another. Also, the Governor's item veto of Section 20 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

In doing so, one officer took hold of his arm. Defendant then tried to run away, but the officers tackled and handcuffed him. Following a bench trial, he was found guilty of and convicted of possession with intent to deliver, violation of the Drug Tax Stamp Act, and interference with official acts.

The state supreme court found that the force used was constitutionally reasonable, and not in violation of his right to be free from unreasonable seizures under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a decision from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, which, on remand, certified a class action and entered judgment in favor of appellee certified class in a dispute over franchise fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An action was filed against the city relating to an increase in franchise fees. On remand, the district court certified a class of all city utilities customers who paid the fees within a certain time period. The district court ordered the city to refund the class a certain amount of money. This appeal followed. On review, the appellate court determined that there was no abuse of discretion in a refusal to decertify the class. The heart of the case was the illegality of the franchise fee imposed by the city, and there was no fundamental conflict among the class members as to that issue. The district court's application of Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.267(1) did not violate due process where class members were not given the option of excluding themselves from the class under the circumstances of this case. Members had no due process right to opt out of the class and the failure of the rules of civil procedure to allow them to do so was not unconstitutional. However, certain amounts allocated or not allocated by the district court as proper components of the franchise fees had to be modified. An invitation to order the city to adopt a new franchise fee ordinance was properly rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was cited for violating appellee county's road protection ordinance for driving a tractor equipped with steel cleats on a hard surfaced roadway. The Iowa District Court for Mitchell County held that the ordinance was both neutral and generally applicable, and was not motivated by religious animosity. The district court denied the motion to dismiss and sustained the ordinance against appellant's First Amendment challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fellow member of appellant's church explained the use of steel wheels was a religious practice and a church rule. The church members were prohibited from driving motorized vehicles with rubber tires. The underinclusion of the ordinance undermined its general applicability. The county ordinance was not narrowly tailored to achieve the stated objective of road preservation. The county engineer testified that steel wheels hastened deterioration of the county's roads. However, the county engineer admitted that various factors lead to road deterioration, and he could not quantify the impact of steel wheels on the county's normal schedule of road repair or resurfacing. Given the lack of evidence of the degree to which the steel cleats harmed the county's roads, the undisputed fact that other events caused road damage, and the undisputed fact that the county had tolerated steel cleats for many years before 2009, it was difficult to see that an outright ban on those cleats was necessary to serve a compelling state interest. Thus, the application of ordinance to appellant violated his rights of free exercise of religion under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reverse the district court's judgment and remanded the case to the district court for entry of an order of dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During voir dire in his trial on a charge of assaulting a police officer resulting in bodily injury stemming from a drunken altercation outside of a bar, defendant sought to use a peremptory challenge to remove a Hispanic juror. The district court denied the strike and seated the juror after finding that defendant was using his strikes in a racially discriminatory manner. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that, although the district court erred in refusing to allow the strike of the potential juror, defendant failed to show prejudice. On review, the court held that defendant's explanations for wanting to strike the juror--his past dealings with the police and his experience as a bartender with intoxicated bar patrons--were reasonable, valid, and race-neutral reasons for striking the juror. Defendant's reasons were legitimate, and they were not so implausible that they could be viewed as a mere pretext for discrimination. Iowa R. Crim. P. 2.18(9) required automatic reversal of defendant's conviction when the trial court's erroneous ruling on a reverse-Batson challenge led to the denial of the peremptory challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit challenging the constitutionality of Iowa's campaign finance laws, a federal district court certified two questions concerning whether a corporation must form a political committee under Iowa Code &sect; 69A.102(18) if it wanted to spend more than $750 advocating the election or defeat of Iowa candidates and whether the corporation became a permanent organization under Iowa Code &sect; 68A.402(9) by virtue of such expenditures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonprofit organization sought to make independent expenditures to support candidates who it believed would fight to protect life. In its suit against defendants, the executive director and board members of the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board (the Board), it challenged Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 68A.102(18) and 68A.402(9) (2011), alleging that they unconstitutionally imposed political action committee (PAC) status on corporations whose major purpose was something other than nominating and electing candidates. The district court, uncertain about the proper interpretation of Iowa law, certified the two questions. Recognizing its discretion whether to answer certified questions, pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 684A.1, the court chose to answer the questions because they were pure questions of law and were not purely academic or extraneous. It agreed with the Board that a corporation making independent expenditures aggregating over $750 in a calendar year became an independent expenditure committee within the meaning of Iowa Code &sect; 68A.404 but not a political committee within the meaning of Iowa Code &sect; 68A.102(18) or a permanent organization within the meaning of Iowa Code &sect; 68A.402(9).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient sued the hospital for negligent credentialing after he suffered complications from its doctor's two back surgeries. The hospital produced the doctor's credentialing file and relied on it at trial. The jury awarded him damages. The hospital appealed. The state supreme found certain evidence should have been excluded; thus, it remanded the case for a new trial. The appellate court then held in a separate case that the contents of a hospital's credentialing file fell within the scope of Iowa Code &sect; 147.135 (2009)'s peer review protection if the peer review committee possessed the documents. The hospital moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted that motion. The state supreme court found that the hospital could object to use of the documents from the credentialing file on remand, as the law of the case doctrine did not bar the hospital from changing course given that the state supreme court's earlier opinion did not decide the credentialing file's admissibility. It also found that Iowa Code &sect; 147.135(2) (2009) set forth not only a privilege, but also a separate rule of inadmissibility, so principles of waiver applicable in other contexts did not govern.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because his consent to search the vehicle was involuntary. Specifically, defendant asserted that the totality of the circumstances, particularly the coercive nature of the traffic stop, demonstrated that his consent was not the product of a free and unconstrained choice. The supreme court agreed. The officer subjected defendant to a pat-down search, which included a command to empty defendant's pockets, before detaining defendant in the police cruiser. There was nothing to suggest that the officer detected danger from defendant, who was stopped over a civil infraction. The pat-down search, however, projected authority over defendant and was a factor to be considered in determining the voluntariness of the search. Defendant found himself seized in the front seat of a squad car with his own vehicle parked on the side of a public highway. The lack of any statement that defendant was free to leave or that he could decline to give his consent to the search was a strong factor cutting against the voluntariness of the search. Therefore, the consent was not voluntary under Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. Defendant failed to preserve a claim of prosecutorial misconduct. He objected only that the question was argumentative; the district court sustained the objection and the question was withdrawn; defendant then asked for no further relief such as a mistrial. Defendant could not obtain a new trial based on prosecutorial misconduct when he failed to move for a mistrial at the time. Based on the exchange, the district court had no reason to believe that defendant wanted anything further done with respect to the prosecutor's improper question. The prosecutor's questioning was directed toward a legitimate trial theme: if defendant's mental condition was such that he lacked capacity to commit attempted murder, how could he function satisfactorily on other occasions despite the same mental condition. Still, the phrasing of the question was inflammatory and improper. However, the isolated incident of misconduct was not so severe or pervasive that it affected defendant's right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The witness argued that Iowa's material witness statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 804.11, authorized only detention in order to ensure service of a subpoena and once service of a subpoena was ensured, the material witness could no longer be held in custody. The supreme court agreed. Material witness detention statutes were to be narrowly construed because of the liberty interests affected. The statute could be used after a criminal proceeding had been commenced against a third party but the location of a material witness was not presently known. After an arrest warrant had been issued, law enforcement officers had the authority to arrest the witness. The witness could then be held in custody, with bond if appropriate, until the witness was served with a subpoena in the underlying criminal action. The limiting language of Iowa Code &sect; 804.11 had to be given full effect and the material witness could be detained only so long as was necessary to serve a subpoena upon the witness. Once a subpoena to appear and testify was served on the witness, the authority to detain the witness pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 804.11 ended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Iowa, sought review of a decision of the Iowa District Court for Webster County, which entered an order reinstating appellee inmate's earned-time credits after finding a violation of the U.S. Const. amend. right against self-incrimination. The inmate was a convicted sex offender, and the State had revoked the earned-time credits under Iowa Code &sect; 903A.2(1)(a) (2007) after he failed to sign up for a treatment program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that if he enrolled in the sex offender treatment program (SOTP) then he would be admitting his guilt. The court overruled the decision. The court held that the inmate had every right not to be a witness against himself, which was a right he actually chose to waive at trial by taking the stand. However, once he had been convicted as a sex offender, the State of Iowa could constitutionally establish an incentive for him to obtain treatment in prison by withholding earned-time credits if he declines to participate. Thus, the court found no U.S. Const. amend. V. The requirement that the inmate participate in the SOTP to be eligible for earned-time credits was part of a fair criminal process. Iowa Code &sect; 903A.2(1)(a) (2007), which established this requirement, was the law both when the inmate was alleged to have sexually assaulted his victim and when he was convicted of doing so. Thus, from the moment the inmate committed his crime, it was clear that if he was convicted and chose not to participate in the prescribed treatment program, he would not be eligible for earned-time credits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was overruled and the earned-time credits were again revoked.</SPAN></P>

The Bank claimed that the plain language of &sect; 524.1406(3)(a) was unambiguous and that the phrase &quot;a transaction or event&quot; was an open-ended provision that applied not only to bank mergers, but to any kind of transaction that triggered appraisal rights under Iowa Code ch. 490, including reverse stock splits. The court of appeals disagreed. Based on the statutory context and legislative history of &sect; 524.1406(3)(a) the court held that the legislature did not intend to extend minority and lack of marketability discounts to the valuation of shares of a bank in a reverse stock split. Instead, &sect; 524.1406(3)(a) was intended to effectuate the extension of the discounts to bank holding companies.</SPAN></P>

The District Court for Des Moines County (Iowa) determined Iowa Code &sect; 657.1(2) authorized the utility to assert a comparative fault defense only against the farm's claim for future damages, if any, awarded in lieu of injunctive relief.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility argued, inter alia, the district court erred in interpreting Iowa Code &sect; 657.1(2) to allow the comparative fault defense in a nuisance action against an electric utility only against future damages awarded in lieu of injunctive relief. The supreme court agreed. The statute made this defense available in an action to abate a nuisance against an electric utility. A reading of &sect; 657.1 in proper context demonstrated a legislative intent to authorize a comparative fault defense in any nuisance action seeking damages against an electric utility under certain conditions. The supreme court concluded &sect; 657.1(2) allowed an electric utility to assert comparative fault to a claim for damages caused by nuisance if it established it complied with engineering and safety standards adopted by the utilities board and secured the permits and approvals as provided in the statute. However, the court also concluded that to avoid an unconstitutional taking, comparative fault principles could not be applied to reduce a plaintiff's recovery for the diminution in value of his or her property caused by the nuisance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a denial of postconviction relief entered by the Iowa District Court for Polk County following his conviction for kidnapping in the first degree under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 710.1 and 710.2, which offense was committed when appellant was 16. Appellant was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole under Iowa Code &sect; 902.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because kidnapping in the first degree was a class A felony, the mandatory sentence was life in prison without the possibility of parole. While the appeal did not raise any issues previously before the district court, the court construed the postconviction action as a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Iowa R. Crim. P. 2.24(5)(a) as appellant raised the issue that his sentence violated his constitutional right against cruel and unusual punishment. Based on the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Graham v. Florida, the clauses in Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 902.1 and 906.5 (2003) making appellant ineligible for parole were unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. VIII as applied to appellant because he was a juvenile convicted of a nonhomicide offense. Although appellant was convicted in 2005, the Graham decision applied retroactively to him because it was a new rule of substantive law clarifying the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 4.12, the unconstitutional portions of &sect;&sect; 902.1 and 906.5 were severable. Therefore, appellant was to be resentenced to life in prison but with the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Iowa Admin. Code r. 493-12.5 imposed a hard cap of $1,500 on attorney fees for the representation of indigent defendants and prevented an attorney from recovering additional fees even where extra time and effort was reasonable and necessary. An attorney represented two indigent defendants in their criminal appeals; based upon the amount of time he put into preparation of the briefs, he would receive only $12.27 and $12.56 per hour. He petitioned for a higher fee, but the state public defender rejected his petition, and the district court affirmed. On review, the court held that Iowa Code &sect; 13B.4(4)(a) did not authorize hard fee caps applicable in all cases; instead, in order to avoid constitutional difficulties, the court interpreted the term &quot;fee limitation&quot; to authorize only a range of hourly rates that might be charged, the procedure for making claims, and soft fee caps in categories of cases that could be rebutted by a showing of reasonable and necessity under Iowa Code &sect; 13B.4(4)(d)(6). As a result of this interpretation, the administrative rule establishing a hard fee cap of $1,500 for a criminal appeal violated the statute and could not be enforced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence allegedly derived from an unconstitutional stop and evidence purportedly obtained after law enforcement denied his right to call a family member, as guaranteed by Iowa Code &sect; 804.20 (2007). A jury found defendant guilty of operating while intoxicated, and the Iowa Court of Appeals affirmed. Defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa Supreme Court held that defendant was not afforded his &sect; 804.20 rights and therefore his motion to suppress should have been granted. An invocation did not turn on the grammatical clarity of the request, and law enforcement was not authorized to make discretionary decisions as to whether a detainee invoked the statutory right. Further, there was no need for law enforcement personnel to screen requests for good faith. Finally, once &sect; 804.20 was invoked, the detaining officer had to direct the detainee to the phone and invite the detainee to place his or her call or obtain the phone number from the detainee and place the phone call himself or herself. In the case as bar, defendant's articulated purpose for calling his mother (to come get him out) may have been futile, as found by the district court, but he wanted his mother's assistance and that was precisely the right contemplated by &sect; 804.20. The officer failed to provide a reasonable opportunity to make a phone call to a family member, as guaranteed by &sect; 804.20, because during processing he never directed defendant to a phone or attempted to make the call for him. Even if a phone was in reach, that alone did not suffice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the decision of the court of appeals, reversed the judgment of the district court, and remanded the case for a new trial, with instruction.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed. The ordinance created a rebuttable presumption that the parent failed to exercise reasonable parental control of the parent's minor(s) after a second occurrence, adjudication or the entry of an informal adjustment agreement related to any unlawful act, and prior notification to the parent of the parental responsibility ordinance including notice of possible fines or penalties. The supreme court found that allowing a fact finder to presume negligence and causation based on the happening of an &quot;occurrence,&quot; rather than finding negligence and causation based on the facts, was arbitrary and irrational. Accordingly, the supreme court held the provisions of the ordinance creating the presumption were arbitrary and irrational and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state employee sued defendants coemployees for personal injuries suffered as a result of coemployees' gross negligence in the course of their employment.

The State sought interlocutory review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued, inter alia, that a personal injury claim based on gross negligence brought by a state employee against coemployees was a common law action subject to the administrative provisions of the Iowa Tort Claims Act (ITCA), Iowa Code &sect; 669.14 (2009) and therefore the district court was without subject matter jurisdiction over the gross negligence claim against the coemployees because the state employee failed to exhaust the administrative procedures under the Act. The supreme court agreed. The claim brought by the state employee fell within the definition of a &quot;claim&quot; under the ITCA. The ITCA excepts claims &quot;covered&quot; by the Iowa workers' compensation law. Under Iowa Code &sect; 85.20(2), the workers' compensation laws were the exclusive remedy against coemployee claims provided the injury was &quot;not caused by the other employee's gross negligence.&quot; The workers' compensation laws clearly did not include coemployee gross negligence claims, and they did not deal with such claims. Instead, the workers' compensation laws did just the opposite. They excluded coemployee gross negligence claims from their coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's classification required him to attend SOTP. He argued that his simple assault conviction did not contain a sexual element and he refused to participate in SOTP. Under Iowa Code &sect; 903A.2(1)(a) (Supp. 2005), an inmate would not accrue any earned time after refusing to attend SOTP. The inmate alleged that the stopping of his ability to accrue earned time credit was improper. The court held that IDOC's requirement that the inmate participate in SOTP and the determination that his ability to accrue earned time be stopped did not violate the ex post facto clause and was statutorily authorized. The inmate was, however, deprived of due process because IDOC relied on unadmitted factual allegations in reaching the decision to require the inmate's participation in SOTP but did not provide the necessary procedural protections; specifically, advance written notice, a written statement of reasons and findings by the factfinder, and a neutral factfinder. The IDOC report did not explain whether the inmate's prior sex offense conviction alone justified participation in SOTP. Lastly, the decision to admit polygraph evidence at a classification hearing was left to IDOC's discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit to recover cable television franchise fees imposed by defendant city, plaintiff appealed summary judgment granted by the District Court for Dubuque County, Iowa, in favor of the city, arguing that the retroactive authorization of franchise fees in excess of the cost of regulation under Iowa Code &sect; 477A.7(5) violated his rights to substantive due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court ruled that franchise fees assessed by a city on gas and electrical power services constituted an illegal tax where such fees exceeded the reasonable costs of regulating the franchised activity. Following this rule, plaintiff filed suit against the city seeking to recover franchise fees that he paid. In response to numerous similar lawsuits, the state legislature enacted Iowa Code &sect; 477A.7(5), which ratified fees imposed and collected prior to its enactment. Based upon this retroactive legislation, the city moved for summary judgment. On review of summary judgment granted in favor of the city, the court held that the legislature's ratification of the city's unauthorized tax was a curative statute whose purpose--to safeguard the public fisc and the financial stability of local municipalities--was rationally related to its retroactivity. Therefore, the statute did not violate plaintiff's substantive due process rights, and the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Iowa District Court for Des Moines County, which granted the State's motion to voluntarily dismiss a criminal charge for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI) under Iowa Code &sect; 321J.2(1)(a) and (b) (2007). Defendant asserted that the dismissal was not in the furtherance of justice as it avoided a determination on the merits of his pending motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer observed defendant's vehicle in the street with defendant standing outside stumbling and urinating. Defendant was arrested and charged with OWI. The State conceded to a dismissal with prejudice because the officer that administered the blood alcohol test was not properly certified. The court noted that the exclusionary rule did not apply in the license revocation proceeding of Iowa Code &sect; 321J.13(6). The court reversed and held that to allow prosecutors to dismiss criminal cases while motions to suppress were pending in order ensure that &sect; 321J.13(6) was not triggered would have been to sanction a manipulation that was not &quot;in the furtherance of justice&quot; in light of the clear legislative direction. As a result, once a motion to suppress had been filed, dismissal under Iowa R. Crim. P. 2.33(1) would only be in the furtherance of justice if the State articulated grounds for dismissal independent of those raised in the motion to suppress. Because the State failed to show such independent grounds, the motion to dismiss should have been denied. Dismissal of the criminal charges against defendant, prior to the adjudication of his motion to suppress, therefore, was in error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the district court dismissing the case was reversed and the matter is remanded to the district court for an adjudication on the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sexual abuse after raping his female cousin both before and after she reached the age of 12. At trial, two of defendant's other cousins testified to prior sexual contact with defendant, each testifying that defendant had raped her and forced her to engage in oral and anal sex. The trial court ruled that such evidence was admissible under Iowa Code &sect; 701.11 because the legislature found it necessary to sexual abuse cases to make an exception to the general rule excluding the admission of prior bad acts evidence. On review, the court held that Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9, prohibited the admission of prior bad acts evidence based solely on general propensity. Although prior sexual abuse involving the same victim was admissible under Iowa Code &sect; 701.11 to show a passion or propensity for illicit sexual relations with the particular person at issue, the application of Iowa Code &sect; 701.11 violated the Due Process Clause of the Iowa Constitution in defendant's case because it permitted the admission of prior bad acts against an individual other than the victim in the case to demonstrate defendant's general propensity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Iowa Court of Appeals that affirmed his conviction of third-degree sexual abuse and the sentence imposed, arguing that his sentence of lifetime parole under Iowa Code &sect; 903B.1 (2007) violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws and that the sentencing court erred in precluding him from having any contact with anyone under the age of 18 without the permission of his probation officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of third-degree sexual abuse after engaging in an on-going sexual relationship with a teenage girl. On review of the sentence imposed, the court held that, because it was unclear whether defendant was convicted based upon conduct alleged to have occurred before or after the effective date of the statute authorizing lifetime parole, Iowa Code &sect; 903B.1 (2007), it had to assume that it was based upon pre-effective date conduct; as such, the statute was applied retroactively, and lifetime parole was imposed in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause, Iowa Const. art. 1, &sect; 21. Further, the no-contact condition of the defendant's probation was unnecessarily excessive. Given the circumstances of defendant's offense, it was reasonable for the trial court to restrict defendant's interaction with minors. However, the condition imposed literally prohibited any and all contact with any person under the age of 18 regardless of how unintended, incidental, or innocuous such contact might be unless the defendant has obtained permission from his supervising officer. Under the condition, defendant risked a probation violation by simply leaving his house.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The imposition of lifetime parole under Iowa Code &sect; 903B.1 was vacated for violating the Ex Post Facto Clause, Iowa Const. art. 1, &sect; 21, and the no-contact condition of defendant's probation was vacated as being unreasonable. To the extent the court of appeals reached contrary conclusions, its decision was vacated. The case was remanded to the district court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed an in rem forfeiture complaint. Appellant property owner filed a preanswer motion to dismiss but declined to file an answer. The district court granted forfeiture by default. The owner appealed. The court of appeals affirmed. The court granted further review, limiting consideration of the case to the constitutionality of Iowa Code &sect; 809A.13(3) (2007) as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his preanswer motion, the owner asserted that the in rem forfeiture was unconstitutional because the Iowa Code specifically prevented him from filing an answer in violation of due process. The district court did not rule on that issue but did specifically permit him to file an answer. On review, the court noted that the issue presented was whether &sect; 809A.13(3) could be construed to allow aggrieved property owners and interested parties to file an answer to a verified forfeiture complaint. The plain, straightforward language of &sect; 809A.13(3) prohibited a party from filing an answer where a timely claim had not been made.  The court concluded that &sect; 809A.13(3) could not be constitutionally applied in forfeiture proceedings commenced by verified petition. However, the district court did exactly what it should have done; afford the owner an opportunity to file an answer. It declined to apply the mandate of &sect; 809A.13(3) and it provided the owner with an opportunity to present an answer. The owner was therefore not denied due process and he could not use his choice to decline an opportunity to be heard to create a constitutional infirmity on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated in part and affirmed in part the opinion of the court of appeals, disagreeing with the court of appeals that Iowa Code &sect; 809A.13(3) (2007) should be interpreted as not applying to the instant case but affirming the ultimate conclusion affirming the grant of forfeiture by default. The court affirmed the district court judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The workers' compensation commissioner awarded death benefits to appellants, dependents of a deceased employee. The dependents sought review of the decision of the Iowa District Court for Polk County affirming the allocation of the benefits. On transfer, the Iowa Court of Appeals also affirmed. The Supreme Court of Iowa granted further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dependents included a spouse and their child, five children born in Mexico, and the children's mother who resided in Mexico. The court held that Iowa Code &sect; 85.31(5) did not violate equal protection of the law. The mother was eligible to receive benefits under &sect; 85.31(1), because she was a dependent and her children were eligible to receive benefits under &sect; 85.31(1)(b). The court also found that the commissioner erred when he apportioned the compensation. First, the worker's compensation statutes did not allow the mother to receive any compensation in an apportionment. Second, the amount of benefits payable to the Second Injury Fund should not have been considered when the commissioner apportioned the compensation to the nonresident aliens. Section 85.43 controlled the apportionment of the compensation payable because the employee left a surviving spouse and did not provide for any apportionment to an actual dependent. Therefore, even though the mother was eligible as an actual dependent to receive compensation, she was not entitled to receive any of the compensation awarded for the employee's death because &sect; 85.43 controlled who was to receive the compensation, not &sect; 85.44.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the decision of the appellate court, reversed the judgment of the district court, and remanded to the district court with directions to enter an order reversing the decision of the commissioner and remanding the case to the commissioner to reallocate the benefits between the dependents entitled to receive compensation in a manner consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 17 was not ripe for adjudication. Defendant had not served any time in prison, his sentence was suspended, and he was on probation. In addition, the imposition of lifetime parole was not tantamount to a sentence of life imprisonment. The terms of his parole and the extent to which those terms might have been onerous was unknown.

Under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 562A.8 and 562A.29A(2), a signed receipt was not required in FED actions. The FED statutory scheme deemed notice complete upon mailing. Because &sect; 562A.29A(2), read in conjunction with &sect; 562A.8 and the seven-day hearing requirement, did not require service which was reasonably calculated to reach the intended recipient, the means chosen to provide notice in this FED action violated the due process clause of the Iowa Constitution, Iowa Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fifteen-year-old victim engaged in a sexual relationship with the twenty-one-year-old defendant. Defendant was convicted of statutory rape. The maximum sentence for his offense without enhancement, was ten years; with various credits, his likely prison term would have been about four years. Defendant's sentence was enhanced based on a prior sexual offense committed when he was twelve-years-old. Under the enhanced sentencing scheme, the district court imposed a twenty-five year prison sentence. Defendant would have to serve at least 21.25 years in prison, a five hundred percent increase due to the enhancement. On appeal, defendant claimed that the twenty-five-year prison sentence amounted to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 17. Iowa R. Crim. P. 2.24(5)(a) permitted defendant to challenge the legality of his sentence at any time.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Iowa Court of Appeals that affirmed his conviction of child endangerment resulting in serious injury, arguing that the trial court erred in excluding statements that the child's mother made to a social worker as impermissible hearsay that did not meet the exception for statements against interest under Iowa R. Evid. 5.804(b)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the father of a baby who sustained injury and was diagnosed with shaken baby syndrome. At the relevant time period in question, the child was in the sole care of his mother and defendant. Prior to trial, the State moved to exclude the testimony of a social worker regarding statements made by the child's mother, and the circuit court granted the motion. On review, the court held that the statements were admissible as statements against penal interest under Iowa R. Evid. 5.804(b)(3). The mother stated that defendant had not been the one who harmed the child; by making statements that exculpated defendant, the mother indirectly implicated herself as the person who caused the injuries. In addition, the mother made statements that were directly inculpatory. She stated that she yelled at the baby when he cried and had recently started spanking the baby for crying but claimed that she did not hurt him since he wore a diaper. Yelling at the baby showed an obvious lack of self-control, and spanking a two-month-old infant for crying was an admission of inappropriate behavior that could give rise to an inference that the mother was the person who injured the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being released on parole, the sex offender moved into his parents' home. When it was discovered, however, that his parents lived within 2000 feet of an elementary school, the sex offender was served with notice that his living arrangement violated Iowa Code &sect; 692A.2A, and he was given five days to move. The sex offender filed a suit challenging the 2000-foot rule. On review of the judgment of dismissal, the court held that the statute did not infringe upon the sex offender's right to travel because it did not it did not prevent him from entering or leaving any part of the state but only prevented him from residing near a school or child care facility. In addition, the statute was not impermissibly vague because it defined a sex offender's residence as that place where a person sleeps, and it was not impermissibly overbroad because it did not preclude the sex offender even from attending events with restricted areas, just from residing therein. Further, the statute did not constitute a bill of attainder or an ex post facto law because the residency restrictions did not constitute punishment and those subject to the restrictions had been afforded due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The workers' compensation commissioner awarded appellee employee benefits for three separate injury dates, and the Iowa District Court for Polk County not only affirmed the decision of the agency but also found the employer and its insurance carrier were not entitled to a credit for benefits paid by a group plan under Iowa Code &sect; 85.38(2) (2005). Appellants, the employer and its insurance carrier sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it did not violate due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to find that the employee suffered a low back injury on September 14, 2004 because, at the April 2006 hearing, the employer had notice and an opportunity to defend the claim. The employee filed an incident report and told physicians that her injury occurred around 8 a.m. on September 14 and was from repetitive use of a vacuum and lifting more than 20 pounds of trash. In November 2004 the doctor sent the employer a copy of the report. The court also held that: (1) despite conflicting evidence, substantial evidence supported findings in favor of an employee because the agency found the employee to be a credible witness; (2) the agency miscalculated the period of overlap for the first two injuries; (3) the commissioner properly declined to apportion benefits for the second and third injuries because permanent total disability benefits were not subject to apportionment under Iowa Code &sect; 85.34(7) (2005); and (4) the district court should not have considered a credit-for-benefits issue because the agency did not rule on it and therefore the employer was not aggrieved or adversely affected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the part of the judgment dealing with the apportionment of benefits for the first two injuries and vacated the part of the judgment dealing with the credit-for-benefits issue. The court otherwise affirmed the decision affirming the judgment of the workers' compensation commissioner. The court remanded the case to the district court to enter judgment and then to remand the matter to the agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the SVP was serving three indeterminate sentences not to exceed 25 years following his convictions of second-degree sexual abuse, the State petitioned for the civil commitment of the SVP, who moved for postconviction release, contending that his sentence had expired. The SVP contested the State's petition by arguing that he was not &quot;presently confined&quot; because he should have been released under the applicable law before the State filed its petition. The district court accepted the SVP's argument, held that he should have been released previously, and dismissed the State's petition as untimely. On review, the court held that the SVP was presently confined under Iowa Code &sect; 229A.4(1) (2007) when the State filed its petition because the SVP had continuously been in the custody of the Department of Corrections and the State never relied upon any legal basis to justify his custody other than his sexual abuse conviction. Although the SVP's term of incarceration would have expired if his sentence had been reduced according to the applicable law, he was still confined, with no claim of bad faith, due to the sexual abuse convictions when the State filed its petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's dismissal of the petition for civil commitment was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings as required by the Sexually Violent Predator Act, Iowa Code ch. 229A (2007).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city asserted that its issuance of the moratorium was a legislative function, and therefore, it was not reviewable by a writ of certiorari because certiorari review was only available when the lower tribunal was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. The court agreed that the city's adoption of a moratorium was a legislative function and, therefore, not reviewable. However, the court concluded that the district court applied incorrect law in determining whether the city illegally denied the developer's site plan and failed to consider whether the change in zoning was done in bad faith. An improper purpose existed when a zoning authority adopted a new zoning regulation designed to frustrate a particular applicant's plans for development. The district court erred in relying on the pending ordinance rule. The court remanded the issue of bad faith to the district court to determine whether the city illegally denied the site plan and whether an improper purpose existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the trial court found that defendant was not guilty of a criminal charge. The trial court subsequently entered post-acquittal orders requiring defendant to reimburse the State of Iowa, pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 815.9 (2005), for the cost of legal assistance provided at public expense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was indigent, challenged the requirement for him to reimburse the State of Iowa for the cost of legal assistance provided at public expense. On appeal, the court found that the trial court's failure to consider defendant's ability to reimburse the State for the costs of his defense infringed his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In addition, defendant's right to equal protection was violated in two ways: (1) the court-ordered repayment plan effectively deprived defendant of the statutory exemptions from execution on civil judgments that were available to other civil judgment debtors; and (2) Iowa Code ch. 815 restricted the restitution obligation of a convicted defendant represented by a public defender to a statutory fee, but not the repayment or restitution obligation of all other indigent defendants, including acquitted defendants such as defendant. In addition, the trial court erroneously included the statutory court reporter fee in the sum defendant was required to repay. However, there was no due-process violation under the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the intermediate appellate court was vacated, the judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings. Upon remand, any repayment ordered by the court was to limit attorney fees to the statutory fee, was not to include statutory court reporter fees, and was not to require payments that would have deprived defendant of the protections accorded other civil judgment debtors.</SPAN></P>

On review of the district court ruling that the statute violated equal protection rights, the court concluded that excluding gay and lesbian people from civil marriage was not substantially related to any important governmental objective. The court held that legislative classifications based on sexual orientation had to be examined under a heightened level of scrutiny under the Iowa Constitution. The court had a constitutional duty to ensure equal protection of the law and faithfulness to that duty required a conclusion that Iowa Code &sect; 595.2 violated the Iowa Constitution; if gay and lesbian people were required to submit to different treatment without an exceedingly persuasive justification, they were deprived of the benefits of the principle of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

An amendment in 2005 provided that a sex offender, such as the inmate, was not eligible for a reduction in sentence unless the inmate completed a sex offender treatment program; the inmate was removed from such a program due to misconduct. The inmate brought a motion for postconviction relief after his release date was extended almost four months due to the application of the amendments. The writ of certiorari was annulled as the amendment, as applied to the inmate, violated both U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 21. Section 903A.2, as amended, operated retrospectively as it applied to inmates convicted for acts committed before the provision's effective date. The punishment for the inmate's crime was made more onerous because if the inmate did not participate in the sex offender treatment program but otherwise behaved, he would have a longer period of incarceration under the amended statute than under the version in effect at the time of his sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court disagreed. Under a rational-basis standard, there was a reasonable fit between protecting children from sex crimes and limiting contact between children and sex offenders by prohibiting an unmarried parent from living with a person the parent knew to be a sex offender. The disparate treatment of married and cohabiting individuals was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary. The objective of the statute was to protect children from sex crimes by limiting contact with registered sex offenders who were neither a parent nor stepparent. The legislature could rationally make that classification because it was realistically conceivable that unmarried cohabitating sex offenders did not have the same stake in the children's financial and physical well-being, and therefore posed a greater threat to the children. Error was not preserved on defendant's due process claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a ruling from the District Court for Johnson County (Iowa), which, after convicting defendant of indecent exposure under Iowa Code &sect; 709.9 pursuant to defendant's guilty plea, ruled that the special sentencing provisions of Iowa Code &sect; 903B.2 providing for a 10-year parole period were illegal and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted several challenges to the statute. The court held that the special sentence imposed under &sect; 903B.2 was not grossly disproportionate to the acts of committing the crime of indecent exposure and subsequently violating parole terms; thus, it was not cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Because all sex offenders were similarly situated and the legislature could rationally determine that imposing a special sentence on sex offenders for parole violations advanced the State's strong interest in protecting citizens from sex crimes, the statute did not violate equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 6. A parole violation ruling under &sect; 903B.2 was an executive or administrative decision and did not involve sentencing functions; hence, there was no violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine under Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 1. In accordance with Iowa Code &sect; 4.7, the specific provisions of &sect; 903B.2 prevailed over the more general provisions of Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 903.1(b), 906.15 regarding the length of incarceration and parole for a misdemeanor, and &sect; 903B.2 therefore did not impose an illegal sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the district court's holding that the special sentence was illegal and unconstitutional, and the court remanded with instructions that the special sentence be imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Iowa Admin. Code r. 701--71.1(4), (5) (2005) classified apartment buildings as commercial property, regardless of their use, but classified condominiums as commercial if used for a commercial venture and residential if used for human habitation. The owners sought to have their apartment buildings taxed as residential because residential properties were taxed at a much lower percentage of their assessed value than commercial properties. The owners argued that the disparate treatment afforded apartments and condominiums under the rule was a violation of the equal protection because condominiums leased for human habitation were classified as residential, while apartments leased for human habitation were classified as commercial. The court ruled that any similarities between apartments and condominiums were insufficient to consider them similarly situated for equal protection analysis. A condominium was typically occupied by the owner whereas an apartment was always a commercial enterprise. The primary use of each was dissimilar. One was typically residential whereas the other was exclusively commercial. As a result, apartments were not similarly situated to condominiums.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that Carter Lake, Iowa, Municipal Ordinance 55.12(cc) was not so vague as to violate due process, and therefore the evidence of intoxication was not the fruit of an unlawful stop, because a person of ordinary understanding would know that turning up the volume of a car radio so that it could be heard 100 feet away was far louder than needed to be heard by car occupants and would expose the operator to a citation. The court further held that a defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel due to counsel's failure to ensure compliance with the jury trial waiver provisions of Iowa R. Crim. P. 2.17(1) had to show not only that counsel breached an essential duty but must also show actual prejudice, contrary to a prior holding in the Stallings case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to one count of second degree sexual abuse,  four counts of third degree sexual abuse, and one count of incest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended the sentencing court's application of Iowa Code &sect; 902.12 did not result in an illegal sentence.

The mandatory minimum sentence requirement of &sect; 902.12 applied only to acts of sexual abuse committed after that date. The guilty plea and the resulting sentence conformed completely with the parties' plea agreement. This conclusion was supported by the fact that defendant did not challenge the legality of the sentence until he filed an application for postconviction relief more than two years later.

On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the statute was a bill of attainder. A bill of attainder inflicted punishment without a judicial trial. Merely being subject to residency restrictions was not punishment, and defendant was afforded all of the protections of the judicial process when he was charged with violating the statute. Further, the court rejected defendant's equal protection claim because there was a reasonable fit between the government interest of public safety and the means utilized to advance that interest by precluding persons convicted of molesting children from residing within 2,000 feet of a school or day care center. The court likewise rejected defendant's argument that he was entitled to a hearing to determine whether he was dangerous before being subjected to the residency restrictions because no such hearing was mentioned in the statute and due process did not entitle a person to a hearing to establish a fact that was not material under the law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was insufficient evidence that defendant's exposure of his genitals to the officer was for the purpose of arousing or satisfying the sexual desires of himself or the officer. It was not sufficient that prior to the exposure defendant sought to satisfy his sexual desires. There were no facts indicating that defendant's exposure of his penis to the officer was anything other than inadvertent, occurring as a result of defendant turning in response to the officer's call. Defendant immediately removed his hand from his crotch and fled. Those actions suggested that his sexual desires evaporated, rather than continued, when he was discovered. Finally, there was no evidence that he became sexually aroused when he turned to face the officer or that he masturbated while exposing himself to the officer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the decision of the court of appeals, reversed the judgment of conviction, and remanded the case for dismissal of the indecent exposure charge.</SPAN></P>

The Iowa District Court for Hardin County held the findings by the agency were supported by substantial evidence. The caretaker appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the caretaker contended the evidence did not support the conclusion that she consented to sexual conduct; and Iowa Code &sect; 235B.2(5)(a)(3) was facially unconstitutional. The supreme court found that the evidence was sufficient to find that the caretaker willingly engaged in consensual sexual conduct with the resident for the purpose of arousing or satisfying the sexual desires of either of them. While the caretaker testified otherwise, a reasonable fact finder could have concluded that she consented to the touching by the resident and removed his hand from her inner thigh and voiced opposition to the presence of his hand on her body only when the conduct was detected by others. The caretaker permitted the resident, a wheelchair-bound dependent adult, to touch an area of her body in a sexual manner by sitting in a chair in such a way that allowed the touching to take place; this amounted to sexual conduct without the need to further show touching by the caretaker. As the caretaker did not challenge the statute as applied to her, she did not have standing to challenge the facial constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pharmacist argued that Iowa Code &sect; 155A.3(35)(c) did not vest the Board with the authority to designate as a &quot;prescription drug&quot; a compounded substance consisting of a combination of nonprescription substances. The supreme court found that the Board's interpretation of &sect; 155A.3(35)(c) as a statutory authorization to identify prescription drugs by administrative rule was not irrational, illogical, or wholly unjustifiable. It gave reasonable and logical meaning to the words &quot;or regulation&quot; in the statute. There was no limitation in Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 124.203--.212 on the Board's authority to define &quot;prescription drugs.&quot; Iowa Admin. Code r. 657--20.2 was not rendered invalid as a consequence of the Board's failure to require a prescription for the dispensing by pharmacists of &quot;over-the-counter&quot; drugs manufactured by others. Because he failed to demonstrate dissimilar treatment of similarly situated individuals, the pharmacist's equal protection challenge to the Board's rule was without merit. The Board found that the pharmacist engaged in a patter of choosing which rules to follow and which to ignore. The pharmacist's serial violations warranted the imposition of a three-year probation.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed, finding first that the citizen's claim of injury lacked any immediacy to support standing to raise a constitutional claim. Her prior status as a worker who had suffered a prior work-related injury did not make it any more likely that she would suffer another injury in the future. The absence of an allegation or claim by the citizen that implicated fraud, surprise, personal and private gain, or other such evils inconsistent with the democratic legislative process diminished the supreme court's need to intervene to determine if the legislature violated a constitutional mandate; the absence of a claimed violation of the title requirement also diminished the importance of the constitutional issue presented. The citizen failed to present an issue of such great public importance to require the supreme court to waive the requirement of standing.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that assuming survival of the Tribe was a compelling state interest, the preferred placement provisions under the Iowa ICWA, as they applied to voluntary termination of parental rights, violated due process as they were not narrowly tailored. The statute made the rights of the Tribe paramount to the rights of the mother; the State had no right to influence the mother's decision by preventing her from choosing a family she felt was best suited to raise her child. However, the juvenile court failed to make the required findings supporting good cause to deviate from the federal placement preferences. The Tribe should have been permitted to represent itself in the ICWA proceedings, and a non-lawyer tribal member could have represented the Tribe as long as the representative was authorized to speak on the Tribe's behalf.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty as charged. The court of appeals found there was not substantial evidence to support an enticement conviction. The court of appeals reversed defendant's conviction with instructions to enter a finding of guilt for attempted enticement. The reviewing court ruled that because the crime of enticement required the victim to be enticed away, defendant was guilty of attempted enticement. The phrase &quot;entices away&quot; required the fact finder to look not only to the actions and conduct of defendant, but also to the impact of those actions upon the victim. A perpetrator entices, but it was the victim who was enticed away. While defendant had the requisite intent, he failed to lure or tempt away a minor or someone reasonably believed to be a minor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee teacher sued appellant school district, alleging that the district violated the prohibition on age discrimination in the Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA) when it denied her application for early retirement incentives on the basis that she did not meet the plan's minimum age requirement. The Iowa District Court for Scott County denied motions for summary judgment by both parties, and the district brought an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To be eligible for the district's early retirement plan, an employee had to reach age 55 by June 30. The birthday of the teacher challenging the plan was in September, which would have made her eligible if the district had used the same qualification date as the previous year. The reviewing court held that the district's motion for summary judgment should have been granted. While the ICRA made it generally unlawful to discriminate against an employee because of age, it provided, in Iowa Code &sect; 216.13, a specific exception for retirement plans, and the district's early retirement incentive plan fell squarely within that exclusion. There was no evidence to suggest the school district acted with age-related animus toward the teacher or that she was being singled out. Further, the district provided a legitimate reason for setting the minimum age requirement, financial savings. The plan allowed the district to pay early retirement incentives out of management levy funds, freeing up more money in the school districts' general funds for other needs, if the employees receiving the funds were between the ages of 55 and 65 at the time of  retirement.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a previous case upholding the city's authority to require the company to place wires underground in a different location did not result in issue preclusion because the previous case did not address the issue of whether the company could recover the cost from its customers. The tariff did not infringe upon the city's right under Iowa Code &sect; 364.2(4)(e) to regulate the conditions required and the manner of use of its streets and public grounds because the company's cost recovery did not affect the city's exercise of control over its right-of-way. Moreover, because the IUB had exclusive authority under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 476.1, 476.2(1) to regulate utility rates, Iowa Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant rental property owner sought review of a judgment from the Iowa Court of Appeals, which affirmed the dismissal on summary judgment of the owner's suit challenging appellee city's antidiscrimination ordinance, Iowa City City Code &sect; 2-3-1. The owner sought declaratory relief, damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, a writ of certiorari on the ground of an unlawful administrative proceeding, and a stay of the administrative proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner employed a resident manager for his rental property. An unsuccessful applicant filed a discrimination complaint. After a settlement, the discrimination complaint was dismissed with prejudice. The court held that the claims relating to the administrative proceeding were moot because no practical relief could be had under Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.1411. The trial court erred in dismissing the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim as moot, however, because the settlement did not encompass the owner's claim that the city had violated his civil rights. The declaratory claim also remained viable after dismissal of the administrative proceeding because the owner was still constrained by the ordinance's restrictions and therefore had a specific personal interest in its validity. The court held that the ordinance conflicted with state law and was invalid under Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 38A and Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 364.1, 364.2(3) insofar as it purported to apply to all employers because such application conflicted with the small business exception in Iowa Code &sect; 216.6. Although Iowa Code &sect; 216.19 did not authorize broadening the class of employers, it allowed a prohibition against marital status discrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment as to the declaratory relief and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims, affirmed the summary judgment as to the remaining counts, and remanded to the district court for entry of a judgment declaring the employment discrimination ordinance unconstitutional in its application to employers having fewer than four employees and for further proceedings on the &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank challenged a Iowa District Court for Black Hawk County order eliminating the bank's tax lien on property to which appellee city obtained title under Iowa Code &sect; 657A.10A (2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought ownership of abandoned property to which the bank had purchased a tax sale certificate at a county public bidder sale. The bank raised three issues on appeal: (1) whether the legislature intended Iowa Code &sect; 657A.10A(5) to override the lien created by Iowa Code &sect; 445.28; (2) whether Iowa Code &sect; 657A.10A(5) applied to tax liens created before its effective date; and (3) whether Iowa Code &sect; 657A.10A was constitutional under the Iowa Constitution. The appellate court was precluded from deciding the constitutional issue. The appellate court noted that Iowa Code &sect; 657A.10A(5) clearly mandated that if a court awarded title of the property to the city, title to the property was free and clear of any claims, liens, or encumbrances. The appellate court found the legislature intended &sect; 657A.10A(5) to override the lien created by &sect; 445.28. The passage of &sect; 657A.10A(5) had the effect of shortening the time for the bank to exercise its option. Section 657A.10A(5) was not a substantive statute, and Iowa Code &sect; 657A.10A fit squarely within the three-part test for retrospective application. Therefore, &sect; 657A.10A(5) applied to tax liens created before its effective date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The magistrate who issued the warrant, in his capacity as a private attorney, was simultaneously representing a putative father against one of the targets of the search in a child custody proceeding. The supreme court held that the magistrate was not neutral and detached, as required by the Fourth Amendment and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 8. A successful search of the home for evidence of drug offenses could have made the position of the warrant's target more difficult in the child custody matter and advanced the position of the magistrate's client. There was therefore a clear nexus between the magistrate's private representation and his official action in the instant case. Therefore, the magistrate had a nonpecuniary personal interest in the matter that objectively cast doubt on his ability to hold the balance between the state and the accused. No showing of actual prejudice was required. Harmless error analysis did not apply.</SPAN></P>

Summary judgment was granted to the providers on the basis of the statute of limitations in Iowa Code &sect; 614.1(9) (2001), and this appeal followed. In reversing, the supreme court determined that the limitations period did not begin to run in 1997 when the patient discovered the lump in her breast. The supreme court looked to other jurisdictions in determining that the injury was the development of the problem into a more serious condition that posed a greater danger to the patient or which required more extensive treatment. The inquiries of what constituted the injury, its cause, and when the patient was charged with knowledge of such, were highly fact-specific.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a child in need of assistance petition regarding the parents' children.

As both parents were incarcerated, they did not object to the adjudication of the children as children in need of assistance or the placement of the children in foster care. However, they sought a transfer of the case during termination proceedings. The transfer request was granted, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that Iowa Code &sect; 232B.5(10) had no time limitation, and only the causes listed in Iowa Code &sect; 232B.5(13) constituted good cause to deny a request for a transfer to a tribal court. The Iowa Legislature chose not to adopt a federal guideline dealing with the transfer of a transfer request when the Iowa Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) was enacted. Next, the transfer was in the best interest of the children under Iowa Code &sect; 232B.3(2). Further, there was no undue hardship under Iowa Code &sect; 232B.5(13)(c).

Defendant did not testify that he had never committed any crimes. Under the circumstances, additional cross-examination with evidence of prior drug convictions was beyond the scope of direct examination. The prior drug convictions were inadmissible under Iowa R. Evid. 5.609(b). However, the conviction was clearly based on overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. Defendant was positively identified as the bank robber by the bank teller, and two witnesses positively identified him as driving the getaway car during his circuitous escape from the bank. Money from the bank was also found in the car. Defendant admitted to a witness that he committed the robbery. Additionally, he failed to produce any witness to corroborate his alibi defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Iowa was called upon to determine whether Iowa Code &sect; 907.14(1) (2005), which provided for a civil money penalty as a result of a deferred judgment, was constitutional. Defendants argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, because it did not expressly contain a limit on the amount of penalty assessed. They further alleged that the provision violated due process of law by imposing punishment prior to an adjudication of guilt. The district court found the statutory provision void for vagueness and refused to enforce it. The Supreme Court of Iowa held the statute satisfied due process. Because the criminal law sanction for first offense OWI included a $1000 fine, there was no problem of fair notice. The provisions of Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 902.9, 903.1 created a ceiling for civil penalties that could be imposed when judgments were deferred. By restricting the range of sentencing options, the due process attack related to the potential of arbitrary enforcement was eliminated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of lascivious acts with a child. Later, the State charged him with violating the residency restriction contained in Iowa Code &sect; 692A.2A, alleging he lived within 2000 feet of a school. The Iowa District Court for Polk County granted defendant's motion to dismiss the trial information, finding that &sect; 692A.2A (2005) violated his due process rights. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State challenged the district court ruling that Iowa Code &sect; 692A.2A (2005) violated defendant's substantive due process rights. The supreme court found that the only right defendant raised in the appeal was the same right discussed by the district court in its opinion, the right to reside somewhere that met basic 21st century living standards. The supreme court held that the right to reside somewhere that met basic 21st century living standards was no different from the right to choose where and under what conditions one lived. Thus, the right defendant asserted in his brief was not a fundamental right. For &sect; 692A.2A to withstand defendant's constitutional challenge, there only had to be a reasonable fit between the government interest and the means utilized to advance that interest. But defendant chose not to present any evidence regarding the impact the statute had on him. Without such evidence, the supreme court was unable to determine whether the statute precluded him from residing somewhere that met basic 21st century living standards. As such, defendant failed to establish the statute did not rationally advance some legitimate government purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a child-in-need-of-assistance proceeding, the Iowa District Court for Woodbury County authorized appellee Indian tribe to intervene on the ground that appellant children were &quot;Indian children&quot; as defined in the Iowa Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), Iowa Code &sect; 232B.3(6). On appeal, appellants county attorney and guardian ad litem for the children challenged the constitutionality of the Iowa ICWA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa ICWA, Iowa Code &sect; 232B.3(6), included in the definition of an &quot;Indian child&quot; a child under 18 years of age that an Indian tribe identified as a child of the tribe's community. Thus, &sect; 232B.3(6) purported to include children without regard to whether they were members of a tribe or eligible for membership. The supreme court held that, given the limits of governmental authority to legislate only in favor of members of federally recognized tribes, the Iowa ICWA's expansion of the definition of &quot;Indian child&quot; to include ethnic Indians not eligible for membership in a such a tribe constituted a racial classification. This classification could not survive strict scrutiny because it was not narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest. The state's interest in exercising the federal trust authority to protect &quot;essential tribal relations&quot; was a compelling one; however, the inclusion of merely &quot;ethnic&quot; Indian children extended beyond the boundary of the federal trust authority. Thus, &sect; 232B.3(6), as applied in the case at hand, violated the U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and the equality provision in article I, section 6 of the Iowa Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a patient committed to the Civil Commitment Unit for Sexual Offenders (CCUSO), appealed a ruling from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, arguing that the district court erred in denying his petition for judicial review. He claimed that he met the definition of an &quot;aggrieved person&quot; under Iowa Code ch. 17A (2003) and that to deny him a contested case hearing violated his due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was the subject of four behavioral reports for rule violations, was not an aggrieved person under ch. 17A and to deny him a contested case hearing did not violate his due process rights. The CCUSO developed a handbook that provided rules and policies, created patient rights, explained the five phases of the treatment program, and established a grievance procedure for behavioral violations. The failure of a patient to progress because of the issuance of a major behavioral report was not an adverse agency action, but an integral part of the treatment under a cognitive-behavioral model. Thus, appellant was not an aggrieved person for purposes of contested case review under Iowa Admin. Code r. 441-7.1(9). The CCUSO handbook did not create a minimum or maximum time frame for release from the treatment program but merely set forth behaviors appellant had to achieve so he could graduate from the program. Under the factors set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Mathews v. Eldridge, no additional process, beyond what was provided, was needed to satisfy appellant's procedural due process rights under the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an effort to stem the flow of college students into residential areas, the city passed a zoning ordinance that permitted only single-family dwellings in certain areas. Under Ames, Iowa, Mun. Code &sect; 29.201(62), a &quot;family&quot; was any number of related persons or no more than three unrelated persons. The association brought an action against the city, claiming that &sect; 29.201(62) violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The trial court awarded summary judgment to the city. On appeal, the court found that the United States Supreme Court had examined a more restrictive ordinance and held that it did not violate the United States Constitution. Hence, the city's ordinance did not violate the United States Constitution. Further, the ordinance did not violate Iowa Const. art. 1, &sect; 6. By limiting the number of unrelated persons who might live together, the ordinance furthered the city's goal of creating family-oriented neighborhoods that were safe and quiet for young children. It was also reasonable to conclude that density would be lessened by the ordinance. The relationship between the ordinance and the city's goals was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance began proceedings under Iowa Code ch. 453B (1997) to collect drug taxes based on defendant's possession of marijuana plants observed during an administrative search. Though the criminal charges against defendant were dismissed, the department obtained another search warrant and discovered the marijuana plants that provided the basis for defendant's conviction. On review, the supreme court found that the search was invalid. Iowa Code &sect; 808.14 required administrative search warrants to be issued in accordance with the statutory and common law requirements for the issuance of such warrants. The Fourth Amendment required reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an inspection to be satisfied before an administrative search could be conducted. The problem was Iowa Code &sect; 453B.9 made all drug tax assessments jeopardy assessments, and the warrant authorizing the search of defendant's home was issued without a showing of jeopardy or any reasonable legislative or administrative protections being in place. Thus, the search violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, and its fruits had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business had complied with Iowa Code &sect; 537.5111 by mailing the notice to the address on the disclosure statement, rather than the address on the individual's check. The magistrate and district court had necessarily rejected her testimony that she orally told the business that the check address was her current residence and there was no testimony that she later notified the business of a different address. Providing the business with a check that contained a different address was not sufficient under the circumstances to comply with Iowa Code &sect; 537.1201(4). The claim that the interest rate on the disclosure statement was deceptive and misleading failed as the interest rate notice and limitations provisions of the Iowa Delayed Deposit Services Licensing Act governed the transaction and its provisions were met. Iowa Code &sect; 533D.9 complied with Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 1 as it created protections for consumers and imposed limits on delayed deposit services.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) Bureau cited appellant employer for violations of IOSH standards. An administrative law judge (ALJ) dismissed certain violations. Appellee Employment Appeal Board (Board) reinstated most of the violations. The district court reinstated the ALJ's assessment. The Iowa Court of Appeals dismissed most of the violations. The Board and appellee Labor Commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two people died and five people were injured in a sewer-relining accident. Under Iowa Code &sect; 17A.19 (2001), the supreme court upheld the Board's decision that the employer violated IOSH standards. The Board properly determined that the general industry permit-required confined spaces standards applied to the sewer-relining project because substantial evidence supported the finding that the work done was maintenance. The application of these standards did not violate the Due Process Clauses of Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, &sect; 1, because the employer had fair warning and was on notice that these standards applied to the project, given the employer's policies and permits. Substantial evidence supported the Board's decision that the employer committed eight serious violations and 10 willful violations under Iowa Code &sect; 88.14 because, inter alia, proof of knowledge was not required to establish a violation was willful and ventilation equipment, air monitors, personal protection equipment, and a proper ladder were not present or properly used throughout the time the employees were working on the sewer. The Board did not err in failing to combine the penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated the appellate court's decision, reversed the district court's judgment, and remanded the case to the district court to enter an order affirming the Board's decision.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the suit was not timely filed under Iowa Code &sect; 670.5. The time for filing suit under Iowa Code ch. 670 was two years after timely notice of the claim had been given. Notice of the student's injury was given to the district on April 19, 2002, and suit was filed on August 12, 2004. More than two years had elapsed between the notice and the filing of the suit. The case was not rendered timely by the tolling provision of Iowa Code &sect; 614.8(2). The court, which had previously found part of Iowa Code &sect; 670.5 to be unconstitutional, rejected the father's argument that the statute was void in its entirety. The two-year limitation from notice of the claim was still valid. Because the suit was filed beyond the two-year limitation of &sect; 670.5, it was barred.</SPAN></P>

The trial court disagreed because it determined that the girlfriend's consent was voluntary. On appeal, the court held that the girlfriend's consent to the search was voluntary because: (1) she and the officer knew each other; (2) she was informed of her boyfriend's arrest; (3) she signed the consent form at her kitchen table; (4) the girlfriend's contemporaneous reaction was to lead the officers upstairs to perform the search; and (5) when the girlfriend signed the form there was no indication that she was going to be arrested. The court further held that the girlfriend's consent and the evidence seized as a result was not an exploitation of the prior illegal entry into the garage and defendant's illegal arrest as there was sufficient attenuation between the events.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A magistrate found defendant guilty of harassment of a public officer, a violation of Iowa Code &sect; 718.4 (2003). On appeal, the Iowa District Court for Cedar County, sitting as an appeals court, affirmed the conviction finding the statute criminalized conduct rather than speech, there was substantial evidence to support defendant's conviction, and the court imposed a harsher sentence than that imposed by the magistrate. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant claimed &sect; 718.4 was unconstitutional and there was not substantial evidence to support his conviction. The Supreme Court of Iowa held &sect; 718.4 was constitutional and there was substantial evidence to support the conviction. Section 718.4 gave fair warning that a person should not willfully hinder or attempt to hinder an officer from conducting a lawful investigation. Defendant should have known that intentionally entering the personal space of an officer would hinder him from completing a lawful investigation. Consequently, &sect; 718.4 was not vague as applied to defendant, who entered the personal space of the officer in a threatening manner while the officer was conducting a lawful investigation. Defendant further asserted that it was impermissible for the district court to have increased his sentence following his unsuccessful non-de novo appeal. The supreme court agreed and held that the imposition of a harsher sentence violated defendant's due process rights. In the instant case, the district court did not reconsider the evidence, make its own findings of fact, or provide defendant with logical non-vindictive reasons for imposing a harsher sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed, the sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded with directions to the district court to enter judgment for the same sentence as that imposed by the magistrate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city challenged the use of federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) instruction and the standards; and stipulated that it did not comply with the duties created by the IOSHA standards, but claimed it was not required to comply with any duties under the standards because it was not a &quot;host employer&quot; under 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1910.146. On review, the court held that the commissioner's use of the federal OSHA instruction and the standard interpretation did not amount to unlawful rulemaking in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 17A.3. because the commissioner adopted the standards of 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1910.146(c) using the required rulemaking procedures, and those standards were properly indexed in Iowa Admin.

The court also found that the board was correct in its interpretation of the general industry permit-required confined spaces standards under 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1910.146; and that substantial evidence supported the board's conclusion that those confined spaces standards were applicable to the sewer project, and that the city committed two serious violations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardians ad litem, advocating on behalf of defendant county, conceded that there was no statutory authority for payment of their fees by the state public defender. They argued, however, that the parents they represented were constitutionally entitled to guardians ad litem, and therefore, the state was obligated to pay the guardians. Upon review, the court concluded that there was no statutory or constitutional basis to order the guardians' fees paid from the indigent defense fund. The burden was on the guardians ad litem to demonstrate a constitutional infirmity in the manner in which constitutionally required guardians ad litem were compensated. The court found that they failed to meet their burden. In addition, the court determined that the 1999 amendments to Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 232.141(3)(c) and 815.7, eliminating the state public defender's obligation to pay such guardians ad litem, did not violate parents' equal protection or due process rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city, acting under authority of its nuisance-abatement ordinances, seized 12 vehicles from appellant property owners' land. The owners challenged the seizure through an action seeking temporary and permanent injunctions and damages. The Iowa District Court for Dallas County denied the injunction and granted the city's partial motion for summary judgment. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the property owners contended Perry, Iowa, Ordinance &sect; 50.05 was unconstitutional because it placed sole discretion over nuisance abatement in an administrative officer, without providing for a due-process hearing. The supreme court found that Perry, Iowa, Ordinance ch. 51, the ordinance describing junk vehicles, was so broad that it failed to give any meaningful notice as to what could be seized or what limits were imposed on the powers of the enforcement officer. Moreover, there was no evidence that the vehicles were palpably and indisputably nuisances or that there was any evidence of an emergency situation. As such, the supreme court held that the ordinance under which the owners' vehicles were seized denied the owners their procedural due process rights. However, Perry, Iowa, Ordinance &sect; 50.05 was not invalid on its face as it did not require the enforcement officer to seize vehicles without a hearing; it only authorized the officer to determine whether to utilize the nuisance abatement procedure or to issue a citation. Thus, the enforcement officer could follow either alternative by providing a notice and hearing and thereby avoiding constitutional problems.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings under the owners' petition for injunctions and damages.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that &sect; 709C.1 did not unconstitutionally infringe on defendant's First Amendment free-speech rights as it promoted a compelling state interest, namely to protect public health, and it was narrowly tailored to promote that compelling interest. Section 709C.1 did not absolutely prohibit an infected person from having sexual relations with another, and it did not compel the public disclosure of an infected person's HIV status, as an infected person could privately inform a potential sexual partner of his or her condition. Section 709C.1 was not impermissibly vague because when read as a whole and considered in light of common knowledge and related statutes, it clearly gave fair warning that the transfer of semen through sexual intercourse could transmit the virus and was therefore prohibited. Section 709C.1 did not unconstitutionally infringe on defendant's privacy rights because the State had a compelling interest in discouraging the spread of the virus and protecting human life.</SPAN></P>

He was accused of touching a female patient's genitals in his role as a nursing assistant in a psychiatric unit of a hospital. Defendant's motion to dismiss the trial information was granted, and the State sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the district court erred when it determined that &sect; 709.15 did not apply to defendant based on his duties as a nursing assistant. Defendant provided treatment and assessment. His provision of such services qualified him as a &quot;counselor or therapist&quot; for purposes of &sect; 709.15. The appellate court noted that it was improper for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion to dismiss. Next, defendant's constitutional challenges were rejected as well. Section 709.15 was not void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment because the language of such applied to the services that defendant was providing to the victim in question.

First, the fact that the offenses were committed prior to the enactment of Iowa's sexually violent predator act did not mean that his ex post facto and double jeopardy rights were violated. Next, the fact that the act had been amended since the decision in Garren did not mean that it was now criminal in nature. The fact that it was a crime to escape after commitment under Iowa Code &sect; 229A.5B (2003) did not alter the civil nature of the whole chapter. Further, punishment was not intended by Iowa Code &sect; 229A.5C (2003); punishment was only involved if an offender was found guilty of another crime while confined as a sex offender. In addition, Iowa Code &sect; 229A.8(3) (2003) evidenced an intent only to hold offenders as long as necessary, it did not shift the burden of proof to the offender.

In addition to including statements defendant made that her husband was not returning, the affidavit stated that the authorities launched a nationwide search for her husband after discovering that he had left no forwarding address, that the authorities had checked on defendant's statements, and that defendant's financial disclosures to the Iowa Department of Human Services were inconsistent with the record of payments made on her mortgage, discussed the long history of domestic violence in defendant's marriage, and noted defendant's new romantic relationship.

The district court granted summary judgment to the seller, and the broker sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that district court erred in concluding the parties had a listing agreement since the seller specifically did not want the property listed. A listing agreement was just one of the many types of services provided by brokers. Listing meant advertising the property to the public for sale. As such, Iowa Admin.

After a bench trial, the magistrate found defendant not guilty of harassment due to the State's failure to prove intent to harass, but continued the no-contact order for two years from the original issue date, with a limited exception allowing defendant to visit her physician's neighbors.

The grandparents, who were the father's parents, sought visitation with the children after mother stopped allowing the children to visit them.

They argued that the mother should have challenged the constitutionality of the visitation order at or before trial, not as a defense in contempt proceedings.

The court decided that giving continued effect to the visitation order was unjust because it constituted a continuing violation of the mother's constitutional right as a mother to make decisions regarding her children's well-being absent a showing of harm to them or her unfitness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a bench trial in the Iowa District Court for Polk County of two counts of child endangerment, in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 726.6(1)(a) (2001), and one count of driving while barred, in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 321.561. Defendant's convictions resulted from the deaths of his two young nephews who fell from the bed of a truck that defendant was driving. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised five issues: (1) the evidence was insufficient to prove the necessary mens rea for child endangerment; (2) the judge abused his discretion in refusing to recuse himself; (3) the court failed to exercise its discretion when sentencing defendant to prison on the driving-while-barred conviction; (4) the court considered an improper factor in sentencing defendant to consecutive prison terms; and (5) Iowa Code &sect; 726.6(1) was unconstitutionally vague. The Supreme Court of Iowa held that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding defendant knowingly acted in a manner that created a substantial risk to the physical safety of the children in his custody. In addition, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by failing to recuse himself after defendant filed a complaint against the judge with the commission on judicial qualifications. The trial court failed to exercise its discretion to consider probation as a sentencing option on the driving-while-barred charge. The requirement that defendant be sentenced to confinement on the child-endangerment charges did not preclude the option of a suspended sentence on the driving-while-barred charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction and sentence on the child-endangerment charges and judgment of conviction on the driving while barred were affirmed. The sentence on the driving while barred charge was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing on that charge.</SPAN></P>

The Iowa Court of Appeals affirmed. The instant court granted further review as to his claim that counsel was ineffective and as to whether there was insufficient evidence to convict him on one of the counts of neglect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The event that led to the child's death occurred the day after defendant had gone on a methamphetamine (meth) binge. First, defendant was convicted in a bench trial, and defendant was not required to move for a judgment of acquittal to preserve error on a sufficiency of the evidence claim. Thus, where counsel did not move for a &quot;specific&quot; judgment of acquittal, he was not ineffective. Secondly, the Iowa Supreme Court held there was substantial evidence to have supported the district court's findings that, per Iowa Code &sect; 726.3, defendant knowingly (or at least recklessly) exposed his child to danger against which she could not have reasonably been expected to have protected herself. Defendant was a chronic meth user, and expert testimony detailed in a comprehensive fashion the dangers a parent's meth use posed to his custodial children. Basically, a meth user was removed physically and emotionally from the household. The supreme court also noted that the after-effects were staggering, much more so than with other drugs such as alcohol or marijuana. Finally, &sect; 726.3 forbade a parent from exposing a child to a danger; it did not distinguish among the sources of the dangers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee home owners claimed damages from appellants, a city and the lessor of a concrete business, on their nuisance claim and permanent damages on their inverse condemnation claim. The trial court awarded permanent and special damages. The Iowa Court of Appeals affirmed on all issues except one; it reversed the trial court's finding that the city's rezoning was a taking without just compensation. The city and the business owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first issue was whether the city took the home owners' property without the payment of just compensation in violation of constitutional provisions when it rezoned the business property to allow the construction and operation of a ready mix plant in close proximity to their property. The Supreme Court of Iowa held that the city had not taken the their property in violation of constitutional provisions. The owners argued that the city's action in rezoning the business property allowed the construction and the operation of the plant that resulted in a nuisance, which directly affected their use and enjoyment of their home. The supreme court held that the consequential damages rule applied. The business owner decided, subject to the ordinance, where the plant was to be built and how it would be operated. The city in enacting the rezoning ordinance took no action in determining those matters. It was not the operation and maintenance of government property that produced the nuisance. Requiring the business and the lessor of the property, rather than the city, to pay for the easement that the plant's actions imposed on the owners' property was not inconsistent with that reasoning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeals was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1993 appellant corporate taxpayer realized a capital gain which was classified as &quot;nonbusiness&quot; for Iowa tax purposes and was not taxed in Iowa. It later applied for a refund on its 1993 Iowa income tax based on a carryback of a capital loss sustained in 1995. Appellee Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance denied the refund. The board of tax review affirmed. The Iowa District Court for Polk County affirmed and the taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department contended that the nonbusiness-allocation rules, used to calculate the line 9 figure on the Iowa tax return, only applied to items of income contained in the taxpayer's Iowa net income, the figure found on line 8. Because the $ 557,000,000 capital gain was completely offset at the federal level, none of that gain was included in the taxpayer's Iowa net income on line 8. The Department argued that the taxpayer could not allocate gain that was not included in the first instance. Allowing allocation of such items, according to the Department, would amount to a double deduction and would also have the effect of offsetting capital loss against ordinary income, which was not permitted. The Department had a long-standing rule regarding capital-loss carrybacks that supported its interpretation, found in Iowa Admin. Code r. 701--53.3(1). That rule contemplated a scheme in which only items of income included in the taxpayer's federal taxable income were subject to allocation and apportionment. The &quot;refund&quot; requested by the taxpayer, amounting to over $ 550,000, would have been a windfall not mandated or even permitted by Iowa's law. The Department properly denied the claim.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed and reversed, stating that the statute was not unconstitutional under due process pursuant to U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, or Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9 because the right to marry and rear children without governmental interference was not present in the case. While the residency restriction might have impacted defendant and his family insofar as they could not choose the precise location where they could establish their home, it did not absolutely prevent them from living together.

After an order was entered in the case, a petition for a writ of certiorari was filed against the district court. In annulling the writ, the court determined that there was no standing to bring the action under U.S. Const. art. III or Iowa law. First, there was no standing as members of the general public because there was no injury that set them apart from the mass of citizens. Next, there was no standing based on being married because the district court's order did not effect anyone other than those persons in the civil union. Standing as taxpayers was meritless as well because there was no order increasing or diminishing any fund to which the parties had contributed or would have contributed to in the future. The pastor had no standing because he did not face criminal charges under Iowa Code &sect; 595.9 (2003) if he solemnized a marriage of a person in a civil union. The church failed to show that it had a personal interest in the case.

The Supreme Court of Iowa held that, because the sheriff did not elect to collect the claim for room and board under the Iowa Code ch. 626 alternative, but rather treated them as claims for restitution under Iowa Code ch. 910 and defendants received a full hearing on the restitution claim, it was not necessary for it to consider the argument that the &quot;shall approve&quot; language of Iowa Code &sect; 356.7(3) rendered it invalid. Nevertheless, it did so to provide guidance where a sheriff requested court approval of a claim as a condition precedent to collection of it under the regular judgment collection provisions of Iowa Code ch. 626, rather than through restitution. Defendants contended &sect; 356.7(3), by providing the court &quot;shall approve&quot; room-and-board claims, precluded the exercise of judicial power and therefore ran afoul of constitutional principles of due process, equal protection, and separation of powers.

Consequently, the corporation filed a claim against her estate on behalf of the Department to recover the payments. The administrator disallowed the claim. The trial court ordered the administrator to pay the corporation's claim to the extent of the value of the grantor's life estate. On appeal, the court found that trial court properly ruled that the estate was liable for the Department's claim for reimbursement of medical assistance payments made to the grantor. The trial court also correctly ruled that Iowa Code &sect; 249A.5(2)(c) (1995) required that the grantor's life estate be included in her probate estate for purposes of satisfying her debt to the Department.

Years later the patriarch's wife passed away. On a petition to construe the will, the Iowa District Court for Scott County ruled that the son was not entitled to the trust fund unless he survived his mother and mandated that appellees, the son's disinherited children, receive the trust fund. Appellant, the son's widow, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow claimed that her late husband's interest vested upon his father's death, and that she should have received the trust fund because the son had left everything to her. The supreme court agreed. The patriarch's will provided that in the event that the son survived his father, the father appointed the trust fund to his son as an &quot;indefeasibly vested interest in fee.&quot; That phrase plainly and specifically indicated that the son's interest vested at the moment of his father's death and was not subject to defeasance upon any subsequent event. Thus, the son was free to devise his vested remainder to his wife instead of his children. Once the son survived his father, the only uncertain event upon which appointment of the trust fund was predicated was fulfilled. His interest in the fund become an estate in possession when his mother's interest ended. It did not matter that the son did not survive his mother. Iowa Code &sect; 633.4701(1) of the Iowa Trust Code, Iowa Code &sect; 633.1101 et seq., did not apply retroactively to divest the son's estate of the vested property right because the provisions of the trust governed and the court was constrained to follow the testator's intent.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the State failed to carry its burden to prove good cause for the delay of defendant's trial as required by Iowa R. Crim.

The court held that the State failed to offer any reason to support its claim that pending motions could not be heard or that discovery could not be completed before the speedy trial deadline. The court found that the State was granted a continuance on the basis of judicial economy merely because the motions were pending and because the codefendants waived their right to a speedy trial, which were insufficient reasons to establish good cause. The court noted that because the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charges on speedy trial grounds, it did not address defendant's other claims of error pertaining to hearsay testimony, his suppression motion, the excessiveness of his sentence, and whether the statutes under which he was convicted were constitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the Iowa Constitution forbade enhancement of a crime on account of a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction for which no term of incarceration was imposed. The court declined to interpret the constitution to afford more protection than the federal constitution with respect to the use of prior uncounseled misdemeanor convictions. The court pointed out that the state right-to-counsel and due-process provisions were textually similar to their federal counterparts. With respect to defendant's right to counsel under Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 10, use of a prior conviction to enhance his present conviction did not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction. Nor did the court find any flaws in the federal analysis as applied to defendant's right to due process under the Iowa Constitution. Use of defendant's prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction was not so inherently unreliable that its use under a recidivist statute would abridge Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court concluded that the Iowa Constitution did not bar use of prior uncounseled misdemeanor convictions for later enhancement where the prior conviction did not itself result in a term of incarceration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and that the inference permitted in &sect; 710.10(4) violated free speech under the First Amendment. The court held that there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that defendant was attempting to entice away a minor for the purpose of performing an illegal act upon her. The minor testified that defendant blocked her path, said &quot;come over here,&quot; and gestured with his finger for her to come to him. According to a police officer's testimony, defendant said that the minor was smiling, that as soon as he made eye contact with her, she became scared, and that the look on her face was like she could read his mind and knew what he wanted to do to her later. However, because the court found that the trial court, in reaching its verdict, applied a statutory inference that was unconstitutional, it had to reverse the judgment and remand the case. Section 710.10(4) was overbroad because it substantially proscribed protected speech, and it could not be narrowed to cover only nonprotected speech. The statute was not only facially unconstitutional, it was unconstitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

These amendments simply changed the mechanics of providing and paying counsel for indigent parolees; instead of relying on the state public defender's office and budget, a court was required to appoint private attorneys who will be paid from the general fund.

On appeal, defendant urged, among other things, that the jury instructions were confusing, and there was insufficient evidence. As to whether the instructions created confusion, the supreme court disagreed with defendant because the elements set forth in one of the instructions conveyed various methods by which a person could violate that statute by causing the completed manufacture of a controlled substance. There was no inconsistency in the jury's acquittal of defendant with respect to a completed manufacture of a controlled substance, while convicting him based on the elements of a crime that did not require a completed manufacture. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Iowa District Court for Jones County, which dismissed his application for post-conviction relief on the grounds that his claim that the failure of the attorney general to take action regarding defendant's classification under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA), Iowa Code ch. 229A, was premature, as prison officials were not required to act until 90 days before his anticipated release in December 1995.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for sexual abuse under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 709.1(1) and 709.4(1) fell within the definition of a &quot;sexually violent offense&quot; under the SVPA. No action was taken regarding defendant's classification for SVPA purposes, and defendant claimed the failure to act denied him the right to be considered for early release. He cited no statutory authority, but pointed to an Iowa Department of Corrections (DOC) policy, which was adopted after his offense was committed. Defendant claimed the DOC policy increased the penal consequences of his criminal act and changed the terms of his sentence, thus it violated the ex post facto provisions of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10; Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 21, and separation-of-powers principles. The court held that any deprivation of defendant's consideration for early release was caused by the statute, not the DOC policy. The court concluded that the DOC screening policy did not purport to deal with the length of an inmate's sentence; it simply established a procedure for determining the inmate's SVP status. The court held that the DOC policy did not usurp the court's sentencing authority and did not violate the separation of powers principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court held that defendant's claims were ripe for consideration, but that the attorney general's failure to act and the DOC policy regarding SVP status determinations did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the federal and state constitutions, nor did it violate separate of powers principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Iowa District Court for Wright County, which dismissed the charge of tampering with a juror, a violation of Iowa Code &sect; 720.4 (2003), against defendant on the ground that &sect; 720.4 was unconstitutional as it was applied to defendant, in that it infringed upon her First Amendment right of free speech, because it criminalized speech that was not a threat or fighting words and that had a legitimate purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating &sect; 720.4 based on a phone conversation she had with a juror, who was involved in a criminal proceeding against defendant's friend. Defendant was part of a group that believed the mandatory minimum sentencing imposed on her friend was inappropriate and was contacting the media and others to express their disapproval of the sentencing scheme. The trial court found that &sect; 720.4 was not unconstitutionally vague, but that it was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. On appeal, the court found that, although defendant's conduct did not consist of threats or fighting words, a jury question existed as to whether defendant contacted the juror to intimidate or harass her in retaliation for convicting defendant's friend, and that such conduct, even when it included speech, was not protected by the First Amendment in light of the State's interest in preserving the fairness of the jury system. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 720.4 was vague, because a reasonable person reading &sect; 720.4 and considering its purpose would understand that harassment of jurors was prohibited whether the juror's service was ongoing or had terminated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment that dismissed the charge against defendant under the juror tampering statute and remanded the case for further proceedings.

Instead, the County claimed that the ordinance was a public health ordinance and that any indirect effect it may have had on the production, care, feeding, or housing of animals did not create a conflict with &sect; 331.304A so as to trigger the preemption doctrine. The court held that, while the County promoted the ordinance as a health measure, its plain effect was to regulate activities that were a part of livestock confinement operations regulated by &sect; 331.304A(2), and the local ordinance not only shared a common locus, but the activity regulated by the ordinance was, in effect, the same activity reserved for state regulation under state law. The court found that the ordinance set standards for toxic and odorous air emissions, safety for workers in confinement feeding operations, and water pollution by confinement feeding operations.

The DNR subsequently reversed its decision and ordered the company to obtain a permit and levied a civil penalty against the company for the failure to obtain a permit. The trial court affirmed the ruling, but the fine was vacated. The instant court affirmed the trial court's ruling and held that under Iowa Code &sect; 455B.305(1), the DNR had the authority to require a permit for the truck-to-trailer transfers of solid waste. Further, the company operated a transfer station. The instant court also held that Iowa Code &sect; 455B.301(18) was not vague as written as the definition given for a sanitary disposal project defined what type of facilities would come within its parameters. Finally, the DNR was not estopped from issuing its order as no exceptional circumstances existed that justified an exception to the general rule that equitable estoppel could not be used against government agencies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed House File (HF) 683 and 692 after the governor ordered the legislature into an extraordinary session.

The governor returned the bills to the secretary of state pursuant to the process for consideration of legislation passed during the last three days of a session, and used his item veto on several provisions of HF 692. The effect of the governor's vetoes was to eliminate the legislature's economic development priorities while preserving the governor's economic development priorities. The state supreme court reversed the trial court's ruling that upheld the governor's exercise of his item veto. The state supreme court held that HF 692 was not an appropriations bill as no portion of the bill allocated funds or operated as a rider or a condition to appropriate funds. Thus, the governor's veto power was limited to general or pocket veto power.

The court stated that, although the trial court correctly refused to apply the statutory immunity, the trial court erred in ruling that immunity from nuisance liability was an unconstitutional taking without distinguishing the elements of damage in a nuisance claim from the compensation demanded under the Takings Clause. The court concluded that &sect; 657.11(2) violated Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 18 to the extent it deprived the property owners from recovering damages for the diminution in value of their property. In addition, the court held that &sect; 657.11(2), as applied under the circumstances of the case, constituted an unreasonable exercise of the state's police power and therefore violated Iowa Const. art.

However, the Iowa Supreme Court held the provision at issue did not violate public policy, because it was specifically authorized by the legislature.

The supreme court noted the apparent unfairness of the physical-contact requirement as applied to the administrator's claim, which was not viable under the statute, notwithstanding the fact five eyewitnesses verified that an unknown vehicle caused the accident.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee father initiated proceedings to terminate appellant mother's parental rights so his new wife could adopt the child. The mother moved to have the Iowa District Court for Johnson County appoint an attorney for her in the termination proceedings. The trial court denied the mother's request for counsel at public expense, and the mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the mother was indigent, but that she was not entitled to have counsel appointed at public expense because the termination proceeding had been brought by the father pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 600A.5(1) and not by the county pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 232.114(1). The mother claimed that equal protection and due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and Iowa Code art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 9, required the court to appoint counsel at public expense. The appellate court agreed. The appellate court noted that even though the termination petition was brought by the father, and not the county, the county was still intimately involved in the process. As the right to parent was a fundamental right, the failure to appoint counsel to an indigent parent in an Iowa Code &sect; 600A action had to serve a compelling state interest. The state supreme court concluded that there was no narrowly tailored compelling state interest to deny counsel at public expense to indigent parents facing an involuntary termination of their parental rights under Iowa Code ch. 600A. The matter was remanded to appoint counsel for the mother at the public's expense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court was reversed, and the matter was remanded to have counsel appointed for the mother.</SPAN></P>

Prior to defendant leaving the scene of the accident, at least one witness smelled alcohol on her breath. Beer bottles were also found in and near the vehicle. A relative told the police that defendant might be at her cousin's apartment. Defendant's cousin allowed officers into the apartment under threat of arrest. The officers found defendant in the apartment. Defendant argued that evidence should have been suppressed because she had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the apartment as she spent, on average, three nights a week at the apartment in addition to regular visits, kept some personal effects there, and when she stayed overnight at the apartment, slept in the bedroom in which she was found. On appeal, the court found that (1) defendant's status was closer to that of an overnight social guest than a transitory business guest and she held a legitimate expectation of privacy in the apartment; (2) the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant; (3) although OWI was a comparatively serious matter, the circumstances did not support a warrantless entry into the apartment, as exigent circumstances did not exist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff racetrack gambling associations' suit against Iowa that Iowa Code &sect; 99F.11's 36 percent racetrack gambling tax (tax), compared to a 20 percent tax on riverboat gambling, the Iowa Supreme Court (court) decided the tax violated both U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 6 Equal Protection Clauses. On appeal, the United States Supreme Court (Court) decided the tax did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court did not opine if the tax violated Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 6; its remand was for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion. As the court had originally applied the federal rational basis test to determine if the tax violated &sect; 6, it revisited its ruling under &sect; 6 and stated: (1) its duty not to interfere with the Iowa Legislature's right to pass laws was no higher than its duty (constitutional duty) to protect citizens from discriminatory class legislation violating &sect; 6; and (2) it had the exclusive prerogative to determine the constitutionality of Iowa statutes challenged under the Iowa Constitution. The wording of &sect; 6, different than U.S. Const. XIV, but identical in scope, import, and purpose, stated, in part, that the Legislature was not to grant to a class of citizens privileges not equally belonging to all citizens. Upon closer factual scrutiny, the court decided that the Court's three enunciated rational bases (policy reasons) for upholding the two classifications were not plausible--credible. Under Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 6, the classifications' relationship to the statute's goal was too attenuated; the distinction was arbitrary or irrational.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa Supreme Court: (1) upheld its prior decision that the 36 percent tax rate statutory exception to the 20 percent tax rate on gambling receipts violated Iowa's constitutional equality provision; (2) reversed the trial court's decision upholding the 36 percent rate on racetracks; and (3) remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that even though defendant was not driving the truck, he actively participated in the commission of the crime because defendant joined the driver in punching the victim as they went down the road. Additionally, the State sufficiently proved causation because defendant's own patently reckless conduct clearly played a significant role in the victim's death. Defendant also claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge alleged defects in the information and the minutes of testimony and for failing to challenge &sect; 707A.6A(2)(a) as unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court held that the trial counsel did not fail to perform an essential duty because the information, when read in conjunction with the minutes of testimony, clearly indicated which paragraph of &sect; 707A.6A(2) was involved. Additionally, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied because it plainly required recklessness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's children lived with their mother. The children were adjudged children in need of assistance (CINA) under Iowa Code &sect; 232.2(6)(d) (2001) in October 2001 as it was determined that a member of their household was imminently likely to sexually abuse them. The father was not present at the CINA hearing, and there was no affidavit of service on the father or an affidavit of diligent search for that or subsequent hearings. The State petitioned to terminate the father's parental rights in March 2003 pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 232.116(1)(b), (d), (e), (f), and (i). The trial court found sufficient evidence existed to support abandonment as the father had not paid child support or provided any financial, emotional or other support since the inception of the case. The court of appeals vacated on the basis that there was insufficient evidence that the State had conducted a reasonably diligent search in attempting to serve the father. The state supreme court affirmed. As the State did not talk to the children or their caretaker to find the father, nor did it attempt to find possible forwarding addresses for the father, it did not make a reasonably diligent search to find the father.</SPAN></P>

The underlying suit to abate the nuisance had a long history of the abatement deadline being extended at the request of the owners, before the owners filed the instant suit for the injunction. The district court granted the injunction based upon the argument that the nuisance ordinance, Council Bluffs, Iowa, Mun. Code &sect; 1.97.030, was violative of equal protection as being vague. The instant suit, if had been construed as an appeal of the underlying suit's abatement order, was filed after the appeal period had run. The underlying suit's order to abate the nuisance was not subject to collateral attack. The supreme court also concluded that the district court should not have held that &sect; 1.97.030 was void for vagueness when the city, as buttressed by the underlying suit decisions, had, in effect, defined the term &quot;nuisance&quot; under &sect; 1.97.030 as it applied to the owners and the structure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an organization providing legal representation to children and an affiliated attorney, challenged certain administrative decisions of defendant Iowa District Court for Polk County, which (1) disqualified the organization from the representation of children in any pending case where a former intake attorney acted as counsel, (2) refused to remove the imputation of conflict, and (3) denied a request to modify the second order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Numerous child in need of assistance petitions were initiated while the attorney served as an intake attorney. Some time later, the attorney resigned her position and became the executive director of the organization. The district court found that there was a conflict of interest and disqualified the organization from the representation of children in any pending case where the attorney had prior substantial responsibility. The attorney ultimately resigned her position, but the district court refused to remove the imputation of the conflict to the organization. The court affirmed in part and noted that certain issues were not properly preserved for appellate review. The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the attorney's performance of certain actions, including providing legal advice and signing pleadings on behalf of the State, constituted a substantial responsibility under Iowa Code Prof. Resp. DR 9-101(B). Thus, under Iowa Code Prof. Resp. DR 5-105(E), the organization was disqualified. However, the court believed that the district court should have rescinded the imputation once the attorney resigned her position. Those orders were thus reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents sought increased visitation with their two children after their daughter died. The father and the grandparents at one point reached an agreement through mediation, but when the father stopped honoring the agreement, the grandparents moved forward with their petition. The trial court denied visitation and held that &sect; 598.35(3) was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed the ruling of the trial court. The appellate court held that &sect; 598.35(3) was unconstitutional in that while grandparent-grandchild relationships were beneficial and should be promoted, such a generalization fell short of establishing the type of harm that would justify state intervention into a parental decision denying contact. Section 598.35(3) all but failed to contemplate a harm justifying state intervention and was not narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest. The appellate court also held that the father had not waived his constitutional right to determine who had visitation rights with his children by entering into the mediation agreement, as to the extent the agreement was even a contract, the waiver of such fundamental rights was not knowingly and voluntarily made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that requiring cash bail violated her right to be bailable by sufficient sureties, pursuant to Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 12, and to be free from excessive bail as provided in Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court found that any federal constitutional claims were not properly presented for review. Although the case was moot, the court chose to review it because the issue of cash bonds was a matter of pressing public interest that was likely to recur yet evade review. Because the trial court acted in accordance with Iowa Code &sect; 811.2 (2001) in setting defendant's bail, the court considered the validity of the statute in light of Iowa Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 12, 17. The court observed that the availability of commercial bail bonds was relatively recent and that the framers of the Iowa Constitution would not have deemed it necessary. Accordingly, the court concluded that the sufficient sureties clause permitted cash only bail if an accused had access to a surety in some form. Defendant did not show that she had no access to sureties other than commercial bail bond companies. Moreover, considering that she had previously failed to appear, her cash bail was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's decisions related to bail, as well as its judgment and sentence.</SPAN></P>

The district court rejected their arguments and the court affirmed.

Second, &sect; 13.10 did not violate the ex post facto provisions of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 21 because its underlying purpose was not punitive. In fact, if the prisoners committed no further crimes, it would have no effect on them. Rather, the intent of the statute was to promote public safety. Additionally, any prison sanctions that could be applied for refusing to provide a specimen would not be ex post facto punishment because the sanctions did not enhance the sentence imposed for the offense originally committed.</SPAN></P>

The property owners had property in the urban renewal area. The property owners filed a petition for declaratory judgment challenging the city's financing of the project. The appellate court found that (1) it was within the city's discretion to amend the original urban renewal areas and combine them to promote economic development; (2) the city complied with the requirements of Iowa Code ch. 403 in designating the consolidated area an economic development area to support the urban renewal plan; and (3) the bonds and notes issued by the city to fund the project did not constitute constitutional debt because repayment was expressly conditioned upon the city council's appropriation of funds for repayment in each fiscal year.

The taxpayers were assessed Iowa income taxes for the years 1985 to 1992 for the interest income they received. The appellate court affirmed the trial court and held that under Iowa Code &sect; 422.8(2), the interest income was allocated to Iowa because it was derived from a business that was carried on within the state. The court also held that &sect; 422.8(2) did not violate the Commerce Clause as the tax was internally consistent such that if every state imposed an identical tax, no multiple taxation would result, because the statute provided an exclusion to prevent double taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facts showed that a woman called a dispatcher complaining that a male subject in her apartment had taken some pills, and had become physically aggressive towards her. The woman identified the male subject, and stated he had left in a flatbed truck. The officer located and stopped the truck, but defendant was the driver. The man who was the subject of the complaint was the passenger. The officer smelled alcohol on defendant, and defendant agreed to take a preliminary breath test, which he failed. Defendant asserted the officer did not have a specific and articulable suspicion to support a reasonable belief that criminal activity may have occurred, to have justified the stop and subsequent search. The appellate court cited a three-step analysis to the community caretaking exception for a warrantless search and seizure, and held the search fell within the latter exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. Based on the officer's knowledge of events, a reasonable person would have concluded the action the officer took in the interest of public safety and emergency aid was justified. Thus, the incriminating evidence was admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted further review after the Iowa Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court's judgment, after a bench trial, acquitting defendant of murder but convicting her of multiple acts of child endangerment, in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 726.6A, and, after reopening the record to hear purported newly discovered evidence, denying defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's boyfriend was living in the house when her child's day care center first alerted authorities to possible child abuse. The child finally died after a month during which defendant was the sole caregiver, and was found to have multiple broken bones and other injuries. Defendant was charged with murder and child endangerment and the boyfriend was separately tried and acquitted for murder and sexual abuse. The court held that there was no constitutionally deficient inconsistency in the resolution of the several charges, since they were both acquitted on the only charges they faced in common. The basic child endangerment statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 726.6, was not unconstitutionally vague, even though, as a child protective statute, it was necessarily broadly worded. It was clear what conduct was forbidden, and the charging instrument adequately alleged it without the need for a bill of particulars. Finally, the medical and other evidence, together with the child's age and the fact that defendant was the sole caregiver, was sufficient to prove defendant's guilt even under a theory in which she, not the boyfriend, was the source of all the injuries.</SPAN></P>

Liebbe, Associate Juvenile Judge. Parents, the county attorney, and the state attorney general were granted interlocutory appeal from a child in need of assistance permanency order directing the county attorney to file a petition to terminate parental rights.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department of human services took custody of appellant parents' children, placed them in foster care, and later recommended termination of parental rights during a permanency hearing. Finding the permanency plan unacceptable, the Iowa District Court for Scott County directed appellant county attorney to file a petition to terminate the parents' parental rights. All of the parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an interlocutory appeal, the main issue was to determine whether the juvenile court had authority to direct the county attorney to file a petition to initiate termination proceedings. The supreme court determined that pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 232.58(3)(c) (2001), the juvenile court had authority to direct the county attorney to initiate termination proceedings. In the interests of a child, the doctrine of separation of powers was not violated because separate spheres of governmental authority could overlap. The statute was constitutionally designed to allow the judicial and executive branches to share the same responsibility thereby ensuring the best interests of a child. Further, any potential ethical conflicts facing the county attorney were remedied by the juvenile court's direction to initiate termination proceedings. Given the mother's prior record of inconsistent participation in services and seeming lack of interest in learning new parenting skills, there was evidence supporting the juvenile court's action; however, the mother was making reasonable progress toward achieving the permanency goal. Thus, it was error to direct the initiation of termination proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Iowa Department of Transportation (the agency) enforced Iowa Code &sect; 306C.11 (1999) against appellant high school, requiring it to remove 37 booster or advertising signs from its athletic field fence visible to the traveled portion of an adjoining State highway. The district court reversed the agency's decision. The agency appealed. The Iowa Court of Appeals affirmed. The supreme court granted the agency's petition for further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found the placards did not merely identify or celebrate boosters in the bleachers. They advertised goods and services available to the public well beyond the centerfield fence. If their sole purpose were to foster goodwill, there was no need to include addresses and telephone numbers on the signs. The supreme court found, as the agency pointed out, the goodwill generated by the signs was the very essence of advertising. Because the signs did not advertise products or services available on the property, they did not qualify for an on-premise exception under the plain meaning of Iowa Code &sect; 306C.11(2). The supreme court held that the district court erred in so ruling. The agency challenged the district court's finding that the distinction drawn in Iowa Code &sect; 306C.11 between on-premise and off-premise signs amounted to an unconstitutional content-based regulation of commercial speech. The supreme court concluded that Iowa Code &sect; 306C.11 drew a legitimate distinction between on-premise and off-premise signs and regulated the signage at issue consistent with constitutional norms pertaining to commercial speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeals was vacated. The district court's judgment was vacated and remanded with instructions for an order upholding the agency's order to remove the signs.</SPAN></P>
