</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought judicial review in the Ross County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) of his reclassification as a Tier III sex offender under R.C. Chapter 2950, as amended by Am. Sub. S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) (S.B. 10). The trial court denied his request for appointed counsel and overruled his petition. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate said retroactively applying S.B. 10 to him was an ex post facto law. The appellate court held S.B. 10's amendments did not require a departure from holdings that R.C. Chapter 2950 was civil, so they were not ex post facto laws, nor was their retroactive application unconstitutional, under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, because the legislature intended to apply them retroactively, but they were remedial. The inmate was not entitled to appointed counsel because (1) S.B. 10 was civil, and (2) he had no substantial liberty interest in his prior classification. His reclassification did not offend separation of powers because (1) such classification was a legislative function, (2) his classification was a collateral consequence of his criminal conduct, and (3) he had no reasonable expectation R.C. Chapter 2950 would not be amended, so S.B. 10 did not abrogate a final judicial determination, nor did it interfere with judicial power to sentence a sex offender, as it was not punitive. His reclassification was not a multiple punishment barred by double jeopardy. He had no standing to contest residency restrictions in R.C. 2950.034(A), nor was the issue ripe, due to his incarceration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4117.01(C)(19) from collective bargaining units, based on amendments made to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4117.01(C)(19) and 4117.14(C)(6). Relators sought mandamus to determine the constitutionality of the amended statutes. The matter was referred to the magistrate, who made findings of fact and conclusions of law. The magistrate determined that relators had a plain and adequate remedy at law and accordingly, the relief requested should be denied. The objections by relators contended that the magistrate erred in finding that they had an adequate remedy at law through an action in injunction and/or declaratory judgment. The court found that the only individuals affected by the amended statutes were those employees of the State who were required to be licensed attorneys in order to perform their job duties. Accordingly, the instant action was not a &quot;rare case&quot; that presented &quot;exceptional circumstances that demanded early resolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the objections to the magistrate's decision and adopted the magistrate's decision as its own. The request for a writ of mandamus and/or prohibition was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Director of the Ohio Department of Commerce, sought review of a judgment from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, a decedent's estate executor, in the executor's class action, alleging that the Director's retention of interest earned on unclaimed funds pursuant to R.C. &sect; 169.08(D) violated the Takings Clause. The executor cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the executor's mother died, she left unclaimed funds. The executor made a claim and he was paid the principal amounts, interest until it was statutorily deemed not recoverable under &sect; 169.08(D), less an administrative fee. He filed the class action based on Ohio's Unclaimed Funds Act, codified at R.C. &sect; 169.01 et seq., and sought a declaration that the Director's retention of interest earned on unclaimed funds pursuant to R.C. &sect; 169.08(D) violated the Takings Clause of the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions. The trial court certified the class and determined the membership. The trial court held that the retention of interest under &sect; 169.08(D) was unconstitutional, it granted the executor a permanent injunction, and it stayed the decision pending appeal. On appeal, the court looked to other states' unclaimed property statutes and found that there was nothing unconstitutional by the Director's retention of interest in the UFA. Although there was no presumption of abandonment in the UFA and title admittedly remained with the owner, custody passed to the State. Further, as the property lapse was triggered by the owner's inaction rather than overt state action, no taking occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Howland Township Board of Trustees challenged decision of Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), dismissing its administrative appeal, overruling its motion to stay, and overruling its motion for nunc pro tunc order to stay annexation of property from township to City of Warren.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees petitioned to have their property annexed from the Howland Township to the City of Warren, because the township refused to rezone their property from residential to commercial. The petition was approved and appellant Howland Township Board of Trustees challenged the decision and moved for a stay of the annexation pending appeal. Because the appeal sought to have the statutory process by which the annexation was completed decreed unconstitutional, it was not moot. Appellant had the right to appeal a denial of an annexation petition through Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506, but had the right to challenge the approval of an annexation only through an Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.07 injunction action. Appellant, as a political subdivision of the state, could not assert the protections of the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses against its creating state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that appeal was not moot because it challenged constitutionality of annexation process, and appellant Howland Township Board of Trustees was required to use injunction, rather than appeal, to challenge annexation approval.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to retroactive legislation, appellee corporation filed a complaint with the county board of revision challenging the valuation of certain of its property. Appellant board of education counterclaimed, asserting the valuation was correct. The board of revision granted the corporation a reduction for three tax years. The Ohio Board of Tax Appeals affirmed the decision, and the board of education appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint on which the corporation prevailed had been preceded by a complaint that was dismissed because it had been prepared by a nonlawyer. However, the corporation filed the second complaint raising the same issues after legislation was passed permitted the refiling of complaints that had been dismissed on such grounds prior to passage of the legislation. A nonlawyer drafted and verified the second complaint's allegations and then a lawyer reviewed, signed, and filed it for the corporation. The appellate court held that, despite the nonlawyer's role in preparing the second complaint, the lawyer's treatment of the complaint constituted preparation and filing of a verified complaint sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the board of revision. However, the court also held that the board of education was correct that, as applied to permit refiling of previously dismissed complaints, Sub. H.B. 694, 1998 Leg., 147 Ohio Laws, pt. III, 5373, violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 because it was substantively retroactive legislation that created new rights and new burdens, rather than merely remedial legislation. Accordingly, the refiling was not permitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals' determination that the board of revision had jurisdiction over the complaint, but reversed the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals' decision regarding the validity of the retroactive legislation as applied in the case, and remanded the case with instructions that the valuation of the corporation's property for the relevant tax years be set at the amounts originally assessed.</SPAN></P>

IV, para. 406(A)(4) was not unconstitutional as applied to the subject property. That section was rationally related to a legitimate government interest, which was maintaining the aesthetics and character of the surrounding rural residential property, and the trial court's decision was supported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. The Board had received a number of letters from neighboring property owners expressing concern that billboards in the residential areas would be a nuisance and would detract from the character of the rural residential landscape.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant subcontractor sought a declaration in the Columbiana County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that appellee city unlawfully charged him a contractor's registration fee and that its ordinance pertaining to such fee was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance required the subcontractor to register and pay a fee. The appellate court held the trial court's entry quoting the subcontractor's brief and adopting the city's contrary position satisfied R.C. 2721.02(A) because its refusal to adopt specific declarations was equal to a negative declaration, under &sect; 2721.02(A). The subcontractor was not exempt for working on a &quot;public project&quot; because a private party hired him to work on a private project. He fit the ordinance's definition of a subcontractor by assuming duties of a primary contractor who contracted to provide services in the city. The city did not have to file affidavits showing the ordinance's rational relationship to a legitimate interest because (1) the court was allowed to conceive of grounds for the ordinance, and (2) its language showed legitimate interests its registration requirement advanced. The ordinance, as applied to the subcontractor, did not conflict with R.C. 715.27 because the statute did not mention non-specialty contractors, such as the subcontractor, so it neither granted him rights nor barred his registration. It did not allow that which the statute barred or bar that which the statute allowed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County (Ohio) convicted defendant of one count of trafficking in crack cocaine, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03, and participating in a criminal gang, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.42, and denied defendant's motion to dismiss a specification which sought forfeiture of a truck seized during his arrest. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and fellow gang members were charged by indictment with trafficking in cocaine, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03, and engaging in a pattern of criminal gang activity, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.42. The indictment also included a number of forfeiture specifications, one of which involved a truck that was seized when defendant was arrested. Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pled guilty to one count of trafficking in cocaine and no contest to violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.42, but he was convicted of both offenses. The trial court also denied defendant's motion to dismiss the forfeiture specification involving the truck. The appellate court held that (1) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.42 was not unconstitutional because it was vague or overbroad; and (2) although defendant lacked standing to appeal the trial court's judgment denying his motion to dismiss the forfeiture specification because he claimed on appeal that the truck belonged to his mother, and the appellate court would affirm the judgment denying defendant's motion, remand was necessary because the trial court's order did not provide for disposition of the truck.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court overruled defendant's constitutional challenges to Ohio's criminal gang statute, affirmed the trial court's judgments convicting defendant and denying defendant's motion to dismiss the forfeiture specification, but remanded the case to the trial court so the trial court could enter an order disposing of the truck.</SPAN></P>

The matter arose as a constitutional challenge to the JobsOhio Act, at R.C. 187.01 et seq. and R.C. 4313.01 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PAG and various legislators alleged that the General Assembly and the current administration had created the NFPC, which was an unconstitutionally chartered corporation, and that it would spend government revenues secretly and free from accountability. They asserted that the legislation violated the Ohio Constitution in numerous ways. Appellees filed motions to dismiss, arguing that appellants lacked standing to bring the action and that the claims were not ripe. The trial court found that appellants each lacked standing to pursue the claims, and it accordingly dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court found the trial court's determination that appellants did not have public-right standing did not cause them prejudice, as they did not show the kind of rare and extraordinary circumstances necessary to invoke public-interest standing. R.C. 187.09(B) did not provide a statutory basis for standing for the constitutional challenge, and the legislators did not have legislative standing. There was not a great public interest shown to confer standing on appellants. Their speaking motion to declare &sect; 187.09&nbsp;unconstitutional also failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. It also denied appellants' speaking motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner consumer sued respondents manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division, in a product-liability action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consumer said the statutes in question violated various provisions of the Ohio Constitution. The supreme court found she had no standing to challenge R.C. 2315.20. It found R.C. 2315.18, limiting noneconomic damages, and R.C. 2315.21, limiting punitive damages, did not offend her right to a jury trial because (1) they only required courts to apply statutory limits to facts found by a jury, and (2) they did not abrogate a jury's right to award punitive damages. They did not violate the &quot;open courts&quot; and &quot;right to a remedy&quot; provisions of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 because (1) they did not wholly deny a remedy, and (2) punitive damages were not a remedy for injuries. They did not offend due process because they were rationally related to limiting uncertain damage awards and were not arbitrary. They did not offend equal protection because, under a rational basis test, they were rationally related to a legitimate state interest in making the state's civil justice system fairer. The damage limits did not intrude on the judicial power to find damages, contrary to separation of powers. Reasons for finding the statutes' predecessors unconstitutional were adequately addressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sex offender received a notice of new classification and registration duties based on Ohio's Adam Walsh Act, R.C. Chapter 2950, reclassifying him as a Tier III sex offender, which he challenged. The Richland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) found S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) was unconstitutional both facially and as applied as it violated the prohibitions against both retroactive and ex post facto laws. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred when it found that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the trial court erred by finding that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) was unconstitutional. S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) which amended R.C. Chapter 2950, was constitutional and thus, the Adam Walsh Act did not violate prohibitions against retroactive or ex post facto laws. Also, there was no violation of the right to contract pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding, relators citizens filed a complaint in mandamus against respondents county officials seeking (1) a declaratory judgment that Am. Sub. H.B. 509, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2012) (H.B. 509), abolishing the current Sandusky County, Ohio, County Court, was unconstitutional and (2) to order respondents to hold an election of judges for the current county court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">H.B. 509 appointed two judges to a new &quot;Sandusky County Municipal Court&quot; until an election in November 2013, by amending R.C. 1901.01, 1901.02, and 1901.08. Amended R.C. 1901.01 and 1901.02, abolishing one court and creating a new court, was constitutional because the legislature had such power in Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. Amended R.C. 1901.08 was unconstitutional because the legislature had no power to appoint judges, under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 27. Ohio Const. art. XVII, &sect; 1, letting the legislature extend existing terms of office, did not apply because (1) existing terms of office would cease to exist, and (2) the new judgeship did not yet exist nor had any judge been elected to it. A claim that elected judges would serve another year in the capacity to which they were elected failed because they were not elected to the new court. The citizens were entitled to a writ of mandamus because (1) they were partly entitled to the relief sought by showing parts of H.B. 509 were unconstitutional, (2) the officials had a legal duty to have judges elected, and, (3) since the November 2012 election was less than two months away, there was no adequate legal remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, several citizen groups and individual citizens, appealed from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that found Am. Sub. H.B. 405 (Ohio) that authorized Ohio's participation in the multi-state lottery, to be constitutional, but concluded certain provisions of that legislation were unconstitutional insofar as they returned lottery income to the general fund. The citizens argued seven assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the statutory language enacted by Am. Sub. H.B. 405 (Ohio), the lottery commission began participation in a lottery game in May 2002, as a party to and under the terms of a formal agreement known as the Multi-State Lottery Agreement. Upon an unsuccessful challenge to the constitutionality of the legislation that provided for participation in the lottery, the appellate court found that, while the citizens were correct that a multi-state lottery, by definition, required mutual agreement among the participating states permitting each other to take part, the agreement did not rise to the level of a violation of Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 6. Am. Sub. H.B. 405 (Ohio) did not violate the single-subject rule as a test for constitutionality of legislation. Furthermore, no violation of the spirit of the law could be found either. Finally, those provisions in Am. Sub. H.B. 405 (Ohio) concerning the offset of Ohio General Fund Revenues previously allocated to education by anticipated revenues from the multi-state lottery violated the Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 6 mandate that all lottery proceeds go to fund education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police bargaining representative filed an unfair labor practice charge against appellant city. Appellee, the State Employment Relations Board (SERB) filed a complaint and the association was allowed to intervene. SERB issued an opinion finding that the city violated R.C. 4117.11(A)(1) and (5). The Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) affirmed the decision and found that R.C. Chapter 4117 was constitutional. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the trial court erred in upholding SERB's decision. The appellate court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in upholding SERB's decision concluding that the city committed unfair labor practices. It was stipulated that the city was a public employer and that the police associations was the Board-certified bargaining representative for the city's police sergeant bargaining unit, of which the sergeant was the sole member. It appeared undisputed that the city refused to bargain to ultimate impasse with the bargaining representative on behalf of the police sergeant bargaining unit. Nothing in R.C. 4117.01(G), required the conclusion that &quot;to bargain collectively&quot; required that the representative represent more than one employee. Further, absent an assertion that a specific provision of R.C. Chapter 4117 represented an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority and in light of the fact that the Ohio Supreme Court had specifically found R.C. 4117.14(I) not to be unconstitutional on those grounds, the entirety of R.C. Chapter 4117 did not represent an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was killed during the scope of his employment. Appellee family members received worker's compensation benefits from the self-insured employer, filed an action against the tortfeasor, and sought insurance proceeds. The action settled, and the employer moved for release of funds held in escrow, claiming subrogation. The Williams County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) entered judgment, denying the motion. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In previous proceedings, portions of the subrogation statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.931, were found to be unconstitutional. The employer then argued that the prior subrogation statute was still effective. The appellate court agreed, and found that the legislature intended to revise the statutory subrogation rights and would not have repealed the former statute without the replacement statute. However, the family alternatively argued that if the former statute applied, it too was unconstitutional. The appellate court agreed, and found that the former statute improperly distinguished between claimants who tried their tort claims and those who settled. Even if constitutional, the employer in the instant case was not entitled to reimbursement because the injured employee was not a party to the family's litigation against the tortfeasor. The wrongful death action was brought by the administratrix of the decedent's estate, not the decedent himself. The former subrogation statute provided for subrogation to the employee's rights, not the administratrix's. Therefore, the trial court properly ordered the escrowed funds to be distributed to the administratrix.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the post-Foster consecutive sentences entered by the Jefferson County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) after a prior remand from the court. Defendant had been convicted of aggravated murder during a robbery, kidnapping, and burglary and found guilty of the death specifications. Additionally, defendant was convicted of kidnapping, aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and felonious assault, all with firearm specifications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's life sentence without parole on the aggravated murder charge was not at issue. On the other charges, the sentences, which were to run consecutively with one exception, totalled 46 years. A 15-year consecutive sentence was added for five firearm specifications. After defendant's convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, the court reversed and remanded for resentencing under Foster and modified the sentence so that the firearm specifications ran concurrently with each other. At resentencing, the trial court ordered 10-year sentences for all offenses, even for two offenses for which it had previously imposed only eight years; the trial court ordered the terms merged, and after merger, all terms ran consecutively, except the previously merged counts, for a total of 50 years with a consecutive term of three years for the sole remaining firearm specification. The court found no merit to an ex post clause argument based on existing case law and noted that the ex post facto clause applied to legislation, not judicial decisions, under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The court also found the sentencing statute created a presumption of minimum, concurrent sentences, not a guarantee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of harboring an unreasonably loud or disturbing animal, in violation of Columbus, Ohio, City Code 2327.14. The trial court found the evidence sufficient to establish a violation and imposed a fine of $ 100 plus costs. The Court of Appeals for Franklin County affirmed the decision concluding that Columbus, Ohio, City Code 2327.14 was not unconstitutionally vague. The record was certified for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Columbus, Ohio, City Code 2327.14 was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied. The state supreme court held that Columbus, Ohio, City Code 2327.14 was not unconstitutionally vague because it set forth sufficient standards to place a person of ordinary intelligence on notice of what conduct the statute prohibited. Defendant did not prove that the statute provided no standard of conduct at all. Thus, it was not unconstitutionally vague on its face. It was also not unconstitutionally vague as applied because nothing in the record suggested that the constant barking of defendant's dog for over one hour was not &quot;unreasonably loud or disturbing&quot; or not of such a character, intensity and duration as to disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. A person of ordinary intelligence would have understood that Columbus, Ohio, City Code 2327.14 prohibited her from allowing her dog to bark nonstop for over an hour at a level that could be heard while using a lawnmower. Defendant did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statute was so unclear that she could not reasonably understand that it prohibited the acts in which she engaged.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the application of the statute as applied to juveniles violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sent nude photographs of herself to a juvenile male. The court of appeals held that the court did not err in overruling defendant's motion to dismiss. R.C. 2907.31, as applied to juveniles, was not unconstitutionally vague. Enforcement of the statute did not result in an arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. Instead, the statute provided clear guidelines on precisely the type of activity that was unlawful. The statute did not make a distinction between adult offenders and juvenile offenders. The statute held the offending person strictly liable for their action, regardless of age. The only relevant inquiry pertaining to age is that of the victim. The statute did not distinguish between consensual and non-consensual &quot;sexting.&quot; Such a distinction was not necessary, especially as &quot;harmful to juveniles&quot; as defined in R.C. 2907.01(E) was analyzed under an objective standard. Defendant's conduct was that which was prohibited by the statute. Defendant was not both a victim and offender. Only defendant engaged in the unlawful act. Since the facts alleged in the complaint were found to be true, only defendant was in violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff condominium association filed an action against defendant building company, alleging that the company failed to perform construction on a seven-unit condominium in a workmanlike manner and that the company was negligent. On remand, the Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) held that the association's claims were time-barred by the statute of repose, R.C. 2305.131. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Construction was completed in 1990. In 2003, a condo owner notice a crack in his garage wall, and an investigation was undertaken. In 2005, the association first filed the action, but voluntarily dismissed the complaint. It refiled in August 2007. Initially, the trial court held that the statute of repose did not apply. The matter proceeded to a jury trial, and the jury awarded the association damages. The company appealed. The appellate court reversed the trial court, holding that improvement to real property encompassed the initial installation of the foundation and footers, and, therefore, &sect; 2305.121 was applicable. On remand, the trial court properly held that the statute of repose was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied. Furthermore, because the structural damage occurred beyond the 10-year statutory period, but before April 7, 2005, the effective date of the current statute of repose, the association was given a &quot;reasonable&quot; time to commence an action. The association's untimely commencement of the action more than two years after it was placed on notice of the likely cause of its damage was not &quot;reasonable,&quot; and, therefore, the claim was barred by &sect; 2305.121.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio appealed a decision from the Richland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which held that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008), was unconstitutional both facially and as applied to appellee inmate. The inmate was convicted of a sexual offense previously. The matter arose in the inmate's challenge to his sexual offender reclassification pursuant to R.C. 2950.031(E) and 2950.032(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, and he was originally classified as a sexually oriented offender. Thereafter, he was notified that pursuant to the Adam Walsh Act (AWA) and R.C. 2950.01 et seq., as amended by S.B. 10, he was reclassified as a Tier II sex offender. The inmate filed a petition to contest the reclassification, wherein he challenged the classification and the application of the AWA to him. The trial court relied on another case holding in determining that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional because it violated the prohibitions against retroactive and ex post facto laws. Accordingly, judgment was entered in favor of the inmate. On appeal, the matter was stayed pending disposition of the appeal in the precedential case. That case resulted in a reversal of the unconstitutionality holding. Upon lifting of the stay, the court relied on the appellate decision in the precedential case to find that the trial court decision was in error. Rather, S.B. 10 survived constitutional challenge on a number of issues, including the right to contract under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court and it remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wyandot County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, (Ohio) accepted appellant juvenile's admission to the charge of gross sexual imposition. The juvenile court conducted a disposition hearing. Later, the court conducted a juvenile sexual offender designation hearing, in which it categorized the juvenile as a Tier II sexual offender. The juvenile appealed his categorization as a Tier II sexual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile argued that the trial court abused its discretion in classifying him as a Tier II sex offender, based on an improper finding that the classification was mandated by his offense, and that the application of S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007), to his case was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that, pursuant to R.C. 2950.01(F)(1)(c), the juvenile court was required to classify the juvenile as a Tier II sex offender. Furthermore, the application of S.B. 10 did not violate the juvenile's due process rights under the Ohio and United States Constitutions, nor did it violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution and the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution. Finally, there was no violation of the juvenile's right to equal protection under the United States and Ohio Constitutions because the age classification, pursuant to R.C. 2152.83(B)(1), had a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest, as expressed in R.C. 2950.02.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with loitering in aid of drug offenses. His motion to dismiss was denied. The appellate court held that the ordinance was vague because its specific intent requirement was explicitly connected to the '&quot;among the circumstances&quot; language. Because proof of specific intent was not limited to the circumstances expressly contained in the ordinance, there was no guidance as to what conduct may deem illegal. The application of the circumstances set forth in the ordinance reached a significant amount of protected activity and could easily implicate a person's status, associates, mere presence, or otherwise innocent behavior. The ordinance permitted an offender's specific intent to be inferred from his constitutionally protected activities. Therefore, it was also unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on appellant juvenile's admissions, the Athens County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) found him to be delinquent for having committed two counts of rape, under R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), and one count of kidnapping, under R.C. 2905.01(A)(4). The trial court found him to be a serious youthful offender, pursuant to R.C. 2152.11, and classified him as a Tier III youthful offender registrant. Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that R.C. 2152.86 violated his right to due process. He contended that public registration for sex offenders constituted a shaming punishment. The appellate court held that the imposition of community notification requirements did not serve to render Ohio's community notification provisions punitive in nature. Further, the mere fact that community notification provisions might conflict with the principles of juvenile law did not establish a violation of due process. To establish such a violation, appellant needed to demonstrate that he had a fundamental right to not be treated like an adult in the proceeding. At best, he demonstrated that the juvenile code had some provisions that were in tension with the juvenile code's stated purposes, which was to be expected. Even if the registration requirements imposed against appellant under S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) constituted criminal punishment, that alone failed to demonstrate an unconstitutional denial of either substantive or procedural due process. Finally, there was no equal protection violation because the legitimate governmental aim was the protection of the public.</SPAN></P>

Granting summary judgment for the state, the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) found that R.C. 4921.30 was a valid general law and it did not unconstitutionally infringe upon the city's home-rule authority. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the trial court erred in concluding that R.C. 4921.30 was a general law and that its preemption provision did not violate municipal home-rule authority. The appellate court held that the trial court erred by granting the state of Ohio's motion for summary judgment. R.C. 4921.30 (2003), providing that any person or company engaged in the towing of motor vehicles was subject to regulation by the Ohio Public Utilities Commission as a for-hire motor carrier, was not a general law because it was not part of a comprehensive, statewide legislative enactment, it did not operate uniformly throughout the state, it did not set forth police regulations, but simply purported to limit municipal legislative power, and it did not prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally. Therefore, R.C. 4921.30&nbsp;unconstitutionally limited a municipality's home-rule police powers pursuant to Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. Also, local regulation of prices, routes, or services of tow trucks not genuinely responsive to safety concerns garnered no exemption from 49 U.S.C.S. 14501(c)(1)'s preemption rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition contesting his reclassification as a tier III sex offender under R.C. 2950.01 et seq., as amended by S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008), also known as the Adam Walsh Act (AWA). The Richland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) found that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008), was unconstitutional both facially and as applied to defendant. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the AWA violated the prohibitions against both retroactive and ex post facto laws. The appellate court examined the identical arguments that were accepted by the trial court in order to find the AWA unconstitutional and rejected those arguments. Virtually every Appellate District in Ohio had upheld the AWA against the identical challenges the trial court relied on to find it unconstitutional. The trial court erred by finding the AWA unconstitutional on the basis that it violated the right to contract pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee paternal grandmother filed a complaint seeking grandparent visitation under R.C. 3109.12. Appellant parents filed an answer. A magistrate recommended granting visitation. The parents filed objections. The Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division (Ohio), granted the grandmother reasonable companionship time with her grandson. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents argued that the trial court's decision was an unconstitutional application of R.C. 3109.12. The appellate court held that R.C. 3109.12 was unconstitutional as applied to the particular facts and circumstances of the case and violated the Equal Protection Clause. Under R.C. 3109.12, the Ohio General Assembly provided a means for extended family members of children born to unwed parents to involve themselves in the lives of such children, who did not benefit from a marital two-parent nuclear home environment. However, because the parents of the child had indeed married each other during the pendency of the grandmother's visitation complaint, there was no rational basis for differentiating married parents who were unmarried at the time of the complaint's filing from those who were married at that time. However, the doctrine of parental autonomy did not override the application of R.C. 3109.12(B) and thus, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to address the complaint for grandparent visitation. Technically speaking, the trial court did not err in concluding it had subject matter jurisdiction to proceed on the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was cited for a sign mounted on a truck parked next to his business. The appellate court held he did not show the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because its provision that some signs were not nonconforming was not confusing as the entire ordinance defined nonconforming signs, specified signs that were nonconforming but permissible, and, in the contested ordinance, specified signs that were nonconforming and not permissible. The ordinance was not overbroad because it barred the use of vehicles as a foundational base for on-premises signs, so it did not ban bumper stickers or decals routinely put on commercial vehicles. The ordinance was not arbitrary because a rational distinction could be drawn between distraction from a sign mounted on a vehicle and advertising painted on a vehicle. Defendant did not show the ordinance did not promote its goals of safety and aesthetics. Whitehall, Ohio, City Code 1127.06(a)(9), barring paper, cloth or similar temporary signs, was not vague or overbroad. &quot;Temporary sign&quot; was defined, and, based on a common understanding of the terms and definition, it gave reasonable notice of the proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village filed a declaratory judgment action against the property owner and her husband, seeking a declaration that Ordinance 96-20 was constitutional, and an order enforcing the ordinance against them. The trial court found the size requirement of the ordinance to be constitutional. The height requirement portion of the ordinance was held unconstitutional, but severable. Accordingly, the owner was ordered to remove the sign. The owners failed to remove the sign, and instead, painted over a portion of it, as well as adding another sign. The trial court ordered obliteration of all remnants of the old sign. Only one owner appealed, and the trial court denied the village's motion to dismiss the appeal, finding that a new ordinance did not render the appeal moot. The court found that the size requirement was a reasonable restriction that served a significant government interest, that it was not content-neutral, and that there were no violations of U.S. Const. amend. I. Further, the height restriction was properly found to be severable from the constitutional part of the ordinance. The remaining issues raised were not fully reviewable due to a lack of a complete record on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees filed suit for bodily injury claims as a consequence of negligent operation of an automobile by appellant. The jury returned verdicts for the appellees. Appellant challenged the award of prejudgment interest to appellees. Appellant argued, inter alia, that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest when the appellant made a good faith effort to settle the case and appellees did not, and that the trial court erred in computing the interest award. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court affirmed the award of prejudgment interest. The prejudgment interest ordered by the trial court was within the perimeter of its discretion, and was supported by competent, credible evidence. The evidence showed that appellee made a good faith effort to settle the case, right up to the first day of trial. The court reversed the amount of the prejudgment interest. The trial court incorrectly calculated the amount of the interest. The interest was to be computed from the date the cause of action accrued to the date on which the money is paid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) to one count of importuning and one count of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles. Defendant was placed on community control for a period of time and was also determined to be a Tier I sexual offender. Defendant did not file an appeal. Defendant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea under Crim.R. 32.1. The motion was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea because the statute on disseminating matter harmful to juveniles, R.C. 2907.31, was unconstitutionally vague, which in turn rendered the statute void and his conviction a manifest injustice. On appeal, the court found that defendant could not argue that he could not have reasonably understood that his conduct of disseminating harmful material to a police officer posing as a 15-year-old boy was proscribed. The statute clearly provided a person of ordinary intelligence with fair notice that this contemplated conduct was prohibited under the statute. Any purported vagueness in the language of the affirmative defense, which defendant did not attempt to assert, did not deprive defendant of due process in light of his particular conduct, and it was unnecessary for the court to determine whether the affirmative defense provision was in fact void for vagueness. In addition, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to have considered the timeliness of defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea in deciding to deny defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the post-release control statutes in several respects, each of which was premised on the Foster decision. The appellate court affirmed, holding that 1) as the post-release control provisions were not among the provisions excised or even addressed in Foster, they were presumptively constitutional; 2) defendant's sentences on two second-degree felonies, including the imposition of mandatory post-release control, accorded with Foster as they were within the statutory range and were authorized solely by his guilty plea without any additional findings by the court; 3) the claim that defendant might be subject to additional prison time if he violated his post-release control was not ripe for review; 4) Foster did not concern the imposition of mandatory sentences that did not require additional findings by a trial court, thus, the mandatory nature of post-release control did not violate Foster; and 5) delegation of the powers for managing post-release control to the adult parole authority did not usurp the judiciary's discretionary sentencing powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an earlier opinion, the state supreme court determined that appellant State's elementary and secondary public school financing system violated the state constitutional mandate of a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state. The state supreme court admonished the general assembly to create a new school-funding system, but provided no specific guidance. The general assembly then enacted various changes to the school-funding system. However, the state supreme court again found that the school-funding system was unconstitutional. Once again, specific guidance was not provided. The state supreme court then issued another opinion in which it ordered certain changes to the new school funding plan. After a motion for reconsideration was granted, the state supreme court decided the most recent opinion had to be vacated because the new school-funding plan was still unconstitutional and that the earlier opinions were the law of the case. In making that ruling, it did suggest to the general assembly that it focus on the core constitutional directive announced in the first case of doing a complete systematic overhaul of the school-funding system.</SPAN></P>

Appellant county auditor was an additional party to the appeal. The Board of Tax Appeals reduced the valuation of the corporation's property. The county board of revision and the county auditor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal had been signed and filed by an officer of the corporation. The appellate court held that the amendments contained in Sub. H.B. 694 permitted corporate officers to file a corporation's valuation complaints. The general assembly intended that Sub. H.B. 694 applied to complaints filed before it became effective. Where a substantive statute applied retroactively, it was unconstitutionally retroactive under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. A retroactive statute was substantive if it impaired vested rights, affected an accrued substantive right, or imposed new or additional burdens, duties, obligations, or liabilities as to a past transaction. Prior to Sub. H.B. 694, county officials had a vested legal right to have a complaint dismissed as invalid where it was filed by an unauthorized individual. The legislation stripped county officials of this right and imposed new and additional burdens on counties to defend against what would have been an invalid complaint in the absence of the new law. Therefore, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.13 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.19, as amended by Sub. H.B. 694, violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

Sub. S.B. 261, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2004) unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that the portion of Am. Sub. S.B. 261 which revised procedures for county veterans service commissions violated the uniformity clause and the one-subject rule of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 26 and 15(D). The trial court concluded that there was no &quot;blatant disunity&quot; between the provisions at issue and the appropriations bill which they were a part of, and that there was no violation of the one-subject rule or of the uniformity clause. On appeal, the court found that Am. Sub. S.B. 261 qualified as an appropriations bill. There was no violation of the one-subject rule, as a common purpose existed between the topics in the bill because the subject of funding and budgeting by agencies and political subdivisions was implicated throughout the bill. It was noted that restrictive funding was part of an appropriations bill and accordingly, the changes contemplated to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 5901 were sufficiently related to pass constitutional muster. There was also no violation of the uniformity rule, as the bill had the potential to apply to any and every county, although at present it only applied to several.</SPAN></P>

He later pled guilty to a probation violation and was sentenced to prison. He also pled guilty to robbery and felonious assault and was sentenced three to 15 years in prison. Following a hearing, the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) found that he was a sexual predator, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his sexual predator classification and that his constitutional rights were violated. The appellate court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's sexual predator adjudication, pursuant to the factors in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(3), as it found that defendant forcibly raped the victim yet failed to show remorse or take responsibility for his actions and that he was considered in the medium-high category for reoffending. The trial court also considered the two serious risk factors that the victim was unrelated to defendant and that defendant had a prior criminal history. Additionally, the appellate court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 et seq. did not violate either the Ohio or United States Constitutions as ex post facto or retroactive legislation. Nor did the statute create an unreasonable infringement upon defendant's personal liberties.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff received workers' compensation and her medical bills were paid by defendant Bureau of Workers' Compensation.

Thereafter, plaintiff moved for summary judgment to declare under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.931&nbsp;unconstitutional and for judgment against defendant bureau as a matter of law. The court found that there was a rational basis for the statute, namely to reimburse the workers' compensation fund when benefits have been paid to an injured worker as a result of the actions of a third party tortfeasor and to prevent workers from receiving double recovery of compensation and medical benefits.

The Portage County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division Ohio, ordered appellant committed to the department of youth services (DYS) and classified him as a discretionary Tier III juvenile sex offender registrant, but not as a public registry qualified sex offender. Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the juvenile court erred when it classified him as a juvenile sex offender registrant. The appellate court held that the juvenile court did not err by classifying appellant as a sex offender at the time of the disposition hearing, rather than at the time of his release from DYS, because the hearings prescribed by R.C. 2152.83(B) could have occurred at any time during the disposition period, including prior to commitment to the department of youth services or another secure facility. Further, the juvenile court was aware that it was not required to classify the juvenile as a sex offender because it stated that the sex offender classification was discretionary, not mandatory. It took into consideration various factors in addition to the nature of the offenses committed, including appellant's lack of remorse, the risk posed to the community, and his likelihood of reoffending. Finally, there was no equal protection violation because the statutory scheme treated all 14- and 15-year-old sex offenders in appellant's situation similarly.</SPAN></P>

Sub. H.B. 694, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2005) (Am. Sub. H.B. 694) due to the manner in which it was enacted. The trial court granted partial summary judgment to the unions and commissioners, and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State said Am. Sub. H.B. 694 was properly enacted. The appellate court found, when its text was prepared for signature by the speaker of the house and the president of the senate, under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(E), the text submitted for signature was that of Sub. H.B. 694, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2005) (Sub. H.B. 694), which Am. Sub. H.B. 694 amended. Under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(A), no law could be enacted without the concurrence of the majority of both legislative chambers, so Sub. H.B. 694 was not lawfully enacted. Conversely, no bill could become law without the attestation of the presiding officers of each chamber, and Am. Sub. H.B. 694 was not so enrolled, so it was not Ohio law. An attempt to correct the error by restating three statutes affected by Am. Sub. H.B. 694 in Am. Sub. H.B. 119, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) (Am. Sub. H.B. 119), was ineffective, under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D), because (1) Am. Sub. H.B. 119's title said it amended, rather than enacting, these provisions, but they were never validly enacted, and (2) much of their language was not underlined, as Ohio Admin.

The Commissioner explained to each taxpayer that taxes were owed, as well as penalties and other charges in some of the cases. The taxpayers' protests were reviewed by the BTA, which affirmed the Commissioner's determination in each case. In a consolidated appeal, the court found that wages were &quot;income&quot; for tax purposes, and that Ohio's statutory definition of &quot;adjusted gross income&quot; in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5747.01(A) and 5747.02(A) did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(A), Further, the first paragraph of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant motel owners pled no contest to violations of Strongsville, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 1454.13, allowing motel guests to stay beyond the 30-day limit. Also, one owner pled no contest to violating Strongsville, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 1454.03, for refusing to allow inspection of his occupancy records. The Berea Municipal Court (Ohio) found defendants guilty, imposed fines of $ 25 each, and placed them on one-year of probation. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the trial court erred in denying their motions to suppress and to dismiss, which alleged that the administrative search scheme was constitutionally unreasonable. The appellate court held that the ordinances under which defendants were convicted were unconstitutional because they failed to sufficiently limit the time, place, and scope of the administrative regulatory scheme. Merely because the execution of a warrantless search was conducted during regular business hours did not demonstrate that the ordinance itself was limited. Strongsville, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 1454.03 authorized the inspection of the guest register and merely provided that it &quot;shall always be open for inspection.&quot; That language did not satisfy the time requirement of Burger. Because most motels were open 24 hours, Strongsville, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 1454.03 was not time-limited and did not provide a motel owner a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant. Additionally, Strongsville, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 1454.13 was unconstitutional because it incorporated a licensing scheme that was nonexistent under Strongsville, Ohio, Ordinance ch. 1454.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed a decision of appellee, the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission, a division of appellee, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, finding that, pursuant to R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(c), the employee was not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits because she quit her job due to marital obligations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, the hearing officer did not violate the employee's due process rights when he refused to continue the hearing so the commission could issue subpoenas that the employee had previously requested. The employee failed to prove that she requested the subpoenas because she relied on a portion of the hearing that was transcribed as &quot;inaudible,&quot; and the language surrounding the &quot;inaudible&quot; notation did not illuminate the issue. Second, R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(c), which denied unemployment to individuals who quit work to marry or because of marital, parental, filial, or other domestic obligations, was not unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 4141.29(D)(2)(c) was written as gender neutral and, therefore, was not violative of equal protection. Any change in Ohio law was the province of the legislature, not the courts. Third, the employee, as a pro se litigant, was properly held to the same procedural standard as an attorney. Finally, the employee's evidence failed to support her claim that her transfer request was approved, but never complied with by the employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio challenged an order of the Cuyahoga Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) finding R.C. 3717.53 to be an unconstitutional attempt to preempt a city from exercising its home rule authority and that the amendments to R.C. 3717.53 contained within Am. Sub. H.B. 153, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2011), violated the one-subject rule of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">R.C. 3717.53 was not a general law because it was not part of a comprehensive, statewide legislative enactment, and it did not operate uniformly throughout the state. Moreover, the statute did not set forth police regulations but simply purported to limit municipal legislative power. It also did not prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally. Since R.C. 3717.53 was not a general law, it unconstitutionally limited the city's home rule police powers set forth in Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The appellate court further found the amendments to R.C. 3717.53 within Am. Sub. H.B. 153, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2011), were in violation of the one-subject rule set forth in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D), where the revisions to the statute lacked a rational connection to ant legitimate budgetary concerns. Rather, the revisions that concerned important local health questions appeared to be stealthily attached as a rider to an appropriations bill assured of adoption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sex offender challenged a decision from the Butler County Court of Common Pleas, Ohio, which denied his motion to tax expenses to appellee State as costs after the Ohio Supreme Court determined his reclassification as a Tier III sex offender under the Adam Walsh Act, S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After several convictions, the offender was classified as a sexually-oriented offender. After the passage of the Adam Walsh Act, the offender was reclassified as a Tier III sex offender. It was later determined in State v. Bodyke that portions of the Act were unconstitutional as violative of the separation of powers doctrine. Thereafter, the offender filed a motion seeking to tax his expenses as costs to the State. The trial court denied the request, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the offender was not entitled to court costs, copies, postage, or typewriter ribbons under Civ. R. 54(D). He was unable to recover paralegal fees because he was a pro se litigant. The offender was not entitled to recover expenses under Civ. R. 11 or R.C. 2323.51 because there was no frivolous or willful negligence shown. The prosecutor and attorney general acted in good faith because the law in effect at the time required reclassification; moreover, it was reasonable to presume that the Adam Walsh Act was constitutional. Finally, a hearing was not always necessary under R.C. 2323.51.</SPAN></P>

She asserted that &sect; 2745.01 was unconstitutional, and the employer filed a counterclaim for a declaration that it was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a press operator at the employer's manufacturing facility. She was seriously injured when a heavy metal coil fell on her legs and feet. The employee filed suit, and the employer filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of &sect; 2745.01. The trial court initially determined that &sect; 2745.01 was constitutional, and it then granted summary judgment to the employer on the employee's EIT claim. On appeal, the court disagreed with the trial court's summary judgment disposition. It held that &sect; 2745.01 was unconstitutional pursuant to judicial precedents as well as Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 34 and 35, as it imposed an excessive standard of requiring proof that an employer intended to cause injury, which did not further the comfort, health, safety, and general welfare of all employees. Further, it attempted to regulate an area that was beyond the reach of constitutional empowerment. The court also held that under the Fyffe three-prong test for a common law EIT, genuine issues of material fact existed as to all three elements, such that summary judgment for the employer was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of sexual imposition and gross sexual imposition of a child less than 13 years of age. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment and designated as a sexually-oriented offender. He was informed that he would be re-designated as a Tier II sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from his repeated sexual misconduct towards two minor step-granddaughters over an eight-year period of time. He was convicted and sentenced. On appeal, the court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's sentencing determination, as the decision whether to impose imprisonment or probation was within the trial court's discretion. Further, the sentencing decision was based on consideration of the factors and principles under R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. Defendant's classification as a Tier II offender under the new sexual offender classification scheme, which was enacted in S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008), was not unconstitutional. Relying on a prior precedent that touched on many of the same issues and prior holdings regarding former R.C. Chapter 2950, the court found no violation of defendant's right to protection from ex post facto laws, his right to substantive due process, his right to contract, and his right to procedural due process. The sex offender scheme under S.B. 10 was civil and non-punitive, it was not overly broad, and it did not deprive defendant of any protected liberty interest.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4511.213 placed an obligation on defendant to change lanes under these circumstances, and that the officer was justified in stopping defendant's vehicle. After the stop, the officer noticed, inter alia, an odor of alcohol, bloodshot eyes, and staggering. The appellate court found that the officer had specific and articulable facts to detain defendant for further investigation. The trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.213 was not overbroad since there was no constitutional right to travel at regulated speed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three separate cases consolidated for the purposes of appeal, plaintiff injured workers appealed the judgments of the Ohio Court of Claims which denied the workers' motions for summary judgment while granting the motion of defendants, state treasurer, state industrial commission, and the bureau of workers' compensation, for summary judgment in an action to recover on various tort claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the injured workers asserted that the trial court erred in granting the state officials' motion for summary judgment in each case.

The appellate court found that two of the workers did not establish a vested right in the intentional tort fund, and that the liability judgments against their employers alone did not establish such a vested right. Further, an injured worker could not seek to invoke the intentional tort immunity provided under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80, which had been declared unconstitutional, despite the fact that he paid premiums into the fund. Finally, the workers could not claim any property interest in indemnification by the intentional tort fund for damages, attorney fees, and costs arising out of the matter, as the statute was no longer operable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division, stayed plaintiff claimants' motion for summary judgment, and granted their motion to certify the following issues: did Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.931 violate Ohio Const. art I, &sect;&sect; 2, 16, 19, art. II, &sect;&sect; 15, 28, 35, and Ohio R. Civ. P. 49(C); and did it constitute an invalid waiver of the right to receive or retain workers' compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.931 did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 15, 28, 35, because it disrupted no rights or obligations of the claimants and the employer with regard to the payment of statutory workers' compensation benefits; and Am. Sub. H.B. No. 278 (Ohio 1995), which enacted Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.931, did not come close to violating the one subject rule.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.931 was not invalidated by Ohio R. Civ. P. 49(C), and it did not constitute an invalid waiver of the right to receive or retain workers' compensation benefits under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.80 (2000).  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.931 did violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 16, 19 because, under certain conditions, it acted to reduce an individual's tort recovery irrespective of whether a double recovery had actually occurred.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.913 violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, to the extent that it distinguished between individuals who tried their tort claims and individuals who settled their tort claims. However, the state supreme court stated that a workers' compensation subrogation statute was not per se unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court advised the federal court that the subrogation statute, in its present form, was unconstitutional under Ohio law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a union, a teacher, and a resident, sued appellees, a board of education, a Financial Planning and Supervision Commission, the Ohio State Auditor, and the Ohio State Superintendent of Public Instruction, in the Belmont County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for a declaration that R.C. &sect; 3316.01 et seq. was unconstitutional and to vacate an arbitrator's award. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contested statutes allowing appointment of a commission to administer the finances of the financially troubled school district they lived and worked in. The appellate court held the rational basis test determined if the commission's appointment violated equal protection because, while the right to vote was fundamental, diminishing the powers of an elected board of education due to a fiscal emergency did not violate it. The right to vote was not violated by legislative removal of some financial powers from a functioning elected board in a fiscal emergency. The right to have an elected board member retain every power over finances the member had when elected was not fundamental. The members had no absolute right of decision-making over finances when elected because, at that time, statutes allowed the commission's appointment. Such statutes were rationally related to legitimate state interests. R.C. &sect; 3316.07(A)(11), letting the commission reduce the district's workforce regardless of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), did not impair obligations under an existing contract because it was enacted before the district's CBA with its employees was signed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sex offender was convicted of three counts of gross sexual imposition and classified as a sexually oriented offender. He was later notified that he had been reclassified as a Tier II Sex Offender under the Ohio Adam Walsh Act (Act), R.C. Chapter 2950. He filed a petition to contest the application of the Act to him. The Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted the State's motion for summary judgment. The offender appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sex offender argued that the trial court erred by finding R.C. Chapter 2950 constitutional because it violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. The appellate court held that, because the offender's sentence had become final several years prior to the Adam Walsh Act, it was beyond the power of the legislature to vacate or modify it. Since the offender's classification as a sexually oriented offender with definite registration requirements constituted a final order of the lower court, he could not, under separation of powers and res judicata principles, be reclassified under the provisions of the amended Act with differing registration requirements. The reclassification, as a practical matter, nullified that part of the trial court's original judgment ordering him to register for a period of 10 years as a sexually oriented offender. There was no exception to the rule that final judgments could not be legislatively annulled in situations where the legislature had enacted new legislation. However, the legislation did not violate the ex post facto clause, or double jeopardy, because it was civil and nonpunitive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court reclassifying the sex offender as Tier II Sex Offender was reversed. However, the offender was required to continue registering as a sexually oriented offender pursuant to the trial court's original judgment entry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee grandmother sued appellant father in the Hardin County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division (Ohio), to obtain visitation with her grandchild under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3109.11 and 3109.051. Appellant father said &sect; 3109.051 was unconstitutional, and the Attorney General intervened to defend the statute's constitutionality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father objected to being ordered to allow grandparent visitation. The appellate court held Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.051(D) required a trial judge considering such visitation to review 16 factors. This analysis satisfied dicta in Troxel v. Granville by giving &quot;special weight&quot; to a parent's decision to decline grandparent visitation rights. Given the range and specificity of the factors, the trial court could not only give the parental decision the requisite &quot;special weight,&quot; but could also consider the child's best interest and balance that interest against the parent's choice, so Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3109.051 and 3109.11 were constitutional. The trial court weighed each factor and its impact on the father, grandmother, and child. The father's decision to limit visitation was given its required &quot;special weight,&quot; but, despite that &quot;special weight,&quot; it was found that it was in the child's best interest to grant the grandmother some visitation. This was not an abuse of discretion. The trial court found the father's concerns went to the nature, quality, and duration of visitation, rather than to its prohibition.</SPAN></P>
