</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of six counts of communication with a minor for immoral purposes, contrary to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.090, in the Superior Court of Mason County (Washington). Defendant appealed, asserting the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury heard consistent testimony that defendant suggested the following dares: (1) for a 12-year-old boy to walk next door and sexually proposition a neighbor; (2) for a boy to touch a girl's breasts; and (3) for 12-year-old girls to go outside and expose themselves. Moreover, the jury contemplated the children's testimony that defendant wrote sexually explicit language on the children's bodies and on the girls' bras. Defendant's contention that insufficient evidence existed to convict her of violating Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.090, because the State did not prove she received commercial gain or personal sexual gratification from her actions, was not persuasive. &quot;Personal gratification&quot; was not included as an element of &sect; 9.68A.090. Although defendant may not have specifically asked or forced the children to engage in the conduct, sufficient evidence existed in the record for any reasonable jury to be able to conclude that defendant participated in the sexually explicit activity. Thus, sufficient evidence existed in the record for the jury to reasonably conclude that defendant's participation was communication with children for immoral purposes, by words or conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city council member petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel respondent city to appoint his law firm to represent him in a lawsuit filed against the council member and his wife by developers. The Spokane County Superior Court, Washington, denied the writ petition. The city council member petitioned for direct review by the Washington Supreme Court, which denied the petition and transferred the case to the instant court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council member argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.96.041, because it did not say otherwise, required the city to hire him to defend himself and his wife. He contended that &sect; 4.96.041 operated to: (1) guarantee him the right to retain counsel of his choice; and (2) require that the city either contract directly with his chosen counsel to conduct his defense or reimburse him for expenses he incurred by contracting with counsel himself. The city argued that &sect; 4.96.041 did not give the council member the absolute right to represent himself. The instant court disagreed with the council member's contention that the city was required to hire him so that he could defend himself. The city charter prohibited any city officer from benefiting from a city contract. The council member was precluded from accepting an appointment, even if one were offered. The city charter did not conflict with &sect; 4.96.041. The instant court rejected the council member's equal protection argument. The city had a legitimate interest in distinguishing between elected city officers and outside entities, in determining who could benefit from transactions with the city. The appeal was not technically moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment denying the city council member's petition for writ of mandamus was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck a disabled vehicle in the rear. The disabled vehicle was partially blocking one lane of travel. Defendant struck the vehicle from behind, causing injuries to several persons on the scene. Defendant was charged with vehicular assault and driving under the influence of liquor. Defendant was found guilty on the driving under the influence charge, but the jury failed to reach a verdict on the other charge. At sentencing, defendant was ordered to pay restitution. Defendant then sought review. In affirming, the court determined that an award of restitution for misdemeanor offenses was permitted if there was a causal connection between the crime and the victim's damages. Substantial evidence supported the trial court's finding of causal connection. Moreover, the State was not collaterally estopped from litigating the &quot;causal connection&quot; issue at the restitution hearing because there was no verdict on the vehicular assault charge. Additionally, there were different burdens of proof required in the criminal case and the civil remedial proceeding. Finally, the court declined to hear defendant's issue concerning his right to a jury trial on the issue of restitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a jury verdict convicting him of premeditated first degree murder for his role in the strangling and stabbing death of a 15-year-old, contending, inter alia, that the doctrine of non-mutual collateral estoppel precluded the state from relitigating the codefendant's premeditation, in light of a different jury's conviction of his codefendant of the lesser degree offense of second degree intentional murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that by convicting his co-defendant of second degree intentional murder rather than premeditated first degree murder, the jury necessarily found that the co-defendant did not act with premeditated intent. Accordingly, appellant asserted that the State was barred in his trial from relitigating the issue of his co-defendant's premeditation. Appellant further argued that in failing to so instruct the jury, the trial court omitted an essential element of the offense, and that his attorney provided ineffective assistance by failing to argue this issue at trial. The court of appeals rejected these arguments and held that issues decided by the co-defendant's jury were not binding on the later trial of appellant. The court of appeals added that the trial court was not required to reference appellant's charged crime in its accomplice liability instruction and that it was sufficient to instruct the jury with language from the accomplice liability statute under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.08.020.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, land possessors, appealed the judgment of the Wahkiakum County Superior Court (Washington) that entered judgment awarding them some, but not all, land that was the subject of an adverse possession suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The possessors argued that the trial court erred by denying them a jury trial because they were guaranteed a jury trial for their adverse possession claim under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The court of appeals disagreed. Section 21 guaranteed the right to a jury trial in an action for ejectment but not in an action to quiet title, and that right had not been expanded by statute. If the case was only an equitable action to quiet title, there was no right to a jury trial. The possessors titled their complaint, &quot;complaint to quiet title.&quot; They alleged that they had been in possession for more than 10 years. They prayed that fee-simple title be established and quieted in them. Because they were in possession, they did not allege or seek ejectment. Necessarily then, their action was to quiet title, it was wholly equitable in nature, and art. I, &sect; 21 did not guarantee the right to a jury trial. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, homeowners, challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Spokane County, Washington, affirming appellee city council's reversal of the hearings examiner's denial of appellee landowner's application to rezone. On remand from the superior court, the hearing examiner approved the rezone in accordance with the city council's direction, and the homeowners elected not to supersede or enjoin the superior court judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner wanted to rezone the property to develop what was called mixed use, which included a close mix of retail, office, and residential uses. The city comprehensive plan would accommodate the mixed-use zoning, but the city had not yet enacted a zoning ordinance implementing the mixed-use designation. The superior court concluded, based on Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70B.040(1), that the city council had authority to authorize the rezone based upon the comprehensive plan. The appellate court ruled that the homeowners were not required to either enjoin or supersede an adverse zoning decision to proceed with the appeal. It was not necessary for the homeowners to appeal the hearing examiner's second decision, which complied with the city council's direction by order of the superior court. Furthermore, the appellate court ruled that the city council could not authorize a zone change based on the comprehensive plan, absent specific zoning regulations that were anticipated by the plan but never promulgated. A comprehensive plan, even when specifically addressing the concepts for the particular area, did not provide the necessary specific criteria for land use decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A driver had just left the house of several persons with long criminal histories.

Defendant was charged with taking a motor vehicle without permission. Defendant was convicted after his motion to suppress was denied. He then sought review. On review, the court determined that the driver did not testify that she signaled less than 100 feet before making the turns. However, because there was evidence to support a finding that the driver signaled less than 100 feet from the turns, the court remanded the case for additional findings of fact on the disputed issue. The trial court did not err in determining that the stop was not pretextual. There was no evidence that the officer witnessed any criminal activity before the stop was made. The fact that the officer knew of the criminal history of the driver's acquaintances was irrelevant, as the officer did not see the driver leave the residence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Clallam County, Washington, convicting him of first degree child rape, classifying him as a persistent offender, and sentencing him to life in prison without possibility of parole under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(4) (1996) (recodified Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.505) of the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the information charging him with first degree child rape was constitutionally defective for failure to set forth the alleged victim's name. The appellate ruled that the information was sufficient, as under the plain terms of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.073, the alleged victim's name was not a statutory element of first degree child rape. Defendant cited no common law authority for the proposition that the rape victim's name was an essential element. The appellate court also ruled that the lack of formal notice that defendant could be sentenced as a persistent offender if convicted did not deprive defendant of a fair trial or violate his due process rights because he received adequate notice of what was at stake, as the present appeal followed defendant's third trial. Furthermore, the POAA did not violate the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution or the Washington Constitution, and the POAA did not violate the separation of powers doctrine of Wash. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1 or Wash. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was twice sanctioned for insolence while he was incarcerated for stalking. In his personal restraint petition, he argued that the sanctions were based solely on the language he used in two written grievances that he filed and that such language in written grievances was protected from infringement by the First Amendment. The Superior Court for King County (Washington) denied the petition. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the rule prohibiting insolence passed the Turner tests, jail authorities had not unreasonably sanctioned petitioner when he violated the rule by including scandalous, insolent, and abusive language in his written grievances. The appellate court held that it followed that neither the rule itself nor the imposition of the sanctions represented an &quot;exaggerated response&quot; to the legitimate penological concerns that the rule was intended to foster. As both hearing officers painstakingly explained to petitioner in their written decisions, he needed to understand that the grievance procedure was for the purpose of bringing issues to the attention of the jail authorities, not a forum to make disparaging, degrading, abusive comments about correctional staff. As both administrative appeal officers explained, petitioner was not being punished or sanctioned for using the grievance process. Rather, he was being held accountable for the degrading, abusive language he chose to use in the exercise of his right, despite his knowledge of the applicable rule prohibiting insolence. In addition to its insolence, his language constituted a true threat and was unprotected by the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with unlawful manufacturing of a controlled substance, unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, unlawful possession of pseudoephedrine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, and driving while in suspended or revoked status in the third degree. The Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington, convicted defendant as charged, and defendant appealed the three drug crime convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to reopen the suppression hearing to allow him to testify that his briefcase was locked. The appellate court ruled that there was no abuse of discretion by denying defendant's motion to reopen. Defendant offered no proof or argument establishing that, if he testified at the suppression hearing, it was likely that the trial court would have believed his testimony over the officer's. Also, defendant failed to make a showing of deficient performance sufficient to overcome the strong presumption of effective assistance. Although defense counsel claimed that her performance was deficient, there was no basis in the record to conclude that the decision to not call defendant was some sort of oversight, as opposed to a strategic or tactical move. Furthermore, defendant failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a continuance to allow private counsel to represent him, or that the statute under which he was convicted for possession of pseudoephedrine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine was unconstitutionally ambiguous or that he was entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code ch. 42.17 and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 of the federal Civil Rights Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate ran for the county fire district commissioner against the incumbent. After he lost, the candidate sued respondents, claiming that the director coerced district employees to campaign for the incumbent. He alleged claims under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 42.17, the Washington Public Disclosure Act, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. He also alleged that the district was negligent in hiring the director. The trial court granted summary judgment for respondents and the candidate appealed. The court affirmed, stating that the incumbent had no private claim for damages under the Public Disclosure Act. Further, he failed to show that he was harmed by the district's hiring of the director. The director also did not violate the candidate's constitutional right to associate with his supporters and campaign for the office. Based on those foregoing reasons, the grant of summary judgment was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two hospital doctors petitioned for the detainee's additional 180-day involuntary treatment, stating he presented a danger of serious injury to himself and others. In a supporting affidavit they stated he was convicted of first degree statutory rape and taking indecent liberties of his daughters. After his incarceration, he was detained under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.05. He asserted the evidence was speculative and insufficient to submit to the jury. The jury found he suffered from a mental disorder, presented a likelihood of serious harm to others, was gravely disabled, and his detention for 180 days was in his best interest and the interest of others. His appeal involved the fact-specific issue of whether the evidence in his commitment hearing supported giving a particular jury instruction, private in nature, as it depended on testimony elicited at trial. Thus, it did not involve matters of continuing and substantial public interest to overcome its mootness. Because the 180-day commitment order had expired, the appellate court could not afford detainee relief; his appeal was moot.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Assuming a violation occurred, any error was harmless. At trial, a detective testified that during the second conversation with defendant from 12:25 p.m. to 2:38 p.m., he said that his girlfriend got the television from her brother. He also said that he was with his girlfriend at the time of the second fire. When asked about one of the murders, defendant said that he did not do it. Those statements were primarily exculpatory. Moreover, the evidence of defendant's guilt was substantial and included DNA from both murder scenes, the property recovered from defendant, the testimony from a fellow jail inmate, and defendant's earlier statements. In light of all the evidence, there was no reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for the admission of those statements. Therefore, the trial court did not err by admitting the statements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial in the Superior Court of King County (Washington), defendant was convicted of one count of third degree rape. Defendant had prior convictions for statutory second degree rape and first degree robbery. At sentencing on remand after appeal, the trial court imposed a life sentence under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.030(32). Defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that imposition of a life sentence under the POAA constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Const. amend. VIII and was a disproportionate sentence under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The appellate court noted that all his crimes were against persons. He contended that his current crime of third degree rape, a Class C felony, was not the type of crime that the POAA intended to punish. The POAA defined the term &quot;most serious offense&quot; to include Class A felonies such as second degree statutory rape and first degree robbery as well as third degree rape, the crimes defendant committed. The POAA reflected the intent of the voters, as stated in the law itself. The appellate court held defendant's sentence was not disproportionate. He contended that the POAA was an ex post facto law and a bill of attainder, and that his due process rights were violated when the persistent offender allegation was not charged in the information, tried to the jury, nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt. These arguments had been previously rejected by the State Supreme Court. Contrary to his argument, the appellate court found defendant received all the process due him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the pet owners argued, inter alia, that the ordinance violated equal protection, substantive due process, and was a taking without compensation. On the claim that the ordinance treated residents who kept exotic pets differently from those who kept dangerous dogs, the appellate court found that there was a legitimate interest in treating exotic animals and dangerous dogs differently. The city determined that exotic animals were more of a threat to the health and safety of its citizens, and that determination was sufficient on rational basis review to justify the disparate treatment between the classes of pet owners. On the substantive due process claim, the city had a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from exotic animals, the ban on possession within the city limits served that purpose, and the city's purpose in preserving the safety of both residents and the animals themselves would likely not have been served by a less drastic ordinance. Finally, the owners could not establish that their animals would be taken at all, and that, if taken, they would be taken for public use, as opposed to under the city's police powers, the owners' takings claim failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged seven trial court errors: (1) improper admission of gun-related and poverty evidence; (2) prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument suggesting that he was more likely to have committed the burglary because he was homeless and living in the jail; (3) an unconstitutional inference-of-intent instruction; (4) insufficient evidence of specific intent; (5) ineffective assistance of counsel; (6) cumulative error; and (7) unjustified controlled substance sentencing conditions. The instant court found prejudicial, cumulative error. The State conceded that admission of a receipt and a manual for an automatic handgun was error. The prejudicial effect of this evidence outweighed any relevance it might have had to the burglary. The permissive inference instruction, taken together with other errors, could have erroneously relieved the State of its burden of proving the requisite intent for burglary. Although the evidence was sufficient to support a guilty verdict, because of the other cumulative errors, the instant court could not say with certainty that the jury would have convicted defendant if the errors had not been committed or if the trial court had cured them.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the city summary judgment. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners purchased property intending to use the site as a recreational vehicle park. The city approved a special use permit with several conditions, including that stays on the property be limited to 48 hours. Thereafter, the landowners applied for a permit to expand their park and requesting to extend the 48-hour requirement to six to 12 months. The city refused to consider the application because the landowners had not complied with several conditions of the special use permit. The landowners unsuccessfully sought declaratory relief, arguing the land use regulation violated substantive due process, equal protection, and was a regulatory taking. The appellate court initially noted the landowners' lawsuit was an as-applied challenge to which declaratory relief was not appropriate. The appellate court held the regulation did not constitute a taking because it did not deprive the landowners of all reasonable economic use of the property. The appellate court further held the regulation was neither a violation of the landowners' substantive due process rights nor equal protection because legal nonconforming uses had a rational relationship to the ordinance's purpose.</SPAN></P>

After his arrest, defendant admitted to the burglary. Later, he moved to suppress his statements and the items seized after his arrest, but the trial court denied the motion. Defendant was convicted, but the court reversed on appeal. The court first found that the officer had reasonable suspicion for an investigative stop, and defendant had consented to the pat-down search. However, defendant's possession of the pipe was not sufficient probable cause because the mere possession of drug paraphernalia was not a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.412(1). There was no evidence that defendant had used the drug paraphernalia in a proscribed manner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business owner sued defendants, the city, the mayor, the police chief, the electric company, and the gas company, seeking damages for his economic losses and emotional injuries arising from the termination of utilities to his business while protestors were in the building. The Superior Court of King County, Washington, granted summary judgment in defendants' favor and the owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying action arose as a result of a large, week-long protest where protestors barricaded themselves in the top two vacant floors of the three-story building where the owner's place of business was. The mayor proclaimed a state of emergency in the city and the police ordered the building's gas and electricity disconnected. The owner unsuccessfully attempted to conduct his business while the protestors were still in the building; the owner lost business, which was eventually shut down. On review, the owner contended summary judgment on all his claims was improper. The appellate court found that the takeover of the building by protestors was an emergency and that police had valid safety concerns and reasonably ordered that power to the building be shut down; thus, Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code &sect; 21.49.110(U), absolved the electric company from both contractual and tort liability for interruptions of electrical service due to circumstances beyond its control. The gas company's failure to give notice to the owner as required by it own tariff rules did not make it liable for losses or damages arising from the force majeure, and did not entitle the owner to damages.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was given conflicting information by different people. Plaintiff argued that the trial court erred by granting defendant's motion for summary judgment because defendant was not a bona fide purchaser of the property. The court of appeals agreed. There was clear evidence in the record that defendant received actual notice of plaintiff's unrecorded claim to the property, and sufficient constructive notice to indicate that there might have been some truth to the claim, despite the denials of plaintiff's father. Defendant was placed on inquiry notice and upon inquiry, learned that plaintiff's family could not agree among themselves whether plaintiff had an unrecorded ownership interest or not.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendants stemmed from an executed search warrant on their residence. Defendants challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the possession with intent to manufacture charges. Female defendant argued the trial court impermissibly commented on the evidence, and male defendant argued the charging document for possession of methamphetamine contained an incorrect date for the alleged offense. The appellate court ruled that, considering the totality of the evidence, any rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants possessed the pseudoephedrine tablets in the Mason jar, which was found in a drawer of their bed, with the intent to manufacture or to assist the manufacture of methamphetamine. Also, a propane tank found in the shed held ammonia, and the officers found other components of the anhydrous ammonia method of producing methamphetamine. Furthermore, nothing in the trial court's statement revealed its attitude toward the merits of the case or the witness's testimony, and, by changing the charging date, the trial court did not alter the essential elements of the charge against the male defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Immediately after the mistaken reading, there was an off the record bench conference between counsel and the trial court. Thereafter, the judge immediately acknowledged the mistake and so informed the jury. There was no record of any request by defendant's counsel for a mistrial or a special corrective instruction to the jury. In addition, there was substantial evidence against defendant. Defendant was observed by the victim's landlord attempting to push or pull something out of the victim's front door. When the police arrived, defendant fled. At the point where defendant jumped a fence and fled, a police officer found stacks of electronics and other boxes on the ground. Therefore, defendant was not denied a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to burglary and bail jumping. Defendant had several previous convictions and an offender score of 16 without counting his current convictions. Defendant moved for a drug offender sentencing alternative (DOSA) sentence. The Superior Court of Cowlitz County (Washington) found that his motion was untimely under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the trial court's denial of his motion to modify his 1998 sentence. The appellate court held that the change in the law upon which defendant relied was the legislature's 1999 amendment to the DOSA statute, former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(6)(a) (1996), re-codified as Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.505(2)(a)(viii)). All three divisions of the court of appeals had held that that amendment was not retroactive.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.100(6) did not apply, and defendant's motion to reopen his sentence was not timely as it had been filed over one year from the date of his conviction and sentencing. Even if defendant's motion had been timely, his right to equal protection had not been violated. A statute violated the equal protection clause only if the legislature had no rational basis for creating the classifications it used. Defendant had to have shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislature had no rational basis for applying the 1999 DOSA amendment prospectively but not retroactively, so as to distinguish between: (1) a class of pre-amendment offenders; and (2) a class of post-amendment offenders, which defendant failed to do.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action brought by plaintiff property owners against defendant county in which the owners challenged the imposition of a building moratorium, the Snohomish County Superior Court, Washington, denied the owners' motion for summary judgment and granted the county's motion to dismiss. The owners appealed the orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners applied for a permit for a larger mobile home to replace the single home they had on their property. The county administratively waived the moratorium for the limited purpose of replacing the mobile home with another mobile home of the same size and in the same location. The dispositive issue in this case was whether the imposition of the moratorium was a &quot;land use decision&quot; triggering the Washington Land Use Petition Act (LUPA). The owners argued that the trial court erred in dismissing their claims for failure to bring timely claims under LUPA. According to the owners, the county's decision to impose the moratorium under the Washington Forest Practices Act was not a land use decision. The instant court agreed with the owners. Because the imposition of the moratorium was not a land use decision, LUPA was not a bar to the owners' declaratory judgment action. Regarding the owners' contention that the moratorium violated their right to procedural due process, there was a risk of erroneous deprivation of the owners' property interest because of the procedures used. The trial court also erred in dismissing the owners' claim of inverse condemnation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court reversed the trial court's orders and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the instant court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(4) (2000) (recodified in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.505) of Washington's Persistent Offender Accountability Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sometime after Christmas, the victim's mother learned that her live-in boyfriend, defendant, had earlier been convicted of a sex crime against children. After questioning her eight-year-old daughter, the victim, the mother suspected that defendant had abused her. At trial, the victim testified that defendant had inappropriately touched her. Defendant argued that this sentence was cruel and unusual punishment, and violated his equal protection rights. Defendant also claimed that his counsel was ineffective for failing to interview important witnesses and failing to discredit the victim's story. The appellate court ruled that it found no reversible error. Defendant's sentence was not grossly disproportionate to his crime, as he was a convicted child molester who had molested a child on at least two separate occasions. The legislature was justified in punishing repeat child sex offenders more severely than other repeat offenders, and defendant's sentence fulfilled the legislature's intended purpose and did not violate Washington's prohibition of cruel punishment.</SPAN></P>

He also filed a consolidated personal restraint petition. On review, the appellate court found no reversible error. While defendant claimed the trial court should not have admitted his blood alcohol report without an adequate foundation, defense counsel made only a general objection and failed to preserve this issue for review. Upon testimony of State's witness commenting on defendant's exercise of his Fifth Amendment right not to give evidence against himself, counsel was not ineffective for failure to call for a curative instruction; this was a reasonable decision based on legitimate trial strategy to avoid confusing the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed several motions to vacate a default child custody decree awarding custody to respondents, the mother's mother and stepfather. The King County Superior Court, Washington, denied the mother's motions to vacate and awarded attorney fees to respondents. The mother appealed the orders. Respondents cross-appealed the denial of attorney fees when the mother initially filed her motions to vacate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother claimed that respondents' relief petition envisioned that the child would be returned to her under certain circumstances. However, the mother argued that the custody decree made no provision for the child to return to her and severely limited her visitation rights. The instant court determined that the default order and decree and all subsequent orders were not void. The relief provided did not exceed the request in respondents' petition. Regarding the mother's contention that the third party child custody statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code ch. 26.10, violated her due process because it did not require the appointment of counsel at the State's expense for the mother, the instant court concluded that the statute provided due process to all parents, even though it did not require appointment of counsel for indigent parents. The statute also did not violate equal protection. Because the trial court ruled on the issue of paternity without notice to the child or the opportunity for the child's best interests to be represented by a guardian ad litem, it violated the child's due process rights. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying, then granting, attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's ex-wife received several phone calls from defendant. The calls were loud, and defendant was ranting and raving. He used offensive and obscene language. He was charged with violating the telephone harassment statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.61.230(1)(a). He contended the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad. The trial court denied his motion to dismiss the charge. The State submitted evidence that he previously pled guilty to a harassment crime. The trial court then found that he made the calls using indecent or obscene words or language, that he made those calls with the intent to harass, intimidate, torment, or embarrass her, and that he had previously been convicted of a harassment crime. After defendant was convicted, the appellate court found that the evidence sufficiently supported the conviction. It also found the statute regulated conduct implicating speech, not speech itself, and was not overbroad, as its intent requirement prevented speech protected under the First Amendment from being chilled. Finally, it found the language in the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, as the definitions of the inappropriate conduct were clear.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Juvenile defendant was found guilty in the Superior Court of King County (Washington) of felony harassment, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.020(1). He told a classmate he was going to bring a gun to school and shoot everyone. Defendant claimed he was only joking. The principle argument on appeal was that the evidence and findings were insufficient to support the trial court's conclusion that his statement amounted to a &quot;true threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also challenged the felony harassment statute as unconstitutionally overbroad. The appellate court held that the evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that the threat was a &quot;true threat.&quot; Given the circumstances in which the threat was made, it was reasonable to conclude that defendant's threat would be interpreted by his classmate as a serious threat to kill. The appellate court also held that, because the harassment statute prohibited only &quot;true threats,&quot; which were constitutionally unprotected speech, the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The trial court found defendant knew that he communicated a threat and knew that the communication he imparted was a threat of intent to cause bodily injury. The trial court also found that his threat placed his classmate in reasonable fear that the threat would be carried out. Defendant's threat was made at school in an atmosphere of fear and concern following several highly publicized school shootings. In discussing the objective reasonableness of that fear, the trial court properly focused on the context of the statement and how a reasonable person foresaw that the statement would have been interpreted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the convictions were affirmed, but the case was remanded for resentencing. After resentencing, the Superior Court of Mason County (Washington) denied appellant's post-trial motion for a new trial. Appellant sought review of the resentencing proceeding and denial of his post-trial motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant's trial, the police department fired an investigative officer for dishonesty. Appellant claimed that his conviction resulted from an inherently unfair trial, because he never had the opportunity to challenge the officer for possible dishonesty, an issue he was not aware of at the time of trial. Appellant also claimed that the department of corrections (DOC) was improperly denying him earned early release time. The appellate court found that: (1) the DOC was not applying the former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(4), which had been declared unconstitutional, to deny appellant earned early release time, it was properly applying the reenacted Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(4), which had been transferred to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.505; and (2) the post-trial motion for a new trial was properly denied, because the evidence of the officer's dishonesty would not have materially affected the testimony of the witnesses' that the officer interviewed or the trial outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner was sentenced to prison in 1988, he was eligible to earn early release time, good conduct time, and dayroom privileges without having to participate in stress/anger management classes. The department later adopted a policy requiring inmates to participate in these classes if they wanted to continue earning early release and other credits. After petitioner refused to participate in the classes, the department imposed sanctions, including a loss of earned early release credits. The instant court held that the department's application of the policy to petitioner violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. When the department applied the policy to petitioner, it increased the punishment for petitioner's offense by imposing retrospective punitive sanctions. The policy affected petitioner's substantive right to earn early release credits. The regulation was adopted after petitioner's conviction and required him to satisfy additional conditions to receive the same sentence for that offense. Petitioner's opportunity to earn early release credits changed because he had to satisfy an extra condition to earn the same credits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of King County, Washington, granted defendant's motion to vacate a 24 month sentence enhancement after defendant was charged with vehicular homicide. The State appealed and defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued the trial court improperly vacated on due process grounds defendant's two year sentence enhancement. The appellate court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.5055(11)(a)(v) prescribed that the enhancement did not apply to all reckless driving convictions, only those that resulted from a charge that was originally filed as a violation of DUI. The effect of the statute was to elevate a prior reckless driving conviction to a DUI conviction without any proof. Because the statute did not require any proof of the charge of DUI, it failed to set the minimum constitutional standard required for criminal conviction. Because an unproven charge of DUI triggered, in part, a mandatory two years of incarceration as an enhancement violated due process, the statute was unconstitutional. Defendant's reckless driving conviction alone would not trigger the two year sentence enhancement. A sentencing enhancement could not be based on a mere charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The King County Superior Court, Washington, adjudicated defendant, a juvenile, guilty of felony harassment, based on threatening statements he made to school officials. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that: (1) the criminal harassment statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.020, violated both the First Amendment and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, because it proscribed protected speech; (2) he was denied a fair trial when he was held in restraints throughout his fact finding hearing; (3) the trial court did not address the issue of defendant's subjective intent; and (4) the State failed to prove that defendant's words or conduct placed school officials in reasonable fear. The instant court evaluated defendant's claims of overbreadth by applying federal constitutional law. It concluded that the criminal harassment statute was not overbroad under the First Amendment because the statute proscribed only true threats, which were constitutionally unprotected. The statute also was not void for vagueness. Because defendant had a bench trial, there was no risk of juror prejudice from viewing the restraints. Even though the record did not contain the required factual showing to support the use of restraints, the error was harmless. The evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude that the school officials were subjectively afraid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arresting officer testified that he and several other officers responded to a domestic violence call and observed defendant walking away from the house where the fight was reported to have occurred. The officer stopped defendant and told her &quot;she was not free to leave,&quot; and asked for identification. When defendant opened her purse to retrieve her identification, the officer observed a ceramic pipe. According to the officer, when he asked defendant about the pipe, she &quot;turned and tried to turn from me,&quot; at which time the officer arrested defendant for obstructing justice, searched her incident to the arrest, and discovered the challenged drug evidence. The appellate court ruled that the officer conducted a proper Terry stop and did not exceed the scope of the stop by asking defendant for identification, however, the evidence did not support defendant's arrest for obstructing justice. The appellate court could not say that the evidence was sufficient to persuade a rational, fair-minded person that defendant was attempting to flee, and, without evidence of an attempt to flee, the officer lacked probable cause to arrest defendant for obstructing justice.</SPAN></P>

The city appealed, and the company cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company asserted three causes of action against the city: (1) violation of the company's constitutionally protected right to freedom of contract, (2) violation of the company's right to equal protection of the laws, and (3) tortious interference with the company's business expectancy. The instant court concluded that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the company's claim that the city violated the company's constitutional right of freedom to contract. The company's existing contracts were not impaired by the enactment of the ordinance because the company was not incorporated until two years after the ordinance was enacted. The company's objective was the removal of impediments to new contracts. However, this was not an objective protected by the Contract Clauses of the United States and Washington Constitutions. Although the company contended that the city's refusal to train the company's paramedic amounted to an interference for a wrongful purpose, because the company apparently refused to agree to comply with the ordinance, the city's refusal to train the paramedic was essential to realizing the purpose of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The wife moved under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.24.050 to revise the order's income provisions and transfer payment amount. The Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington, denied appellant husband's motion to strike the revision motion as untimely and entered a revised child support order. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Twelve days after the commissioner entered the modification of child support order, the wife moved under Wash.

Ct. Civ. R. 59(b) after the commissioner's order became a superior court order at the end of the 10-day revision period. The husband argued that under the plain language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.24.050, when the deadline passed for moving for revision, an aggrieved party's only recourse was to seek appellate review. The appellate court ruled that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.24.050 clearly and unambiguously provided the wife 10-days from the date of the commissioner's order to move for revision. Once the 10-days passed, the wife's only recourse for review was with the court of appeals.

The appellate court held: (1) defendant had no privacy interest in the neighbor's garbage can, the investigation did not constitute a search that violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7; (2) although the substance found in defendant's residence was fully processed, a reasonable juror could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of processing methamphetamine or its immediate precursor; (3) in light of the State's clear direction to the jury to rely only on the acts that took place on a single date, a unanimity instruction was not necessary; (4) substantial evidence supported the trial court's determination that defendant's statements to police were voluntary; and (5) the prejudicial effect of another tenant's testimony that she saw defendant cooking methamphetamine a few days before the fire did not outweigh its probative value.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer appealed $ 1,398 per unit school impact fees assessed by the County for the benefit of the school district, which was partially located in the County.

That discretion meant that the amount of fees for comparable units might be different from one jurisdiction to another. The developer failed to show that the discretionary treatment was unconstitutional. The developer also failed to demonstrate that its school impact fees were incorrectly calculated or that unusual circumstances rendered the fees unjust. The County's decision to impose school impact fees of $ 1,398 per unit on the developer complied with Wash. Rev.

The fact that other jurisdictions within the school district used that discretion differently did not render the County's fees invalid. Further, because the developer acknowledged that Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant real estate developer appealed a judgment of the King County Superior Court, Washington, reinstating a $ 1,398 per unit school impact fees assessed by respondent county for the benefit of a school district, which was located partially in the county. A deputy hearing examiner had reduced the fee from $ 1,398 per unit to $ 668 per unit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer argued that the school impact fees were incorrectly calculated and that they were not identical to fees imposed by other jurisdictions within the school district. According to the developer, the $ 1,398 per unit school impact fees assessed to it did not comply with the county's school impact fees ordinance. The developer wanted its fees reduced to zero. The instant court determined that the developer failed to demonstrate that its school impact fees were incorrectly calculated or that unusual circumstances rendered the fees unjust. The method used by the district averaged the available data from each school district within the county which had actual data. This method satisfied the concept of county-wide average as that term was used in the ordinance. The statutes and ordinances at issue in the case gave jurisdictions within a school district the discretion to impose school impact fees on new developments. That discretion meant that the amount of fees for comparable units could be different from one jurisdiction to another. The developer failed to show this discretionary treatment was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The district was awarded attorney fees on appeal following its compliance with the Washington Rules of Appellate Procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor sold a new house to the homeowners. A month later, a water leak developed and the contractor patched a small hole in the foundation, but the leak persisted. After the contractor refused to return their calls, the homeowners hired engineers who recommended repairs of more than $ 150,000. The homeowners sued the contractor and attempted personal service, but found his address for private and business affairs was a private mailbox service. Substituted service was eventually effectuated on the private mailbox agent and a default judgment was later entered. The contractor unsuccessfully sought to vacate the default judgment and appealed. The appellate court initially noted the homeowners exercised reasonable diligence to locate and service the contractor before utilizing the substituted service statute and that substituted service on a private mailbox was appropriate under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.28.080(16). The appellate court held the constitutionality of substituted service lacking actual notice had long been settled and that the numerous requirements set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.28.080(16) demonstrated the method was reasonably calculated to provide notice.</SPAN></P>

The district appealed from the Superior Court of Whatcom County's (Washington) order granting the community association's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To preserve the water quality in a reservoir, the city increased its water rates so it could fund land acquisitions in the watershed. As a result, the water district expected to pay the city about $ 55,000 more per year to purchase water for residents in two of four geographical areas. The association argued, and the trial court agreed, that the water district's decision to pass along the bulk water rate increase to all of its customers, including those who did not receive the water purchased, was arbitrary and unreasonable. The appellate court noted that the operation of utilities was a &quot;proprietary function,&quot; and the appellate court would uphold the water district's ratemaking decision unless it was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. The appellate court held the district's decision to impose a uniform surcharge to cover the increased cost of purchasing bulk water from the city was not unreasonable. Because all residents drawing their water from reservoir would benefit from the land acquisitions financed by the city's rate increase, the water district had a rational basis for concluding that all of its customers should share equally in the cost of the rate increase.</SPAN></P>

Mun. Code 9.36.050 (1989). The apartment complex challenged the city's collection of the ambulance charge from the apartment owners rather than directly from the tenants. The trial court held that the question to be decided was whether the ambulance charge was a regulatory fee or a tax. The appellate court held that the ambulance charge was not an absolute or unavoidable tax as mere ownership of the property was not the basis for the tax. Assuming an excise tax was imposed, this tax was based on the occupancy of the rental units rather than the ownership of those units. No ambulance charge was assessed on units that were empty. The appellate court held that the fee was a valid regulatory fee as it (1) related to a direct benefit or service to the taxpayers, (2) the money collected was used exclusively for the establishment and maintenance of the ambulance service, and (3) there was a direct relationship between the fee charged to the apartment complex and the number of occupied units.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arbitrator denied the purchaser's request for attorney fees because the arbitrator believed that Washington's small claims statutes were unconstitutional in that they denied litigants equal protection under the law. The purchaser argued that he was the prevailing party in the arbitration and that, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.84.250, he was entitled to attorney fees. He further argued that the arbitrator's basis for denying attorney fees was an error on the face of the award and that the instant court and the superior court could correct such error. The instant court agreed with both arguments. The instant court concluded that the arbitrator created a manifest procedural error by sua sponte declaring the small claims attorney fees statute unconstitutional. The arbitrator's refusal to follow the applicable attorney fee statute deprived the purchaser of any adequate remedy other than an appeal to the superior court on the sole issue of the denial of attorney fees. The superior court should have treated the purchaser's request for a trial de novo as an extraordinary writ challenging the arbitrator's refusal to follow the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded to the superior court with instructions that it remand to the arbitrator with directions to determine and award the purchaser reasonable attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that his life sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment, that the POAA violated due process, and that it was an unconstitutional bill of attainder and an ex post facto law. The appellate court ruled that defendant failed to show that the Oregon convictions were constitutionally invalid on their face and the trial court did not error in counting them as criminal history. The appellate court found no other constitutional error. Defendant's repetition of criminal conduct aggravated the guilt of the last conviction and justified a heavier penalty, and defendant's sentence was the same as that for any defendant convicted in Washington of second degree robbery with the same or similar criminal history.</SPAN></P>

The WSP cross-appealed on the issue of preemption, challenging the superior court's decision that the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act, at 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 14501(c), preempted parts of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.55.063.</SPAN></P>

The WSP appointed the company's subsidiaries to tow vehicles on WSP's behalf. Later, the WSP sent a single letter to the company notifying it that the WSP was going to revoke its contract with the subsidiaries. After a hearing was held, an administrative law judge affirmed the revocation. The superior court affirmed. On appeal, the court also affirmed. The company had argued that its procedural due process rights were violated because it was not afforded a pre-deprivation hearing prior to revocation. The court held that an existing appointment was a protected property interest, and that an evidentiary hearing should ordinarily be held prior to revocation. However, the court did not find substantial prejudice to the company because it was afforded an extensive post-termination evidentiary hearing, and because the evidence supported revocation of each subsidiary's appointment. The court held that the Act preempted Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.55.063 as it pertained to consensual towing, but not as it applied to nonconsensual towing, as per 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 14501(c)(2)(C).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee City of Seattle, Washington banned the posting of temporary signs on city owned structures, and in violation of the ordinance, appellant moving company posted numerous signs advertising its service on utility poles throughout the city. The Superior Court of King County (Washington) found as a matter of law that the utility poles and other city owned structures were not a public forum, and the company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the city's anti-posting ordinance violated the Washington Constitution. The central issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that posting on city owned properties, including utility poles, was not a traditional public forum. The appellate court ruled that the portion of a publicly owned pole which was located on or adjacent to a street or sidewalk in the City of Seattle within the reach of pedestrians and which had traditionally been used for posting was a traditional public forum. Since none of the city's cited interests were justified by banning all posting on the portion of publicly owned poles, the ordinance was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. The appellate court ruled that the anti-posting ordinance, Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code &sect; 15.48.100, was facially overbroad in violation Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. The appellate court invalidated as unconstitutional the application of the ordinance to the pole portion of the traffic control devices, utility poles and lampposts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence that the police obtained when they arrested him at his home. According to defendant, his outstanding arrest warrant for failure to appear at a contempt hearing, which arose out of a child support issue, did not support the use of a nonconsensual entry into his travel trailer. Defendant challenged both the arrest and the subsequent searches. The instant court concluded that the police did not unreasonably use the &quot;knock and wait&quot; statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.31.040, under the facts of the case. The officers had a duty to arrest defendant once they knew of the arrest warrant, and there was no evidence of bad faith by the officers. The instant court also concluded that the searches following defendant's arrest were valid. It upheld the search of defendant's trailer under the emergency exception to the warrant requirement. Regarding the search of a boathouse, defendant assumed the risk that his parents, who along with defendant had control over the boathouse, would consent to police entry into the boathouse without his consent, even though defendant was present at the time of the entry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sued appellee ambulance service, police officers, and city in the Superior Court of King County, Washington, for the wrongful death of her son and for civil rights violations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's son died after a confrontation with police officers and paramedics, who were attempting to restrain him while transporting him to the hospital, after he was found disoriented and intoxicated in public. The mother unsuccessfully sued for wrongful death and violations of her son's civil rights. The mother appealed, arguing the trial court incorrectly applied the doctrine of state common law immunity and erred when it denied her individual claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The mother further contended defense counsel's comments concerning an inadmissible coroner's inquest warranted a new trial. The appellate court initially noted the trial court properly applied the doctrine of sovereign immunity and instructed the jury appropriately, and, because the defense applied, her civil rights claims necessarily failed. The appellate court held defense counsel's improper remark constituted a waiver of the error, as it was not so flagrant and ill-intentioned such that it evinced an enduring and resulting prejudice that was not otherwise neutralized by an admonition to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of obstructing a public servant in the Clark County District Court (Washington). The superior court affirmed. Defendant appealed, arguing the charging document omitted language of the necessary mental state. Respondent city argued defendant did not preserve his argument because he did not note a hearing before the trial court to have his demand for a bill of particulars met and did not make such a motion at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer observed defendant driving and knew from previous contact that defendant's driving license was suspended. Defendant would not cooperate with the officer and resisted verbal requests of the officer before finally submitting to arrest. Pro se, defendant demanded a bill of particulars before trial. There was no indication in the record before the appellate court that the prosecuting attorney responded to this demand. The appellate court noted that if a defendant challenged the charging document at or before trial, it construed the document strictly as opposed to a liberal construction where the issue was raised for the first time on appeal. Defendant sufficiently challenged the charging document before trial and was entitled to have the appellate court construe the charging document strictly. The appellate court found the citation omitted &quot;wilfully,&quot; the specific intent required for the offense. Because specific intent was an essential element of the crime of obstructing a public officer, the citation was unconstitutional. Thus, the charging document lacked an essential element even under the less stringent posttrial construction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a trial court order suppressing as evidence a weapon taken from respondent arms instructor by two criminal investigators employed by a county prosecutor's office. The instructor was charged with one count of possessing a machine gun, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.41.190(1), .010(7). He moved to suppress the weapon on grounds of illegal search and seizure under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The investigators attended a weapons instruction course, for personal and not professional reasons, at which the instructor was the primary instructor. The State contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in concluding that the investigators were state agents and that the exclusionary rule applied. The appellate court held that a review of the record disclosed facts indicating that the investigators functioned as state agents. Although they attended the weapons instructor course on their own time, they made known their occupation as criminal investigators. They also threatened the instructor with arrest if he did not turn over his weapon. When one of the investigators called 911 dispatch to request assistance, he identified himself as an investigator in the prosecutor's office. Upon his arrival, the deputy examined the firearm, consulted with his superior, and allowed the investigators to put it into the evidence room at the county. Substantial evidence supported the trial court's findings and conclusions that the investigators were agents of the state and that seizing the rifle was unconstitutional. The trial court did not err in suppressing the illegally seized weapon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cabaret challenged the orders of the Superior Court of King County (Washington) excluding its evidence of lost profits as a sanction for discovery violations and dismissing its damage claim for a lack of evidence, in the underlying action with appellee City of Tukwila. The city cross-appealed from a judgment awarding the cabaret attorney fees it incurred to set aside an injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cabaret argued that there was no discovery violation warranting exclusion of its lost profits evidence and that it could prove its damage claim without expert testimony. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the cabaret's discovery violations were deliberate and substantially prejudiced the city's ability to prepare for trial. The appellate court ruled that the trial court's sanction was not manifestly unreasonable or exercised on untenable grounds. As the cabaret's only expert witness designated to testify to lost profits was properly excluded, and the cabaret's other evidence was not sufficient to support its damage claim, dismissal was proper. In the appellate court's view, the cabaret's assertion that two other witnesses were capable of calculating damages was specious at best, and the appellate court rejected the cabaret's assertion that its business records alone established its lost profits with reasonable certainty. Furthermore, the appellate court ruled that it had no basis on which to disagree with the trial court's award of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sued respondent hospital and doctor after she was dismissed from her position at the hospital. The employee believed that she was fired because she was a lesbian. The employee contended that public employment discrimination based solely on sexual orientation was irrational and actionable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The Superior Court, Whitman County (Washington) dismissed her claims on summary judgment. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended the superior court erred when it dismissed her equal protection claims against both the hospital and the doctor, and her claim against the hospital that its actions violated Washington public policy. The appellate court held that the employee raised material issues of fact with respect to whether the hospital and the doctor were state actors for the purposes of &sect; 1983, and they denied her equal protection under the laws. But the employee did not have a claim based upon public policy, as her discharge did not violate a clear mandate of Washington public policy. On appeal, the hospital emphasized breach of patient confidentiality as the justification for the employee's termination. But, at the time, much of the emphasis was upon her relationship with the doctor and her inability to work with him. The evidence and the inferences from it supported the findings that the doctor refused to work with the employee because she was a lesbian. Those findings supported a conclusion that the hospital adopted and ratified the conduct of its employees as its final policy with respect to the treatment of the employee that was based upon her sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal by the trial court was reversed, and the case was remanded for trial of the &sect; 1983 claims against the hospital and the doctor. The dismissal of the employee's claim based upon public policy was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that defense counsel acknowledged the offender score used by the trial court, effectively treating each of those offenses as equivalent to separate felonies in Washington. Implicit in defense counsel's acknowledgment was the determination that each of defendant's three prior convictions should be counted. Since defendant, through his attorney, virtually conceded that he had an offender score of four, and because the trial court imposed a sentence consistent with that offender score, defendant waived the right to challenge the length and computation of the sentence imposed. Since defendant had not shown that the outcome would have been different had defense counsel not made the admissions and acknowledgments, defendant failed to established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs appealed the order granting summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney, who represented a third party in a lawsuit against the husband, used Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.25.070(2) to obtain prejudgment writs of attachment on plaintiffs' real property. Plaintiffs did not receive notice of the lawsuit or the writs until after the writs had been issued. Plaintiffs alleged that the attorney was liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because he knew or should have known that, absent exigent circumstances, writs of attachment without prior notice and an opportunity to be heard violated their due process rights. The attorney asserted that a release of the third party precluded any claim against him based on the prejudgment writs of attachment. The instant court held that the prejudgment attachment of real property without prior notice and a hearing violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in the absence of exigent circumstances. However, a partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs was not appropriate. In addition to proving that their due process rights were violated, plaintiffs were required to demonstrate that the attorney knew or should have known Washington's ex parte prejudgment writ of attachment procedure was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developers appealed a judgment of the Clark County Superior Court, Washington, dismissing several of the developers' takings-related claims against defendant county. The county cross-appealed the trial court's dismissal of the developers' state law tort claims without prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developers set forth nine causes of action: (1) violation of procedural due process; (2) violation of substantive due process; (3) violation of equal protection; (4) illegal spot zoning; (5) temporary taking; (6) negligence - breach of special relationship; (7) wrongful interference with business expectancy; (8) damages and attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988; and (9) inverse condemnation. The instant court noted that Washington case law supported the developers' position that substantive due process claims involving property rights were independent of the takings claims. Thus, the trial court erred by granting summary judgment on the developers' substantive due process claim to the extent that the substantive due process claim relied on arbitrary and capricious state action. The developers' substantive due process claim was ripe and formed the basis for the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. However, because the developers did not seek a variance, their takings claim was not ripe. The trial court did not err in dismissing the developers' state tort claims without prejudice. The developers' spot zoning claim sounded in substantive due process and equal protection, not tort.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed in part and affirmed in part, and the case was remanded for a new trial. The instant court reversed the dismissal of the developers' substantive due process claim. It affirmed the remainder of the holdings of the trial court with regard to both the appeal and the cross appeal, except for the developers' equal protection claim, which it remanded for the trial court's determination.</SPAN></P>

The instant court concluded that the statute was neither vague nor overbroad as applied to defendant's actions. Defendant failed to prove that an ordinary person would not be on notice that the money laundering statute prohibited borrowing the proceeds of illegal drug activity. When defendant borrowed the money from his drug dealing client, he engaged in what was clearly a financial transaction under both common understanding and the statutory definition of that term. Defendant knew that the money he borrowed was the proceeds of methamphetamine sales. As applied to these facts, defendant's vagueness argument failed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that: (1) the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the amended information charging the sentencing enhancement was not filed until after conclusion of the trial; (2) the trial court erred in denying his request to appoint separate counsel because of an actual conflict between his interests and that of his attorney; and (3) Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435, the statute under which he was convicted, was unconstitutionally vague because a person of reasonable intelligence had no means of identifying the location of the school bus stop in the vicinity of the drug transaction. The instant court held that the trial court did not lose subject matter jurisdiction. The amended information complied with the requirements of Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 2.1(d). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying substitution of counsel, as there was no indication in the record that defendant and his attorney had an actual conflict of interest. The instant court rejected defendant's contention that Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant used three different false identities with matching driver's licenses. She acquired title to four different vehicles using two of these names, bought auto insurance and homeowners insurance under the false names, possessed a social security card in one of the names, and had acquired two credit cards in one of the names. She also managed to buy a home under one of the names. An exceptional sentence was imposed because defendant utilized a complicated scheme to purchase a home and several automobiles with the stolen identities. The appellate court found that: (1) the trial court's evidentiary rulings were proper, (2) the evidence was sufficient for the jury to convict on all three counts of theft of identity, (3) the theft of identity and forgery counts did not constitute the same criminal conduct or violate double jeopardy because they involved three separate victims and the crimes were not the same in law or in fact, (4) the convictions of theft of identity and forgery did not merge because none of the crimes were crimes of degree or lesser included offenses, (5) the sentence imposed was not clearly excessive, and (6) the sentencing statutes were not vague or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his theft conviction for unlawful issuance of a bank check entered in the Superior Court of King County (Washington), asserting that the permissive inference instruction on intent to defraud was unconstitutional and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his bank account records. He also appealed the order granting his motion for a new trial on the theft of a firearm charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to a wholesaler's records, defendant gave it 15 insufficient funds (NSF) checks in return for merchandise. The appellate court noted that permissive inference instructions were unconstitutional, unless it could at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact was more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it was made to depend. In defendant's case, the presumed fact, intent to defraud, more likely than not flowed from the facts proven at trial. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence supporting the trial court's decision to give the inference. Further, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized in a warrantless search of defendant's bank account records, as a person who wrote or passed a bad check drawn on his or her bank account could not have any justifiable expectation that the status of the account at that time would remain private. Finally, the trial court properly granted defendant a new trial on the theft of a firearm because of an error in the &quot;to convict&quot; instruction, and the State could properly choose to retry him for the crime charged in the information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two criminal investigators employed by the county prosecutor's office took a weapon from defendant. The prosecutor's office charged defendant with one count of possessing a machine gun, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.41.190(1), .010(7). The Superior Court of Kitsap County (Washington) granted defendant's motion to suppress the weapon on grounds of illegal search and seizure and dismissed the charges against him. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecutor's employees examined defendant's machine gun when they attended a weapons instructor course on their own time. They believed that the gun had been illegally modified. Defendant claimed that the prosecutor's employee's were acting as state agents at the time they opened his weapon to inspect the interior and later when they seized the weapon, and thus, their actions were tantamount to a warrantless search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment and Wash. Const. Art. I, &sect; 7. The appellate court held that the record disclosed that the two employees functioned as state agents. Inter alia, although they attended the course on their own time, they made known their occupation as criminal investigators for the county prosecutor's office. They also threatened defendant with arrest if he did not turn over his weapon. They admitted telling defendant that he had two choices, either turn the firearm over to them for testing or they would call the sheriff, who would probably arrest him. There was substantial evidence that supported the trial court's findings and conclusions that the employees were agents of the state and that the seizure was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent union conducted a campaign opposing two statewide ballot initiatives. Appellant foundation sued the union, alleging that the union was a political committee under the Washington Public Disclosure Act and had not made the appropriate financial disclosures regarding its opposition. The Thurston County Superior Court (Washington) held that the union was not a political committee. The foundation appealed. The union cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initiatives, which did not pass, would have allowed charter schools and the use of education vouchers. The union, which represented employees in public schools, opposed both initiatives in part with a contribution for the campaign from a national teacher's union which it did not report. The foundation, the sponsor of the initiatives, challenged the definition of political committee and the methodology the trial court used to determine whether the union met that definition. The instant court agreed with the trial court that the union was not a political committee. If the union had been a political committee, it would have had to file detailed reports of all bank accounts, all deposits and donations, and all expenditures, including the names of each person contributing funds. The union was not a political committee as a maker or receiver of expenditures. The trial court correctly held that an organization was a political committee if one of its primary purposes was to affect governmental decision making by supporting or opposing candidates or ballot propositions, and it made or expected to make contributions in support of or in opposition to a candidate or ballot measure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city appealed an order of the King County Superior Court, Washington, which granted attorney fees and costs to respondent property owners, pursuant to Washington's eminent domain statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 8.25.075.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in the case was whether the attorney fee provision set forth in &sect; 8.25.075 applied in the context of drug nuisance abatement proceedings. The city argued that the plain language of the provision restricted the application of the statute to proceedings instituted in a formal exercise of the eminent domain power. The owners argued that the proceeding instituted by the city was in effect a condemnation proceeding because the city was seeking to close the property, to prohibit its use for any purpose for one year, and to give custody and control of the property to the court. The instant court agreed with the city that the attorney fees provision set forth in &sect; 8.25.075 did not apply to drug abatement actions. Even assuming the city was acting as a condemnor in the proceedings, &sect; 8.25.075 did not apply, because in initiating the abatement action, the city was not attempting to acquire the owners' property. The instant court rejected the owners' argument that the fee award should be upheld under a theory of inverse condemnation. The owners never made a claim of inverse condemnation at the trial court level and did not prevail as plaintiffs in an inverse condemnation action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court reversed the trial court's fee award to the property owners.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. There was no requirement of the infliction of physical harm; rather, the infliction of fear of physical harm was sufficient. The record supported the trial court's finding of fear of physical harm sufficient to warrant issuing the protection order. The ex-wife appeared uninvited at the ex-husband's house, pounded on the exterior wall, demanded that the husband's wife come outside, followed the family, and was involved in a physical altercation with the wife. The ex-wife threatened to shoot the ex-husband and his wife and then kill herself. The ex-husband was in fear that the ex-wife would carry out her threats to kill him and his wife.

Similarly, the minimal entry in the original child support order that postsecondary educational support did not apply was not proof of an agreement between the parties that there would be no eventual support. At the time of the entry of the order, the children were too young for the court or the parents to know whether postsecondary support would be appropriate. However, the trial court failed to make findings on the relevant statutory factors under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.19.090, as to how dependant the child was in relying upon her parents for postsecondary educational support. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion by perfunctorily ordering postsecondary educational support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Superior Court of King County (Washington) for indecent liberties by forcible compulsion arising from an incident in which defendant had sexual contact with 15 year old. Because he had a 1985 conviction for statutory rape, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole under the two strikes provision of Washington's Persistent Offender Accountability Act (the two strikes law).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed his attorney was ineffective, as he did not offer an instruction for third degree child molestation as a lesser-included offense of the charged offense of indecent liberties with forcible compulsion and referred to defendant's statements to the police during closing. Defendant argued that third degree child molestation should have been considered a lesser-included offense of indecent liberties, even though the lesser offense contained elements that the charged offense did not, because any time the elements for child molestation were satisfied, the elements for indecent liberties would also be satisfied. The appellate court held that no Washington court concluded that third degree child molestation was a lesser-included offense of indecent liberties with forcible compulsion. Given that lack of authority, the court could not conclude that counsel's failure to request an instruction for third degree child molestation was conduct that fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Defendant's counsel was not ineffective during closing argument. Counsel's theory was supported by the evidence and did not undermine defendant's account of the incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence were affirmed. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a lesser-included instruction, there was no prosecutorial misconduct or evidentiary error. Defendant's prior conviction was properly used as a strike for sentencing purposes, his sentence did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment, and the two strikes law did not violate due process or other constitutional protections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court construed appellant's assignments of error as falling into three groups: those based on the Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative (DOSA) statute and equal protection; those based on clerical error and double jeopardy; and those based on due process rights. The court declined to address appellant's argument that the DOSA amendments, which expanded the class of persons eligible for DOSA sentencing, applied retroactively, viewing it as a well settled issue. The court then found that, as the trial court correctly found, appellant was not eligible for a DOSA sentence, it correctly denied appellant's motion to vacate his sentence, and that, as appellant's motion to modify his sentence was an untimely collateral attack, the trial court also properly denied appellant's second motion as failing to establish grounds for relief. The court further determined that, as appellant's post-conviction relief motions were meritless, the trial court properly exercised its discretion under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8(c)(2) to deny them without requiring a hearing, and thus, did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>

While the corrections officer intervened, defendant struck him on the chest, below the chin, in the nose, and on the side of his neck. Defendant argued the jury was improperly instructed. The following jury instruction was given: if a person intended to assault a particular individual, and by mistake, the assault took effect upon an unintended individual, the law holds that the intent to assault transferred to the unintended individual or individuals as well. The appellate court ruled that, as defendant's specific intent to assault the named victim was neither a statutory nor a common law element of assault, the transferred intent instruction did not create an uncharged alternative means of committing assault. Also, the instruction did not require the jury to presume any element of assault and accurately defined the doctrine of transferred intent. Furthermore, as the State did not need to prove that defendant intended to assault the officer, the instruction provided an accurate statement of the law relevant to the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association argued, inter alia, that the WUTC violated the association's due process rights because each of its members' status as the existing, exclusive ETC for its respective service area was a significant, protected, property interest. The court of appeals disagreed. The plain language of 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 214(e) demonstrated that Congress contemplated more than one ETC for rural service areas.  47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 214(e)(2) did not protect rural telephone companies from competition; on the contrary it gave WUTC discretion to designate more than one ETC in a rural service area. Because exclusive ETC status was not a protected interest entitling the associations members to procedural due process under federal law, the claim of denial of due process failed, and therefore, the WUTC did not err.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the defendant sold cocaine to an undercover officer, other officers arrived and arrested the defendant and his brother.

An investigator interviewed the defendant in his cell and the defendant became agitated and threatened that next time he would start shooting police. Those statements were admitted at trial. The defendant argued that the trial court erred by admitting those statements. The court of appeals agreed. The case presented a credibility contest between the arresting officer and the defendant's brother, who denied that a transaction occurred. The State called no observation officers as witnesses. No buy money was recovered and no additional drugs were recovered. The detail with which the officer described the defendant served to confirm that he saw the defendant that night but did not corroborate that the defendant delivered any drugs to the officer. If the jury believed the brother, the officer did not contact the defendant and thus necessarily did not buy drugs from him. The inflammatory threat evidence invited the jury to convict the defendant because he was a threatening, violent young man.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 9.94A.510(3)), even though there were no bullets for the firearm; (3) because defendant was holding the firearm and admitted he had modified it to shoot from his hip, the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm under Wash.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant challenged the judgment of the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington), which convicted the defendant for felony eluding, a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.024.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court's improper instruction allowed the jury to infer that the defendant had a wanton or willful disregard for the lives or property of others, if evidence of the defendant's driving supported such an inference. The defendant contended that the instruction unconstitutionally created a mandatory presumption and required him to either rebut the inference or concede that element, and thereby relieved the State of its burden of proof. The defendant also claimed that the evidence was insufficient to show that he drove in a wanton and willful manner. The court found neither contention meritorious and affirmed. The appellate court rejected the defendant's jury instruction claim, because the defendant proposed the instruction and thus invited the error. The court also found that the evidence was sufficient to prove that the defendant drove with wanton or willful disregard for the safety or property of others. The testifying police officer described the defendant driving 72 mph in moderately heavy rush hour traffic, changing lanes without signaling, and, while being pursued, forcing cars to give up their right of way to avoid an accident.</SPAN></P>

Although the jury should not have reached the fourth question dealing with less restrictive alternatives unless it first found proof of all the necessary elements for an involuntary commitment, the verdict form did not advise the jury not to answer question four unless it was satisfied that the State had proven the &quot;taken into custody&quot; element. Consequently, the verdict form did not provide conclusive evidence that the jury found that the patient came into custody as a result of conduct in which he attempted or inflicted serious harm upon the person of another or himself. Thus, the trial court erred in giving instruction four. However, because there was other evidence to support the commitment, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's relatives went to the house where he was living to tell the victim's mother that defendant was molesting the victim. Defendant was at home when the relatives arrived. Defendant's cousin called 911 and asked the police to be sent, as a suspected child molester was in the house. The cousin told the 911 operator that they were not going to let defendant leave. Defendant admitted to molesting the girls to his relatives. When the police arrived, defendant was advised of and waived his Miranda rights and confessed to molesting the child. The appellate court held that the absence of police conduct precluded a finding that defendant's confession was involuntary. The family did not become state actors just because the 911 operator said &quot;okay&quot; when defendant's cousin said they were not letting him leave. Defendant's confession to the police was also voluntary, as he was not promised anything in return for his confession or coerced. Because a comparability clause was not included in the two-strikes statute at the time of defendant's prior offense, that offense could not be counted as a comparable strike offense. The court vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review of his forfeiture proceeding, appellant argued that: (1) his forfeiture hearing was untimely; (2) the City failed to prove that he used or intended to use the money for an illegal drug business; and (3) the forfeiture statute,&nbsp;Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A timber company agreed to develop property as a gravel mine and then ultimately donate the land to be held in trust for the county. The project was intended to protect public views and transfer private land to long-term public ownership and timber use. The lower portion of the proposed property identified three improvements within one-quarter mile of a building on the property of one of the neighbors. The county decided that it would wait to determine if the timber company needed to obtain a conditional use permit (CUP) for the proposed mining project. The neighbors originally filed a proceeding under the Land Use Petition Act (LUPA), but later dismissed that action before a decision was rendered. The appellate court held that LUPA provided the exclusive means of review for land use decisions, whether they were quasi-judicial or ministerial. The appellate court found that because LUPA provided an adequate alternative remedy, the case was not ripe for judicial review. The court also reviewed the language in LUPA and held that courts should generally defer to local jurisdictions until a final determination on the use of land was made by the highest body or officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was charged in the Franklin County Superior Court (Washington) with second degree escape.

The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court correctly dismissed the case because he would get more jail time if the escape statute applied, and therefore, his equal protection rights would be violated. The court of appeals disagreed. The defendant's equal protection argument failed because he was not similarly situated to felons who took leave via furlough. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.66.016, a prisoner was not eligible for furlough until the prisoner had served a defined minimum amount of his or her sentence. Even when under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections the secretary could not furlough an inmate until the defined minimum had been served. The defendant had his entire sentence before him when given temporary release by the court for a dentist visit. Thus, his situation and the corresponding deterrents were different. Providing for greater deterrents in perceived higher risk situations was a rational basis for treating escape more severely than failure to return from furlough. That was true even when the escape conviction was premised upon the failure to return from an authorized leave. Therefore, trial court erred in dismissing the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued that the trial court miscalculated his offender score by separately counting pre-July 1, 1986 concurrently served convictions and thus imposed a sentence not authorized by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA). The State conceded that petitioner's offender score should have been calculated at 6, not 10, but it argued that the error could not be corrected due to either a stipulation or invited error by petitioner. The instant court agreed with petitioner and granted his requested relief of remand to the trial court for resentencing. Petitioner's pre-July 1, 1986 convictions were improperly counted separately in the offender score calculation and should have counted as one offense, regardless of whether they were the same or separate criminal conduct. Former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.360(5)(a)(ii) (recodified as Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.525 (2001))had to be applied to correct petitioner's offender score.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, appellant property owners appealed a judgment of the Clark County Superior Court (Washington), which affirmed a hearing examiner's decision denying them a conditional use permit for a convenience store, retail space, and a gasoline station. The convenience store and retail space were eventually approved as a permitted use. Respondent county cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners who owned a parcel of land along a state highway unsuccessfully applied for a conditional use permit to build a convenience store with four double-sided gasoline pumps. The county argued that the owners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by not appealing to the board of county commissioners. The owners argued, among other things, that the hearing examiner incorrectly applied the substantial evidence standard of review and should have applied the deferential common law standard. The instant court held that the trial court properly retained jurisdiction even after it remanded the administrative decision and that the owners were not required to appeal the examiner's remanded decision to the county commissioners. The trial court correctly accepted the examiner's determinations regarding the weight and credibility to be given to reasonable but competing inferences. Substantial evidence supported the decision that a gas station would have been detrimental to and not necessary for the rural community. The examiner did not place too much weight on community displeasure and did not engage in unlawful procedure or act in an arbitrary and capricious manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The county was not entitled to attorney fees on appeal. The owners substantially prevailed in the trial court because the plan for the convenience store was approved, and the trial court remanded the examiner's first decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, appealed a judgment of the King County Superior Court (Washington), which found him guilty for felony hit and run and imposed an exceptional sentence of 24 months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had an extensive history of traffic related misdemeanors and infractions, argued that: (1) the evidence of his use of methamphetamine was not relevant to the crime of hit and run; (2) the trial court erred in imposing an exceptional sentence; and (3) Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120 (the felony sentencing statute) and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.390 (statutory guidelines for imposing exceptional sentences) were unconstitutionally vague. The instant court rejected defendant's arguments. The State's evidence of defendant's drug use prior to the incident was relevant to prove the ultimate issue at trial - that he was responsible for the hit and run; the evidence tended to disprove his version of the events by showing that he had a motive to be driving at the time of the accident and a reason to be on the route where the accident occurred. Defendant's extensive history of traffic related misdemeanors and infractions was a compelling reason justifying an exceptional sentence. Regarding defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the statutes in question, the instant court noted that it had rejected this argument on three previous occasions and declined to revisit it.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.410.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.28.030 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401. At sentencing the trial court determined that defendant's standard range was 30.75 to 40.5 months. Defendant argued it was not clear whether the legislature intended solicitation to be charged under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.28 et seq. or as an offense under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50 et seq. Offenders, such as defendant who solicited a delivery, were subject to a five-year maximum sentence. Offenders who attempted or conspired to commit delivery were subject to a one-year maximum sentence. Defendant asserted that this ambiguity required that the rule of lenity be applied in his favor, resulting in a maximum 12-month sentence. The court ruled that solicitation to deliver was an offense under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.28 et seq., not Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50 et seq. Under the plain language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.408, the expressed legislative inclusion of attempt and conspiracy was exclusive, and the implied inclusion of solicitation was barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the King County Superior Court (Washington), which affirmed his conviction in a lower court for harassment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the &quot;mental health&quot; language in the harassment ordinance. On appeal, defendant argued that the &quot;mental health&quot; means of committing harassment was unconstitutional and that the &quot;bodily injury&quot; means was not supported by sufficient evidence. The instant court noted that while defendant's motion was pending, the Washington Supreme Court held in State v. Williams that a nearly identical harassment statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad to the extent it referenced the victim's &quot;mental health.&quot; In light of Williams, defendant moved for the instant court to reverse. The instant court concluded that because the challenged portion of the harassment ordinance was identical in all material respects to the &quot;mental health&quot; language struck down in Williams, and because the jury's verdict may have rested on that portion of the ordinance, it had to reverse defendant's conviction. However, there was sufficient evidence to support a harassment conviction under the alternative means of threatening to inflict &quot;bodily injury.&quot; Thus, the instant court rejected defendant's contention that the case had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

If a child could relate contemporaneous events, the court could infer the child was competent to testify about the abuse incidents. The trial court found that the girls had demonstrated independent recollection of the time frame in which the rapes occurred, including memories of the house where they lived, the other people who lived there, and their ages. Both girls demonstrated to the court's satisfaction that they knew the difference between telling the truth and a lie, and the consequences of a lie. At the competency hearing, it was not necessary to make them answer questions about the specific acts of sexual abuse committed by the defendant. Because the girls were capable of relating contemporaneous events, the trial court had tenable grounds to find them competent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant alleged that the implied consent statute was unconstitutional as applied to drug cases and argued that refusal to submit to a blood test for drugs may not be referenced in a criminal trial. Defendant also alleged that the driving under the statute did not authorize blood draws based on suspicion of drug impairment. The court of appeals held that: (1) the blood test for drugs was justified under the circumstances of this case; (2) the implied consent statute was constitutional as applied to drug cases; (3) the admission of defendant's refusal complied with legislative intent; and (4) the Washington Supreme Court recently rejected the reasoning in Beigh (a case relied on by defendant), thus, since defendant was given the choice to submit to the blood test or to lose his license and to possibly have his refusal admitted at trial, the trooper had statutory authority to request the blood test pursuant to Wash.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State obtained discretionary review of an order of the Superior Court Spokane County (Washington), which reversed defendant's conviction for being in physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of liquor. The superior court remanded the case for retrial and held the district court erred in declining to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.504(2) .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trooper saw defendant's vehicle, with its engine running and its headlights on, in a Spokane parking lot. The vehicle was illegally parked with its nose on the curb of the roadway. Defendant was asleep in the driver's seat. The trooper awakened defendant, conducted a field sobriety test, and concluded he was under the influence of alcohol. Breath tests later confirmed that conclusion. Defendant claimed he had not driven the car to the parking lot. He claimed that a friend drove him and his car from the bar where they had been drinking to the lot, parked it, and then left them there. The court of appeal held that the superior court clearly was wrong when it stated &sect; 46.61.504(2) provided an affirmative defense, if the vehicle was moved off the roadway. Subsection (2) permitted that defense for a person only if the person had moved the vehicle safely off the roadway. The statute unambiguously required that the person asserting the defense be the same person who moved the vehicle. Because there was no evidence defendant moved the vehicle to the place where the trooper found it, the defense was not available to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Landowners claimed that enforcement of an Environmentally Sensitive Areas Ordinance was: (1) preempted by the Forest Practices Act; (2) unconstitutionally vague; and (3) violated his right to due process and equal protection. Under Everett, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 19.37.010, an action could be undertaken by any person which results in any alteration of an environmentally sensitive area. The appellate court rejected the facial challenge to the ordinance. A person reading &sect; 19.37.010 would not have to guess to realize that the cutting of trees above a creek in an environmentally sensitive area modified the natural environment and therefore constituted a development, alteration, or use that required city approval. Therefore, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. Additionally, the ordinance was not preempted by the Forest Practices Act, and landowners failed to show that the application of it violated their right to due process and equal protection. Attorney fees were properly awarded to the city as prevailing party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued he was unlawfully seized when a police officer pulled over the car in which he was a passenger and ordered him to return to the car when he attempted to leave the scene. He also contended the trial court erred by excluding evidence and testimony relating to a portable breath test (PBT) result that tended to show the absence of alcohol on his breath. Since the police officer was able to articulate an objective rationale predicated on officer safety concerns for seizing appellant, the reviewing court held that the seizure was lawful and affirmed the trial court's order denying the motion to suppress. Further, because appellant failed to present any evidence establishing the PBT's scientific reliability, the trial court acted within its discretion in excluding the PBT evidence and testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of Cowlitz County (Washington) of failing to register as a sex offender. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in convicting him because his counsel was ineffective for failing to call the trial court's attention to case law which supported his position. The court of appeals agreed. Defense counsel should have known of, and called to the trial court's attention, two cases. One of which had been decided nearly a year earlier, the other nearly five months earlier. Each directly supported the defense the defendant was asserting. Prejudice was also shown because the record did not show with certainty why the trial court convicted. Although it might simply have disbelieved the defendant's testimony that he was homeless, in which case there would be no prejudice, it seemed to say in its oral remarks that it thought homelessness was unavailable as a defense because the defendant's failure to register occurred before the effective date of the 1999 statutory amendments pertaining to transients. It would have realized it was incorrect, of course, if it had reviewed the case law. Therefore, counsel was ineffective and the defendant was prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the information and the to-convict instruction lacked the essential element of knowledge. Defendant did not challenge the information's or the instruction's omission of knowledge as an element of unlawful firearm possession at his trial. The instant court concluded that the information was not defective; its included terms &quot;unlawfully and feloniously&quot; sufficed to charge the knowledge element. However, the instant court agreed with defendant that the to-convict instruction was erroneous because it omitted knowledge as an element, and it failed to instruct the jury that the burden was on the State to prove that defendant knew he was in possession of the firearm. The to-convict instruction, coupled with the unwitting possession instruction, displaced the burden of proving knowing possession from the State to defendant. The deficient to-convict instruction standing alone was reversible error in light of the defense that defendant neither possessed nor knew about the firearm. The unwitting possession instruction amplified the prejudice by wrongly placing the burden to prove lack of knowledge on defendant, without the State having first proved knowing possession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sister of two brothers appealed a judgment of the King County Superior Court (Washington), which denied the sister's motion to intervene in her brothers' dependency actions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sister sought to intervene in her brothers' dependency actions for the purpose of establishing a right to telephone contact and visitation with her brothers. The sister argued that the trial court erred in ruling that she did not have a right to intervene in the proceedings under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 24(a)(2). She also contended that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny her motion to intervene permissively. She also claimed a common law and constitutional right to intervene. The instant court concluded that there was no right to intervene under the Washington Civil Rules, the United States Constitution, or the common law. The trial court's refusal to allow the sister to intervene was not an abuse of discretion. The instant court noted that family members other than siblings had significant interests in the dependency actions of children, but did not have a right to intervene, and the instant court saw no reason why the result should be different in the case of a sibling. The trial court's decision to deny intervention because it found that intervention would have prejudiced the interests of the brothers was not manifestly unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant denied that his catch was for commercial purposes, and claimed that his harvest was to be used to feed the 11 people in his family. Defendant stipulated to the facts of the offense at the trial, admitted he did not possess a commercial license to fish, and that he harvested over the limit of geoducks set by the State; defendant did not admit to harvesting the geoducks for resale or other commercial purposes. Defendant argued the commercial fishing statute was unconstitutional, as it created an irrebuttable presumption regarding the commercial purposes element of the offense. The court ruled that because the commercial fishing statute presumed defendant acted for commercial purposes, from the finding that he possessed more than three times the legal limit, relieved State of its burden to prove every element beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This suit involved the city employees' actions in relation to the home owner's installation of a water heater. A special prosecutor filed charges against the home owner after he refused to let the police execute a warrant to inspect his home. The action was not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel, but the summary judgment was affirmed on other grounds. The search warrant was supported by probable cause. The home owner did not have a private right of action for extortion, and he failed to set forth any facts demonstrating an act in the use of the process that was not a proper part of the proceeding. The home owner failed to show any issue of material fact relating to the existence of probable cause. The false imprisonment claim was time barred, and the home owner failed to demonstrate facts sufficient to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The trial court's grounds for dismissal were rejected on appeal; thus the award of attorney fees and damages was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The family and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State seized various personal property that was used in the sale of illegal drugs, and also some bank and retirement accounts. The court addressed whether the procedures mandated by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.505 had been followed. A court's authority to order a forfeiture of property derived solely from the statute. The statute thus provided the exclusive mechanism for forfeiting property allegedly used in drug trafficking. The government was estopped from proceeding in a forfeiture action if it failed to follow statutory procedures. When real or personal property was seized under the statute without a prior adversarial hearing, due process required that such a hearing be held within 90 days. The State argued that the 90-day requirement did not apply when a claimant removed a forfeiture action to a court. There was no logical basis for such a distinction. Because a hearing of some type was required within 90 days, it made no difference for due process purposes in what forum such a hearing was held. The State failed to initiate the hearing process within 90 days. The delay thus violated the family's right to due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant pleaded guilty to drive by shooting and entered an Alford plea of guilty to second degree assault while armed with a firearm in the Superior Court of King County (Washington). The defendant was sentenced to a total of 93 months. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to count his prior juvenile offenses and the two charged crimes as the same criminal conduct in calculating his offender score. The court of appeals disagreed. The defendant's motor vehicle theft, eluding, and possession offenses were not the same criminal conduct because they did not share the same objective intent and they involved different victims. His intent in the theft was to drive a stolen car, while his intent in the possession was to possess drugs. His intent in eluding was to avoid being arrested. His eluding did not further the other two crimes. Commission of one crime merely to escape the consequences of another crime represented a change in intent. Where a defendant had the opportunity to decide to end the criminal incident but went on to commit additional crimes, the later crimes did not further the earlier crimes. Moreover, the crimes had different victims. The theft victimized the car's owner, while possession of cocaine victimized the public in general. The victims of the eluding included the pursuing officers and all of the civilians he endangered through his driving.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant veteran submitted his job application to the respondent board of industrial insurance appeals (Board). The board granted the veteran an interview, but eventually offered the position to another candidate. The veteran sued the board to enforce the veteran's preference established by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 73.16.015. The Superior Court, King County (Washington), granted the board's motion for summary judgment, and the veteran appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The veteran argued that the statute obligated the board to select him for the position over the non-veteran applicant, as by meeting the board's advertised minimum required qualifications of a law degree and membership in the bar, he showed that he had the necessary capacity to discharge the duties of the position. The successful candidate, a non-veteran, also had considerable experience as a lawyer in the field of industrial insurance and, unlike the veteran, had experience as a supervisor. The appellate court held that in order to comport with the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Washington Constitution, the statutory preference applied only where a veteran possessed qualifications that were substantially equal to those of non-veteran applicants. Because the veteran in the case at bar possessed only the minimum qualifications, the trial court properly dismissed the suit. Statutory veteran's preferences were generally held to be unconstitutional, if they afforded an absolute preference for veterans in employment that required special skills and abilities beyond the discipline, loyalty, and public spirit properly presumed to be characteristic of veterans.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee appealed his termination by respondent city to the civil service board (Board), which reinstated him. The employee then appealed the suspension to the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington), requesting that it issue a writ of certiorari to review the Board's decision. The city moved to dismiss the writ, and the superior court granted the motion. The employee appealed the denial of the writ of certiorari to the instant court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the city, and was terminated from his position because of inappropriate conduct, including using racial epithets and profane language. The Board concluded the conduct warranted discipline but, in light of the city's poor management practices, that termination was not appropriate. The employee claimed that the Board violated a binding union contract that required progressive discipline prior to his termination. However his brief to the trial court did not contain the progressive discipline materials the employee claimed were violated. The appellate court noted the Board's review of personnel policy was not considered a judicial function. The only remaining source of jurisdiction for the appellate court, and the trial court in its appellate capacity, was the appellate court's inherent constitutional power. This review was thus limited to a demonstration that the board acted either illegally or in an arbitrary and capricious manner. The Board conducted three hearings that provided both sides an opportunity to present evidence in the matter and the employee failed to demonstrate that the Board acted illegally or in an arbitrary and capricious manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent business owner appealed a municipal court citation for failure to bring non-conforming signs into conformance following a change in nature of the business. By way of discretionary review, the appellant city sought review of the Superior Court of Pierce County ruling that the city's sign ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the City incorporated, the business owner bought a building in which he subsequently leased space to successive retail businesses. The business owner had historically used signs on the property to advertise the businesses. Subsequently the city charged the business owner with violating Lakewood, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 18.45.160(C), for failure to bring the signs into conformance when the nature, name, and ownership of the tenants' businesses changed. The appellate court noted that non-conforming uses were disfavored and were subject to subsequently enacted, reasonable, police power regulations. Further, the city's sign ordinance promoted several public purposes: (1) to increase the effectiveness of individual signs; (2) to control dangerous conflicts between traffic control signs and advertising signs; (3) to promote safety, comfort, and well-being of the users of city streets; (4) to enhance the city's visual character; and (5) to permit and to encourage sign designs responsive to public needs. Finally, the appellate court held the city's sign ordinance was a reasonable regulation enacted to protect community health and safety, and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the superior court holding that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the business owner was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that the trial court had not erred because: (1) the plaintiff's argument that the defective substitute service was cured if the summons was fortuitously delivered by a person who was over the age of 18 and not a party to the lawsuit boiled down to the argument that actual notice was sufficient, but actual notice did not constitute sufficient service; and (2) the defendant's notice of appearance reserved all defenses, she asserted the defense both in her answer and by motion, she alerted the plaintiff that the method of service was a matter of interest to the defense, and she asked for a copy of the affidavit of service, but the request was ignored.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code. &sect; 9A.36.045. He appealed and contended that the court erred by: (1) giving a mandatory presumption jury instruction; (2) allowing testimony that defendant had access to a gun; and (3) denying Mr. Rodriguez's motion for a mistrial after a witness mentioned that defendant had been in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's former girlfriend testified that while they were dating, he showed her a gun and indicated he got it from his brother's room. The appellate court concluded that access to a gun had some relevance in proving the crime of drive-by shooting. However, the relevance of that evidence was limited. The State produced no evidence that the gun was used in the shooting. The relevance of the evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. The admission of essentially character evidence was error. Defendant also argued that the permissive inference language of the questioned jury instruction was unconstitutional. Defendant's evidence consisted of testimony that he was somewhere else at the time of the shooting. Under those circumstances, the inference instruction was a mandatory inference, which violated defendant's constitutional rights. The instruction to which defendant assigned error violated his rights because it shifted the burden of production on an element of the crime from the State to defendant. The error was not harmless because the court was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that any reasonable jury would have reached the same result without the error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of murder for hire and was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term to be fixed by the board. The board set the inmate's minimum term at 312 months, the high end of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.94A. (2000), range. The mutual agreement program (MAP) process for the inmate was ordered in March 2000. By August 2000, when she filed the supplement to her personal restraint petition, the inmate had heard nothing. Sometime before January 2001, the inmate received a draft of the MAP. By the time of oral argument in May 2001, no MAP had been approved. The appellate court found that: (1) the board violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.95.009(2), and its own procedures by imposing a MAP with no time frame; (2) the inmate's accrual of statutory good time before and during the MAP process had to be clarified; and (3) all of the inmate's other arguments, were either not well taken or were moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant claimed that: (1) the seizure of the evidence used against him was unconstitutional; (2) trial counsel's failure to challenge the seizure deprived him of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel; and (3) there was insufficient evidence to support either conviction. In his pro se supplemental brief, defendant claimed the prosecutor improperly commented on his pre-arrest silence and violated an order in limine. The court of appeals addressed only the issues of sufficiency of the evidence and the prosecutor's comments on defendant's pre-arrest silence. The court of appeals held that: (1) it was sufficient to show that defendant had dominion and control of another person's car trunk and the weapon within it; (2) the evidence supported the verdict that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon while manufacturing methamphetamine; and (3) the State tainted the verdict by encouraging the jury to infer from defendant's silence that he knew that the drugs and the gun were in the trunk of the car, and the untainted evidence was not so overwhelming as to establish guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant had been convicted several times of shoplifting at a department store. The store issued a criminal trespass warning that barred her from entering the store for two years. She entered the store within two years and attempted to shoplift some things. The defendant argued that the criminal trespass warning was unconstitutional, and therefore could not support the unlawful entry element of burglary. The court of appeals disagreed and declined to consider the constitutional argument. The defendant also asserted that she entered the store on April 17, 1999, with a good faith belief that the 1997 warning was invalid because a municipal court had previously found a 1995 trespass warning invalid and because of assurances provided by the store's security manager. As part of the trial stipulation, she acknowledged that she received the criminal trespass warning and that the store security manager called two days later and advised her that she was not welcome inside any of the department store's locations. That notice sufficiently advised the defendant that she was no longer licensed, privileged, or otherwise invited to be on the store's property.</SPAN></P>

The co-defendant returned to the officer and gave him heroin. Both defendants were arrested and neither of the defendants had any drugs. The appellate court found that: (1) the prosecutor's closing argument did not violate defendant's presumption of innocence, he just commented on the witness's credibility; (2) there was no incurable prosecutorial misconduct because defendant failed to object or request a curative instruction; (3) the school bus stop enhancement did not violate due process because it provided fair notice of what was proscribed; (4) defendant failed to show good cause for the appointment of new counsel; and (5) defendant failed to show that his counsel was ineffective or that he suffered any prejudice as a result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent department of licensing issued charges against respondent appraiser in connection with two appraisal reports he prepared. A hearing was held, and the administrative law judge (ALJ) issued an order revoking the appraiser's real estate appraiser's license. On review, the director of the department sustained the ALJ's order. On judicial review, the Superior Court of Snohomish County, Washington affirmed the director's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department concluded that the two appraisals about which it had received complaints contained significant errors and/or deficiencies and contained unsupported value assignments. On appeal, the appraiser argued that the department should have been required to prove its case by clear and convincing evidence rather than by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court determined that, as appraiser disciplinary proceedings involved violations of objective standards of conduct, the interests of the license holder and the public would be protected with the less stringent preponderance of the evidence standard. The court declined to disturb the order sanctioning the appraiser for failing to produce one of the contested appraisals; there was nothing in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.140.160(9) to suggest that the appraiser must have acted knowingly or intentionally. Although the court found that some of the director's findings were not supported by substantial evidence, those that were also violated the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and demonstrated a failure to exercise due diligence. Reconsideration of the sanction imposed was warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the director's conclusion that the appraiser violated the Real Estate Appraiser Act and remanded for reconsideration of the sanction imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued that the trial court erred by committing him to DSHS because: (1) he suffered from a mental disease or defect, and he possessed a specific characteristic that precluded him from being an sexually violent predator (SVP); and (2) the offered treatment was inadequate to accommodate his developmental disability, and therefore, it should have civilly committed him under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.05. The court of appeals held that the trial court had not erred because: (1) Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.09 created an alternative civil commitment system for a small but extremely dangerous group of SVPs, and therefore the trial court properly found him to be an SVP; and (2) the record supported the trial court's finding that the defendant met the statutory criteria for commitment as a SVP, therefore, the trial court followed the only commitment procedure that statute provided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A permanent protection order excluding defendant from entering a residence was issued.

He also argued that the superior court commissioner lacked authority to issue a permanent protection order. Defendant failed to establish the protection order's invalidity. The Act's provisions satisfied the two fundamental requirements of due process: notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard by a neutral decisionmaker. Considering the minor curtailment of defendant's liberty and the significant public and governmental interest in reducing the potential for irreparable injury, the Act's provision of notice and a hearing satisfied the inherently flexible demands of procedural due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant land owners applied for a planned unit development (PUD) and an unclassified use permit (UUP) in order to develop their land. Their applications were approved under the Kitsap County, Wash., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 14(a) (1983). The appellees a community organization appealed the approval. The Superior Court of King County (Washington) found for the community organization. The land owners appealed and the organization cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court reversed the county's approval of the PUD on the basis of a court of appeals' decision that was partially reversed shortly after the trial court issued its decision. The court on appeal held that because the trial court's only basis for having reversed the county's approval of the PUD had been trumped, the approval of the PUD had to be reinstated. The court also held that, although the land owners had not applied for a plat subdivision concurrently with their PUD application or at any other time during the approval process their PUD was vested under the terms of Kitsap County, Wash., Interim Zoning Ordinance &sect; 455.100 (1995). Additionally, the Kitsap County, Wash., Zoning Ordinance (1983) did not require that a plat application accompany a PUD application in order for the PUD application to be complete. The organization's argument that common space must be commonly owned also failed. Status as open space was to be determined by use, not ownership according to the definition in the Kitsap County, Wash., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 3(c)(55) (1983). The organization had failed to carry its burden to establish that the county erroneously interpreted its ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, who had been convicted of rape and burglary, argued that the trial court failed to properly exercise its discretion in failing to excuse a potential juror for cause. The instant court agreed, noting that the juror in question candidly indicated that she was a recent victim of rape, the same type of offense as that committed by petitioner. The potential jury stated that because of her past circumstances she would have had a difficult time being impartial. Nothing in the potential juror's responses to the deputy prosecutor's attempt to rehabilitate her through his questions and statements truly indicated that she could in fact lay her bias aside. While the potential juror stated that she hoped she could do so, nowhere in the exchange with the prosecutor did he elicit a statement from her that she could be fair and impartial in light of her experience as a victim of rape. Her original assertions were strong indications of actual bias, bias that could not likely be set aside. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to excuse the potential juror for cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed charges against the defendant for extortion. The Snohomish County Superior Court (Washington), convicted the defendant on two counts of second-degree extortion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim and the defendant lived together for several months before the victim terminated the relationship, and left behind sexually explicit photographs of herself. The victim's neighbors received letters purportedly from her, but sent by the defendant, that introduced her as a porn star, included copies of the photographs, and listed an Internet address. Defendant also sent the victim a letter demanding payment of a debt, for which he had received a default judgment, and stated that if she paid the debt he would be out of her life and hoped it wouldn't be necessary for him to let her neighbors know what kind of a person she was. The court concluded that the defendant's acts were wrongful, and constituted both the tort of defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress; however, the extortion statute did not contain a wrongfulness element. Therefore, the court determined that the extortion statute was impossibly overbroad because it was not limited to wrongful threats and did not include any defenses that would limit its reach; the extortion statute substantially burdened a wide range of protected speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by: (1) denying him overnight visitation with his children without finding misconduct; and (2) ordering him to execute a release giving the mother access to his prescription drug records. The court of appeals held that: (1) the trial court had not erred because the trial court was concerned with the father's current ability to care for the children overnight, considering the medications he took daily and the effect they had on his attentiveness; the court's ruling did not address past misconduct that had now been remedied, but rather, it acknowledged a long history of depression, back pain, and insomnia that necessitated the current and likely continuing use of medications; and (2) the trial court had erred because it made no findings that the mother had any medical training or knowledge that would justify her monitoring the father's prescription usage; without such knowledge, an increase in dosage or change in medication would mean nothing to her, yet would likely be used to create parental conflict.</SPAN></P>

The instant court granted discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that: (1) the ordinance was overbroad because the ordinance did not require that any actual interference with a police investigation occurred; (2) the ordinance was facially vague; (3) the ordinance was vague as applied to him; and (4) the trial court failed to issue a limiting instruction on the proper use of his prior conviction for false reporting. The instant court held that the ordinance was not overbroad. Because the ordinance required actual obstruction of an investigation in progress, the ordinance did not give officers unfettered discretion to limit mere verbal challenges to police action. The ordinance was both content neutral and narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest. Defendant could not challenge the ordinance as facially vague as applied to others unless he could show that it was vague as applied to him. Although the trial court's &quot;to convict&quot; jury instruction was constitutionally deficient, the instant court did not grant relief because defendant invited the error by proposing the faulty instruction.

The instant court held that defendant was not entitled to a full response by the State and that the trial court did not need to conduct a hearing before denying the petition. Requiring a specific response by the State and a hearing upon the mere filing of a petition for writ of habeas corpus would have required all correctional facilities to transport the inmate to a court for a hearing without any regard to how frivolous the petition might be. The instant court declined to read Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.36.100 as requiring the State to submit a legal memorandum in opposition to the petition. The State's failure to file a return in the case did not require remand, as defendant did not demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice from the absence of the return.

The appellate court agreed. At trial, the right against self-incrimination prohibited the State from forcing the defendant to testify. Moreover, the State could not elicit comments from witnesses or make closing arguments relating to a defendant's silence to infer guilt from such silence. Therefore, the prosecution could not use at trial the fact the defendant stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice case against defendant doctor, who delivered a brain damaged baby, plaintiff mother appealed a judgment on a defense jury verdict entered by the King County Superior Court (Washington). The mother also appealed the trial court's denial of her posttrial motions for a directed verdict or a new trial on the issue of informed consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue was whether the doctor failed to obtain the mother's informed consent when he artificially ruptured the mother's membranes in order to attach an electrode for the purpose of internally monitoring the fetus. The mother contended, among other things, that the informed consent statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.70.050, on which the informed consent jury instruction was based, was unconstitutional. She also argued that the trial court erred by giving the informed consent instruction. The instant court held that the mother failed to establish that the objective standard regarding causation in &sect; 7.70.050, which had been adopted by a vast majority of jurisdictions, was unconstitutional. The standard for recovering damages in a lawsuit against a doctor had no bearing on the patient's freedom to choose medical procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original parenting plan provided that the child would spend alternating weeks with each parent. At that time, the residences of the mother and father were close. The father moved to another city to get a job. The trial court modified the plan so that the father's visitation was every other weekend, and provided that when the father was away he could designate his family members to care for the child. The appellate court found that: (1) the trial court's modification of the parenting plan was lawful because it did not interfere with the mother's parental rights in that the father was given the right to designate those members of his family who were authorized to care for the child while he was gone, (2) the adequate cause determination provided no basis for vacation of the modified parenting plan, (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the amendment to the petition, (4) the mother was not awarded attorney fees because she raised no meritorious issues, and (5) the father was properly awarded attorney fees because the mother had been intransigent, and had made the litigation protracted and expensive.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held: (1) that the failure to hold a probable cause hearing within 72 hours did not require dismissal, absent evidence that the failure to hold the hearing adversely affected the outcome of the trial; (2) because the inmate failed to show that the failure to hold his probable cause hearing within 72 hours adversely affected the outcome of his trial, the superior court did not err by dismissing the petition without prejudice and allowing the State to file a new petition; (3) the State's motion to redesignate the remaining portion of the inmate's appeal as a discretionary review proceeding was granted; and (4) the superior court did not commit probable error.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that although &sect; 9A.72.160 concerned private speech, it was not overly broad.

Counsel moved to admit other suspect evidence before the trial began, but made a tactical decision not to renew the motion. Defendant failed to overcome the strong presumption of competence. He also failed to explain why the judge's opinion as to who committed the crime was admissible. The judge's failure to suspect him was irrelevant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In March 1994, the trial court revoked appellant's special sex offender sentencing alternative (SSOSA) because of his failure to make acceptable progress in his sexual deviancy treatment. Appellant did not appeal that order. In October 2000, appellant unsuccessfully moved to modify the order revoking his SSOSA sentence, requesting that the trial court strike the treatment as improperly imposed. Appellant argued that the trial court erred by not removing the community placement condition of treatment. The instant court held that the trial court properly ordered the condition of treatment. When read in the context of appellant's failure to make acceptable progress in his sexual deviancy treatment under his original SSOSA sentence, treatment could only mean &quot;sexual deviancy treatment.&quot; The sentence was valid on its face and appellant's action was time-barred under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090. Although appellant contended that the trial court exceeded its statutory authority by improperly delegating the task of treatment to the Department of Corrections, the instant court found that there was no improper delegation of authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer was walking through a city park. He was aware that the park was an area used by some individuals to consume drugs and alcohol. Through a truck window, the officer observed defendant twice place his hands to his nostrils and snort quickly as if forcing something up his nostrils. The officer also heard defendant say to another person in the truck something to the effect &quot;you can make as much money as you want to.&quot; Concluding that narcotics use had occurred, the officer arrested defendant. When the officer asked defendant what narcotic he had snorted, defendant replied &quot;cocaine.&quot; On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred when it concluded that the officer had probable cause to arrest him. The instant court held that defendant's snorting action was highly consistent with the illegal consumption of narcotics and was not consistent with innocent activity. This was particularly true given that the area was known for narcotics use. The officer reasonably concluded that defendant committed a crime by inhaling illegal narcotics. Thus, substantial evidence supported the trial court's finding that probable cause existed for the officer to arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that the last sentence of Wash. Rev. Code. &sect; 50.20.060, which precluded a claimant from arguing as a defense to disqualification that alcoholism caused the alleged misconduct, was unconstitutional because it violated his equal protection rights. The court of appeals held that the statute was not unconstitutional because: (1) the classification did not involve a suspect class nor threaten a fundamental right; (2) the classification applied alike to all members within the designated class of alcoholics; (3) the legislature had a rational basis for the distinction suggested by the statute; and (4) the classification bore a rational relationship to the purpose of the statute. The employee also argued the record lacked substantial evidence to support the finding that he committed misconduct. The court of appeals held that the record supported the finding because it was established that the employee's presence on the job was important to meet deadlines, his repeated absences adversely affected the employer's interest in having a predictable workforce, and therefore, substantial evidence supported the determination that his absences were harmful to his employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 1985 information stated three means of committing vehicular homicide, but defendant plead guilty based on driving while intoxicated. The affidavit for the search warrant showed that the confidential informant was recently inside defendant's house, saw him with and bought cocaine from him, and the informant had a track record with police. The firearms were found in defendant's house, not on his person. There was testimony that defendant was paying for the house, and the police found two bills and his bank statement addressed to defendant. There was no evidence that any of the firearms were permanently inoperable. The appellate court found that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict the defendant because: (1) a jury could have found that defendant exercised dominion and control over the house where the firearms were found; (2) the issuing magistrate did not abuse his discretion when he determined that the affidavit established probable cause; and (3) the defendant had reasonable notice that the causation element of the 1985 predicate offense was based on driving while intoxicated and defendant suffered no unfair prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that (1) because there was no attempt to serve the board until after the motion to dismiss was made, not only was this not substantial compliance, it was no compliance at all; (2) the worker did not claim she was in fact misled by the statutory language because of her linguistic, socio-economic, or cultural hurdles, as she was represented by counsel before, during, and after the appeal; (3) due process was satisfied, as the statute was not ambiguous about the need to serve notice of the appeal on the board; (4) conditioning judicial review of administrative actions on perfecting the appeal as prescribed did not violate equal protection; and (5) there was no disparate impact because, by providing for attorney fees, the Industrial Insurance Act did not require the average citizen to grasp statutory nuances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Department of Natural Resources (DNR) identified state trust land on Bucklin Hill in Kitsap County (Washington) as property subject to sale because of changes in the surrounding areas. Appellant hospital appealed from a jury verdict in favor of respondent, arguing that the trial court erred in instructing the jury. Respondent cross-appealed the trial court's award of attorney fees. On review, both parties requested the court to analyze the attorney fees award under the lodestar method. The court of appeals affirmed. Under the lodestar method, the court multiplied the reasonable number of hours by the reasonable rate. The party requesting fees was required to provide the trial court with records showing attorney costs. Here, DNR's records failed to show that DNR exercised billing judgment. Based upon these inadequate records and the trial court's unique ability to observe and judge each parties' work, the appellate court could not say that the trial court abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>

During this search, the officers found a substance later identified as crack cocaine in a zip-lock baggie in the inside of the bottom of defendant's pants. On appeal, defendant argued that: (1) the officers did not have probable cause to arrest him; and (2) the warrantless search, conducted at the police station, was an unlawful strip search, and the trial court therefore erred by denying his motion to suppress the cocaine found on his person during the search. The instant court held that the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant for obstruction of a law enforcement officer. The evidence supported the conclusion that defendant acted knowingly in taking action that hindered, obstructed, or delayed the officers. Whether the search during which the cocaine was found was a strip search or a search incident to defendant's arrest, it was lawful. Thus, the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress the cocaine.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that, looked at facially, the voyeurism statute was overbroad. The instant court concluded that the voyeurism statute passed constitutional muster. It was neither vague nor overbroad as applied or facially. The trial court applied the voyeurism statute correctly, as the photographs defendant took were ultimately destined for a pornographic internet web site. Defendant failed to articulate any First Amendment overbreadth argument. Defendant conceded that security camera surveillance and eye-level, arms-length viewing and photography did not constitute hostile intrusions under the voyeurism statute. Only photographing from certain angles was prohibited. Defendant conceded that hypothetical conduct he described, such as openly photographing or romantically gazing at people, was not outlawed by the voyeurism statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant pled guilty to vehicular homicide, hit and run, and driving with a suspended license in the third degree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the defendant argued that the prior convictions had &quot;washed out&quot; due to the passage of time, and therefore the 48 months attributable to the enhancement had to be stricken from his sentence. Defendant claimed that case law and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.360(2) prohibited the prior convictions consideration. The court rejected the defendant's contentions. The statute relied upon by the defendant excluded the prior convictions from being used by the trial court to calculate the defendant's offender score. The trial court did not use the convictions for that purpose. Both Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.94A.310(7), 46.61.520(2) clearly required the enhancement of a sentence for vehicular homicide to occur independently of the calculation of the defendant's standard range sentence and without regard to &sect; 9.94A.360(2). Therefore the trial court did not err in enhancing the defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of King County, Washington, denied the request for an injunction. The supreme court remanded for a hearing, and the animal control manager ordered the dogs be destroyed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dog owner was convicted of owning two vicious dogs after the dogs were found to have bitten pedestrians. The city sought to have the dogs destroyed pursuant to former Seattle, Wash., Mun. Code &sect;&sect; 9.25.030, 9.25.035, and the dog owner sought to stop the destruction of his dogs. The dog owner filed a civil lawsuit against the city pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and for the violation of his constitutional rights. Both claims were dismissed. After much litigation, the dog owner obtained a second appeal. In the instant appeal, the court of appeals held that: (1) the superior court properly rejected the argument that the administrative process initiated by Animal Control in 1998 was ultra vires; (2) the amendment to the municipal ordinance provided no basis to reinstate the dog owner's constitutional claims against the city; (3) the hearing below was consistent with the supreme court's prior mandate and the caselaw; and (4) the dog owner's criminal trial constituted a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, appellant drivers appealed decisions of the King County Superior Court (Washington), which concluded that a driver did not have, pursuant to Wash.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of the drivers argued that a police officer's search of the DOL database absent probable cause or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity violated the expectation of privacy under Wash.

Based on the information from the DOL database, the officers either stopped one of the drivers for driving with a suspended license or cross-referenced a criminal information database and discovered other information sufficient to justify further investigation. The instant court held that Washington drivers do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their DOL records. The practice complained of - i.e., the dissemination of individual licensing information to law enforcement officers - was authorized by statute. There was no evidence that the officers either improperly gained access to the drivers' license records or made improper use of the information after accessing it. The searches of the DOL database were not invasive and the information accessed was not highly personal. There was also no evidence that the officers specifically targeted the drivers for investigation based on their race, gender, physical characteristics, or for any other improper purpose.</SPAN></P>

The order provided that the repossessor could purge the contempt by surrendering the car. The instant court rejected as meritless the repossessor's challenge to the order holding him in contempt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant challenged the judgment of the King County Superior Court (Washington) which convicted the defendant for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver with a school zone enhancement pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the defendant argued that his conviction had to be reversed due to prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments. The defendant also argued that the school zone sentence enhancement in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435 violated his right to due process of law because the location of the school bus stop, which he was found to be within 1,000 feet of at the time he committed the offense, was not readily ascertainable. The court rejected the defendant's contentions and affirmed the conviction and sentence enhancement. The court found that the defendant did not object to the statement he contended was misconduct when the prosecutor made it. Because a curative instruction would have cured any prejudice arising from the prosecutor's remark, even if it were misconduct, the statement did not require reversal. And because the defendant could have readily ascertained the location of the school bus stop through objective means, such as contacting the school district or observing school children waiting for a school bus, imposing the sentence enhancement did not deprive him of due process.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also assigned error to the trial court's failure to remove jurors for bias, to the prosecutor's conduct during cross-examination of defendant, and to evidentiary issues. The instant court concluded that the jury venire selection process complied with a constitutionally sound statutory scheme, and it found no other prejudicial errors. Defendant failed to prove that the court administrator departed from the jury selection statutes or that he was prejudiced by the method used in his case. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to allow non-English-speaking people on the venire panel and to provide interpreters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision of the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington), which applied a deadly weapon enhancement to his assault conviction. Appellant claimed that the 1994 amendment to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.310 was not in effect when he committed the offense and the phrase &quot;any violent offense&quot; was ambiguous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of assault and robbery and was sentenced. He moved for resentencing, challenging the trial court's authority to impose the weapons enhancement on his assault conviction. The court denied the motion and he appealed, contending that the 1994 amendment to the statute, applying the weapon enhancement to &quot;any violent offense,&quot; was not in effect at the time he committed the offenses or when he was sentenced. The appellate court disagreed. The legislative history did not support appellant's argument that the amendment applying the weapon enhancement never became law. The provision of a contingent expiration date clearly indicated that the legislature intended the section to become law before the vote on the tax issue, and the subsequent repeal of the amendment indicated that it was the law when appellant committed the crime. Additionally, the phrase &quot;any violent offense&quot; clearly included first degree assault; thus, the amendment was not ambiguous.</SPAN></P>

The nonprofit corporation challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, King County (Washington), affirming the commission's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonprofit corporation argued that the commission did not have jurisdiction to determine whether it was a telecommunications company. The appellate court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 80.04.015 granted the commission jurisdiction. The court found that substantial evidence supported the commission's determination because it: (1) owned computers equipped with voice cards which were &quot;facilities&quot; as defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 80.04.010; (2) managed the use of its network features which were &quot;telecommunications&quot; as defined in &sect; 80.04.010; and (3) did not operate a private telecommunications system used exclusively by it, but instead offered services essentially identical to the operations of regulated toll providers. The nonprofit corporation claimed that by classifying it as a telecommunications company, the commission violated its constitutional rights. The court found that the question of the character of the corporation was one to be determined by the evidence disclosed in the record, and contrary to its &quot;constitutional claim,&quot; the nonprofit corporation was not being deprived of its ability to conduct business.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the convictions and remanded solely for resentencing on the possession count. The trial court's decision not to continue the pretrial proceedings was not an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness, such that defendant's right to counsel of his choice was not violated.

He sought a license by endorsement under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.130.075 based on his being licensed as a denturist by the Nooksack Tribal Authority on the Nooksack Reservation. The board denied his license. The superior court reversed. On review, the appellate court remanded the matter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw the guilty plea because: (1) new evidence showed his plea was involuntary; and (2) new evidence of improper police interrogation showed a change in the law justifying vacation of his plea. The appellate court found that since appellant filed his motion to withdraw the guilty plea three and one-half years after the judgment became final, appellant's collateral attack of the judgment was untimely unless one of the exceptions under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.100 applied. The court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion because appellant's new evidence consisted of unsupported allegations. In addition, the appellate court held that the trial court was clearly authorized to deny the motion for relief from judgment without a hearing because the affidavits in support of the motion did not contain facts that established grounds for relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Department of Labor and Industries cited appellant for failing to comply with several provisions of the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act (WISHA). The Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals upheld the citations and penalties, and the Superior Court for Spokane County (Washington) affirmed. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent conducted a fatality investigation as required by WISHA. The investigation revealed that appellant violated numerous safety regulations. Each citation listed the relevant inspection dates, cited the regulation involved, and specifically stated what appellant had failed to do. The citations provided appellant with adequate information to prepare and present a defense. The citations complied with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.17.120(1). The citations were timely issued within six months of the start of the investigation. Appellant failed to make a substantive argument explaining why the regulations were vague. The findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (Board) were supported by the evidence. The fact that respondent did not stipulate to jurisdiction had no bearing on whether the Board did in fact have jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. The citations were sufficiently specific to satisfy due process requirements, and the WISHA regulations were not unconstitutionally vague.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners filed suit against respondent city and respondent tavern owner, arguing that the tavern was an illegal, nonconforming use and a public nuisance. The Superior Court of King County (Washington) granted summary judgment in favor of respondents, and the appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants owned a home adjacent to a tavern. They complained to respondent city's attorney and requested abatement of the tavern, but to no avail. Appellants had no standing to enforce the repealed zoning code. The zoning code in effect at the time of suit provided a procedure for establishment of an abatement date. However, appellants never attempted to bring the matter before respondent city's planning commission. This was the sole administrative avenue of relief for a perceived violation of the zoning code. Appellants' claim against respondent city was barred by the public duty doctrine. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on the nuisance claim, because appellants failed to establish that claim as a matter of law. They did not show that the tavern was specially injurious to them as a result of wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Appellants' claims were properly dismissed. Appellants' legal theories were either unavailable to them or unsupported by admissible evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens' groups opposed respondent developer's proposal before the county's hearing examiner and county council. When respondent sought discovery of all documents related to appellants' groups, the groups claimed an associational privilege under the First Amendment. Respondent moved to compel production, and the trial court ordered production for in camera review. In a discretionary review of the discovery order, the appellate court held that there was some probability that the requested discovery would harm appellants' First Amendment rights and that respondent had not shown the materiality of the information or that the information could not be otherwise obtained with reasonable efforts. Therefore, the appellate court reversed the discovery order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was based on angry racial comments and threats he made to a grocery clerk who had refused to sell him beer the previous night when defendant appeared intoxicated. Defendant argued that: (1) the State charged him under an invalid, old law, which the legislature had amended before the incident, and (2) the trial court gave erroneous jury instructions based upon outdated statutory language. The instant court agreed with defendant. The necessary elements for the crime of malicious harassment did not appear in any form in the information charging defendant, nor could the instant court find these elements by fair construction. The information clearly charged defendant under a version of the malicious harassment law that had been significantly amended five years before the alleged offense. Charging defendant with violating an invalid law was a fundamental due process violation. The jury instructions at issue were outdated and did not provide a correct statement of the law regarding malicious harassment. The &quot;to-convict&quot; instruction not only stated the wrong crime, but it also allowed the jury to convict defendant for conduct that was no longer a crime.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed the convictions, holding that the challenged instruction clearly informed jurors that they could find appellant was armed with a deadly weapon only if they also found that he stole a firearm during the burglary and the firearm was easily accessible and readily available for use. The jury was free to make that finding based on the evidence presented, and the instruction contained no unconstitutional permissive inference. Second, there was no ineffective assistance by appellant's counsel, who properly declined to pursue the theory that appellant did not know there were guns among the property appellant was caught stealing. The court reversed appellant's community placement sentence under former Wash. Rev.

The appellate court found that because the landowners' subdivision was located outside of Chelan County's interim urban growth area, the subdivision could not be &quot;urban.&quot; The court determined that the question was whether the findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence, and if they were, whether the factual findings, in turn, supported the legal conclusions. Because the board approved the landowners' plan based on the fact that it was consistent with other previously approved subdivisions, the court remanded to the board to independently evaluate the subdivision, and determine whether it was urban according to the laws in force when the landowners filed their application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, respondents were hospitalized after notice by emergency room (ER) staff that each respondent needed to be evaluated for mental illness. Prior to the 72-hour period prescribed by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.05.150, a county designated mental health professional (CDMHP) petitioned for 14-day involuntary treatment. The King County Superior Court (Washington) granted respondents' motions to dismiss the petitions. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was the timeliness of detention of each respondent by the CDMHP after notice by hospitals' ER staff, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.05.050, that each respondent needed to be further evaluated for mental illness. Respondents also challenged, on due process grounds, the constitutionality of the statute. The instant court held that the six-hour period specified in the statute began to run from the time the ER staff determined that an evaluation by the CDMHP was necessary. The instant court concluded that the statute satisfied the due process challenge made, provided that the State met its burden to justify, by a preponderance of the evidence, any delay between a person's arrival at an ER and the determination by professional staff that it was necessary to notify the CDMHP to take action. The instant court rejected respondents' contention that the six-hour period began as soon as one was either restrained in the ER or no longer required medical treatment. The instant court found no due process violation for four of the cases, and reversed the orders of dismissal as to them, but it found insufficient evidence to justify the detentions in two of the cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court reversed the orders of dismissal as to four of the respondents, but it vacated the orders of dismissal as to the two respondents in which it found insufficient evidence to justify their detentions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father accrued a debt for past due child support since 1995. The father filed suit in 1997 after receiving a license suspension warning letter from DSHS. The superior court granted the summary judgment motion by DSHS. Ultimately the appeal was dismissed, and the court of appeals issued a mandate to the superior court. In 1999, DSHS sent the father another warning letter, and the father filed the instant action. The appellate court held that res judicata barred the suit because: (1) the state's interest in enforcing child support orders would be impaired by varying results across successive suits; (2) the evidence in each suit was virtually the same; (3) the father sought to protect his interest in his driver's license in each suit; and (4) the father challenged the same statute in both suits on identical grounds so the same transactional nucleus of facts gave rise to his claim. The court determined that even if it regarded each warning letter as providing a separate cause of action to make res judicata claim preclusion inappropriate, collateral estoppel barred the father's claim because there was no significant change in the legal climate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was hit by a car immediately after she exited a bus operated by respondent, an independent municipal corporation. She sued respondent and defendant city for damages. The trial court dismissed the claim against respondent, because appellant did not file a notice of claim before initiating her tort action, as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.96.020. On appeal, the appellant argued that she substantially complied with the statute by making a good faith effort to file her notice. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that respondent did not mislead appellant by informing her there was no preprinted form to be used in filing a notice of claim, and strict compliance with claim filing procedures was required. Second, respondent was not estopped from raising the defense of failure to file a claim, as it raised the defense in its answer three months after appellant filed her complaint and five weeks before the statute of limitations extinguished her claim. Finally, appellant was not denied due process; when respondent filed its answer raising the claim filing defense, appellant was on notice that further investigation was required.</SPAN></P>

Since he had previously been convicted of rape of a child in the first degree, he was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole pursuant to Washington's Persistent Offender Accountability Act. On appeal, he claimed multiple trial errors, including incompetence of the child witness to testify, admission of child hearsay, omission of the instruction that appellant was not compelled to testify from the instructions read to the jury, and that it was cruel and unusual punishment to incarcerate him for life. Rejecting his contentions, the court affirmed. The trial court found that the child witness understood what it meant to tell the truth, could relate events that occurred during the molestation, and had the capacity to answer questions about the crime. The trial court appropriately weighed several factors in admitting the child's hearsay statements. Appellant's life sentence was consistent with the seriousness of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants petitioned for a tax refund. The tax was imposed upon the sale, use, consumption, handling, or distribution of tobacco products in Washington. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.26.020(1). The tax was imposed only on distributors, and one of the statutory definitions of distributor was a person who brought, or caused to be brought, tobacco products into Washington for sale. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.26.010(3). Respondent reasoned that appellants caused the tobacco products to be brought into the state when they placed an order with an out-of-state supplier, and because they handled or distributed the products in Washington, they were liable for the tax. The trial court agreed, and granted summary judgment to respondent. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the tax was not an unconstitutional tax against interstate commerce. Under the plain language of the statutes, an in-state distributor was a person engaged in the business of selling tobacco products in Washington whose tobacco products were to be brought into the state for sale. Appellants were responsible for paying the tax, and the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment in respondent's favor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant received a sentence of 120 months for second degree rape. One day before the expiration of his sentence, respondent filed a petition under the Sexually Violent Predators Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.09, in the Superior Court of Mason County (Washington), seeking appellant's involuntary civil commitment. Respondent's petition was granted, and appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent sought appellant's civil commitment as a sexually violent predator, based on diagnoses of sexual sadism and paraphilia NOS (rape). Commitment of a sexually violent predator, under Wash. Rev. Code, ch. 71.09, was not criminal incarceration, so appellant could not raise double jeopardy or ex post facto claims. The legislature could accord fewer due process protections to persons committed as sexually violent predators than to those otherwise involuntarily committed for treatment. To be entitled to the appointment of a second expert witness, at public expense, appellant had to demonstrate good cause under Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 275-156-010(3), and appellant failed to establish such cause. Appellant was entitled to appointed counsel, but, applying the Strickland standards to counsel's effectiveness, appellant failed to show he suffered any prejudice from his counsel's performance due to counsel's failure to raise invalid evidentiary objections or to discover, pre-trial, that his expert agreed with the diagnosis of paraphilia NOS (rape). Counsel's failure to move for reconsideration of the trial court's denial of his request for a second expert was also not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's commitment of appellant as a sexually violent predator was affirmed because such commitment was not criminal incarceration, appellant did not have to be afforded all the due process protections provided others involuntarily committed for treatment, he did not show cause for a second expert witness, and his counsel's representation was effective.</SPAN></P>

Appellee answered, and nine days later, filed an amended answer. The amended answer raised the defense that appellants failed to wait the 60 days required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.96.020(4). Appellee moved for summary judgment, which the court granted, dismissing the claim. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal. Strict compliance with the filing procedures was required. Appellee's rejection of the claim prior to the end of the 60-day waiting period did not amount to a waiver. Although appellants asserted that appellee should have been precluded from asserting the 60-day violation as a defense based on laches and equitable estoppel, they failed to show prejudice, damage, or manifest injustice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted in the district court of driving under the influence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At appellant's trial, the judge refused to provide an interpreter and excluded a prospective juror who had trouble understanding spoken English.

Appellant's motion in limine to exclude all reference to a card he had been given by his attorney outlining what to do in the event of an arrest was denied. Appellant's due process rights were circumvented when the prosecutor asked him what was written on the card. There was no probative value to the information contained on the lawyer's card. The only value of the card was its inference that only a person disposed to drink and drive would take anticipatory steps to avoid self-incrimination. To invite the inference of guilt from the exercise of constitutional rights was impermissible.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the child was competent to testify, as she had the ability to perceive the events at the time they occurred and could relate them truly. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the child's out-of-court statements regarding the sexual assault, as such statements, made by a child younger than 10 years old, was admissible in a criminal proceeding, as the court found that the time, content, and circumstances of the statement provided sufficient indicia of reliability. The trial court did not err in declining to give defendant's proposed jury instruction on alternative means of committing the crime, as defendant failed to demonstrate how his proposed instruction added anything beyond what was contained in the trial court's Petrich instruction.

</DIV>

Respondents challenged the permit decision under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C of the Land Use Petition Act (LUPA). The trial court remanded for completion of an SEIS and reconsideration of the CUP. The court on appeal affirmed the hearing examiner's ruling rejecting respondents' Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.21C.080 of State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), request for two reasons. First, the information respondents relied on did not qualify as new information under the SEPA regulations. Second, respondents' challenge was untimely because they failed to file a LUPA petition within the time allowed by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.21C.080. Respondents did not show a substantial change in the proposal, or an impact previously identified as needing further evaluation. The CUP decision was not based on considerations beyond the hearing examiner's authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hearing examiner's decision approving the CUP was reinstated. Even if the interim agreement qualified as new information, neither the examiner nor the trial court could properly order an SEIS because the issue was time-barred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction of and sentence for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver. Defendant alleged that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied her motion to compel the State to reveal the identity of a confidential informant, that the trial court erred by applying a Wash.

Code &sect; 69.50.435(a)(6) &quot;drug-free zone&quot; sentencing enhancement because the statutory provision was violative of equal protection, and that the trial court failed to recognize it had discretion to order work ethic camp (WEC). The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and remanded for resentencing in order to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion as to whether to sentence defendant to work ethic camp. Disclosure of the identity of the confidential informant was not necessary because defendant had admitted that she sold drugs of the type found in her home. Section 69.50.435(a)(6) applied equally to any offender and did not violate equal protection. The trial court was mistaken in its belief that WEC was unavailable to defendant due to the 1999 amendment to the applicable statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, possession of a stolen firearm, and possession of stolen property. Respondent moved to suppress the evidence in his possession. The Superior Court, King County (Washington), suppressed the evidence on the ground that the police lacked authority to make the arrest which led to the discovery of the evidence, and dismissed the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that the initial detention of the respondent for possession of an open beer container was not legitimate. On appeal, Appellant State argued that the trial court erred by applying a proof by a preponderance of the evidence standard to the officer's initial detention when the appropriate standard is whether there was a reasonable articulable suspicion. The court held that the trial court erred in granting the motion to suppress. The evidence that the a beer was within the reach of the respondent, was cold to the touch, and that an officer detected the odor of alcohol on the respondent's breath was sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe the respondent had committed the civil infraction of possession of the open beer container in public. As a result, the initial stop of the respondent was proper, and therefore police had authority to search the respondent. The officers did not have to have evidence sufficient to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt to possess probable cause for arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed. The court held that because the trial court erred in finding the initial detention invalid, it erred in granting the motion to suppress. The evidence that respondent had possession of the beer was sufficient to allow police to believe the respondent had committed an infraction, and therefore the initial detention was valid. The suppression order was reversed and the case was remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a dark, rainy night, appellant struck a pedestrian dressed in dark clothing, who she did not see crossing the street in the middle of the block.

Appellant contended on appeal that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary understanding would have to guess at the meaning of the term &quot;accident,&quot; and the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. The appellate court found that the term &quot;accident&quot; was unambiguous as applied to the facts of the case. The appellate court further found that the circumstances were sufficient for a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable person in appellant's situation would have known that she had been involved in an accident; therefore the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although appellant raised several claims of error, the appellate court found no prejudice requiring reversal. The trial court did err in deferring to correctional officers regarding the use of shackles, and therefore failed to properly exercise its discretion on the record with an appropriate factual basis. Although appellant was restrained during her trial, there was no indication that the jury saw her in shackles. Due to the overwhelming evidence that supported the convictions, any error in regard to the shackling was harmless. Appellant also failed to show: (1) the trial court erred in sustaining objections to defense questions to her expert witness; (2) error due to impeachment of the expert witness with matters from another case to show bias; (3) a statement by the judge was improper comment on the evidence; (4) manifest constitutional error regarding two jury instructions, to which she failed to object; (5) the jury considered an uncharged offense due to a typographical error on the verdict form; (6) abuse of discretion in how appellant's offenses were counted in calculating her offender score; (7) counsel was deficient; or (8) cumulative error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent department of labor attempted to collect industrial insurance premiums from appellant for temporary workers employed by the appellant pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.16.060. Appellant filed suit alleging the statute unconstitutionally violated procedural and substantive due process. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The Superior Court, Thurston County (Washington) granted the respondent's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it arbitrarily imposed liability on employers for the debts of others. The statute made the appellant statutorily liable for the industrial insurance premiums of temporary workers. The appellant's liability was secondary to that of the temporary help company. Therefore, the court found that the statute was not arbitrary. Appellant also challenged the statute on economic substantive due process grounds, arguing that although the ends the respondent sought to effect were permissible, the means used were unduly oppressive and not reasonably necessary. The court rejected this argument, because the appellant's assertions addressed the wisdom of the statute, not its constitutionality. Because the appellant failed to analyze the Gunwall criteria or to present argument or analysis on the subject, the court declined to consider appellant's due process claims under the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The court found that the statute, which required the appellant to pay the industrial insurance premiums of temporary workers when the temporary help company failed to pay, violated neither procedural nor substantive due process. The statute did not impose an arbitrary liability on the appellant, and appellant's economic due process arguments only addressed the wisdom of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Whatcom County (Washington) Superior Court held that evidence of cocaine found in respondent's car was the result of an illegal seizure. Appellant, the State of Washington, sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was charged with possession of cocaine after an officer asked respondent to step out of his car for a pat-down search. The officer immediately saw a &quot;cook spoon&quot; in the car and, investigating further, found the cocaine. The trial court suppressed the cocaine because the officer's request for identification was made absent any articulable suspicion of criminal activity. The court of appeals reversed, holding a seizure occurred when the officer asked respondent to step out of the car for a pat-down search for identification, and this seizure was reasonable because of the nexus with respondent's admitted criminal activity of driving on a suspended license and the need to properly identify respondent. The officer then saw the cook spoon in plain view. The officer had probable cause to arrest respondent at that point for possession of a controlled substance (the residue on the spoon). Although the officer did not arrest respondent until after the search of the vehicle, the arrest and search were reasonably contemporaneous. Thus, the search did not violate Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7, because it was incident to arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court's suppression of the evidence was reversed. The pat-down search of respondent was reasonable in light of his suspended license and lack of identification; the officer then saw drug residue and was justified in searching the vehicle, and the subsequent arrest was reasonably contemporaneous to the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioned for visitation with respondent's child. The petition was dismissed and respondent was awarded attorney's fees. The case was remanded after an appeal for a determination of whether attorney's fees were warranted on appeal. The Superior Court, Snohomish County (Washington) awarded respondent fees for the appeal, but did not enter any written findings of fact or conclusions of law in support of its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the appellant argued that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to articulate specific reasons for the amount of the award or to enter written findings of fact or conclusions of law to support the award of attorney's fees. Because the trial court failed to develop an adequate record upon which to review the fee award, the court remanded for entry of proper findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the reasonableness of the claimed fees. Based on the extremely limited record, the court could not determine how the trial court concluded that the respondent was entitled to fees, or that the appellant had the ability to pay. The court was unable to determine whether the trial court considered whether any of the fees charged by respondent's counsel were unnecessary or duplicative, or whether the fees were reasonable. Additionally, the court could not determine how the trial court arrived at the amount of fees, particularly in light of the fact that the billing records reflected fees of less than half that amount.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the portion of the fee award awarding respondent fees for the appeal and remanded to the trial court for the entry of proper findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court was directed to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the respondent's financial need for reimbursement of attorney's fees, and appellant's ability to pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with assault in the second degree while armed with a deadly weapon. The jury rejected his theory of self-defense and found him guilty. Defendant appealed, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of no self-defense. He also alleged that the trial court erred by excluding evidence about the victims' possible gang affiliation, by refusing to allow him to recall a witness, and in instructing the jury. The appellate court affirmed. The trial court did not violate defendant's constitutional right to confront witnesses when it refused to permit him to: (1) introduce the portion of a report that referred to &quot;suspected gang members,&quot; and (2) inquire into the victims' possible gang affiliations. Nor did the trial court violate defendant's right of compulsory process and right to a full and fair hearing, including the right to cross-examine witnesses, when the court ruled that comments made to another inmate were inadmissible hearsay. Further, the jury was properly instructed, and the evidence was sufficient to prove the absence of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed, since the lower court did not violate defendant's constitutional right to confront witnesses, right to a fair trial, and right to cross-examine witnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a motion to withdraw her guilty plea to charges of robbery in the first degree with a deadly weapon enhancement, burglary in the first degree, and kidnapping in the first degree. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that it was untimely pursuant to the Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090(1) one-year time limitation for collateral attacks. Appellant challenged that determination, contending that her motion should have been considered as timely filed because it was mailed in sufficient time to ordinarily reach the trial court within the time frame established by &sect; 10.73.090(1), that the trial court should have considered the merits of her motion under the doctrine of substantial compliance, and that equitable tolling should have applied. The appellate court affirmed. As to appellant's mailing related argument, courts did not have the authority to waive statutory limitation periods. Also, filing after a statutory time limit could not be considered to have been actual filing within the time limit. Finally, appellant's situation did not support application of equitable tolling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Seattle, Washington City Council voted to vacate a portion of a street as part of a development project by respondents.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court judgment and administrative ruling affirmed, because (1) the issue was ripe for review; (2) respondent was not required to first obtain environmental review of its larger development proposal; (3) evidence indicated no significant adverse impact on traffic; (4) the review board had no duty to consider alternatives; and (5) respondents were entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was committed as a sexually violent predator under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09. Because recent Washington Supreme Court decisions disposed of most of appellant's claims, and the others presented no reversible error, the appellate court affirmed. Appellant failed to offer any evidence of unlawful discrimination as to his commitment. Appellant failed to show a colorable basis for requesting discovery in support of his selective prosecution claim. Because appellant failed to include his plea agreement in the record, the appellate court could not consider the claim that his commitment was invalid because the plea form was defective. The admission of hearsay evidence at the probable cause hearing did not violate appellant's right to equal protection and due process, or did the failure to close appellant's proceedings to the public violate his right to privacy. The trial court did not err by not considering less restrictive alternatives at the probable cause hearing. Further, appellee State fulfilled its burden of proof at trial, and the prosecutor's comments during closing argument were not improper. Also, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commitment was affirmed. Inter alia, appellant failed to support his burden of proof in establishing his claims of unlawful discrimination and selective prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Skamania County, Washington, Department of Planning and Community Development approved an application to run a mobile home park in a Special Management Area of the Columbia River Gorge, finding that it had been a mobile home park prior to the new zoning rules, and thus was a valid nonconforming use. Respondent neighboring landowner appealed. The Skamania County Board of Adjustment ruled that Washington law required a person seeking to prove that a land occupier had discontinued a nonconforming use to prove that the land occupier intended to discontinue that use. Respondent Columbia River Gorge Commission ruled that the term &quot;discontinued&quot; did not contain an intent element. The superior court affirmed respondent commission, and appellant county sought review. The instant court reversed and remanded to respondent commission. Under the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act of 1986, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 544-544p, and the Columbia River Gorge Compact, respondent commission was required to apply Washington law to resolve the issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted of first degree murder, kidnapping, and robbery; they appealed, and the court affirmed. Use of appellant two's confession did not violate appellant one's confrontation clause rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI, because his name was redacted. The prosecutor's reference to this confession in closing was intended to buttress a witness's credibility, not to implicate appellant one, and was harmless because other evidence was more probative of his guilt. That appellant one was shackled during the trial was not error, and did not prejudice him, as the jury was prevented from seeing this. The state had no duty to preserve the car in which the victim was killed, as it had no reason to believe it contained exculpatory evidence and appellants' claim that it did was speculative. The state's failure to timely make a witness's identity available was not caused by bad faith, and the trial court cured any prejudice by allowing appellants a continuance and requiring the state to make the witness available for interview. Appellant one failed to objection to the trial court's determination of his sentence, so he waived his right to contest the sentence on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Redacting reference to appellant one in appellant two's confession cured any confrontation clause violation as to the former; shackling appellant one during trial did not prejudice him, as the jury did not see this; the state's untimely disclosure of identity and location of its witness did not prejudice appellants; the state did not have a duty to preserve the vehicle in which the murder victim was killed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for second degree unlawful possession of a firearm from the Superior Court of Jefferson County (Washington).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the end of the evidence, the trial court instructed the jury. It did not include &quot;knowing possession of a firearm&quot; as an element in the &quot;to convict&quot; instruction. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. On appeal the court ordered a new trial rather than dismiss with prejudice. Defendant owned the house in which the guns were found. He had lived in the house for more than two years. The guns were kept in plain sight in the gun cabinet. Neither the guns nor the cabinet were locked. Defendant was in the home at the time of the charged possession. Based on these facts, a jury could reasonably have inferred he was in possession of the guns at that time. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts. Defendant's proposed instruction, implying that when two people lived together, only one of them could own and possess firearms found in the house was a misstatement of the law. The occupants of a house could jointly own or possess its contents. Defining &quot;constructive possession&quot; as no actual physical possession, but dominion and control of an item which could be immediately exercised, was an accurate statement of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction reversed and remanded for new trial because an essential element, &quot;knowing possession of a firearm,&quot; was missing from the &quot;to convict&quot; jury instruction. It could have been reasonably inferred that defendant was in possession of the firearms, because, in addition to having access to them and being in close proximity to them, he was an owner and possessor of the premises on which the firearms were found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged her conviction for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia by the Superior Court Walla Walla County (Washington) after her motion to suppress evidence found in her purse pursuant to a bench warrant issued while she was free awaiting sentencing was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to possession and delivery of methamphetamine and was released on bail. While awaiting sentencing, the trial court issued a bench warrant for appellant's arrest based on the prosecutor's affidavit that she had been spending a lot of time with a known drug user. While executing the bench warrant, police searched appellant's purse and found controlled substances and paraphernalia. Appellant's motion to suppress was denied and she was convicted for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia. The court affirmed. Because appellant had been adjudicated guilty of a felony and had been released pending sentencing, the trial court could authorize the bench warrant based upon a well-founded suspicion, rather than probable cause, that a probation violation had occurred. Information from appellant's child's grandmother and officers, one of which reported another probationer's information, taken together provided the well-founded suspicion. An alleged statement that someone &quot;had a surprise for&quot; appellant in regard to the contents of her purse, was hearsay, in that appellant sought to prove by it that the speaker had placed the drugs there.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction was affirmed. As appellant had been found guilty of a felony and been released pending sentencing, she had a diminished right to privacy and the trial court could issue a bench warrant based on well-founded suspicion, taken from information provided by three individuals, rather than on probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.82.903 repealed certain portions of the Criminal Profiteering Act so that they were not in effect when defendant committed the acts leading to the charge of leading organized crime under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.82.010(14)(p) (1995), former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.82.010(15) (1995), and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.82.060. The attempt by the legislature to continue the Criminal Profiteering Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9A.82, by repealing Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.82.903 was unconstitutional because it violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 by not expressing the subject in the title, and embracing more than one subject. It was determinative that the title of the repealing legislation did not inform even the most intelligent, astute reader that the effect of the bill was to continue the life of the Criminal Profiteering Act and to continue to criminalize leading organized crime. Thus, the title did not fairly apprise the legislature and public of the substantive consequences of the legislation, and it violated the subject-in-title mandate of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed in part, affirmed in part. Legislation meant to retain previously repealed portions of Criminal Profiteering Act was unconstitutional. Conspiracy jury instructions were proper. There was sufficient evidence for conspiracy conviction. Defendant's counsel was competent. Because State dropped delivery of controlled substance charge before trial, related sentencing enhancement should not have been submitted to jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to one court of delivery of cocaine and one count of possession of cocaine.

The prosecutor refused to support the application. The trial court declined his request for conditional release for deportation because of appellant's recent prior conviction and other considerations. The trial court then sentenced appellant to 36 months on the count of delivery and 6 months on the count of possession, to be served concurrently. Appellant sought review contending that the trial court abused its discretion, and that the statute was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, Franklin County (Washington) which granted summary judgment in favor of respondent county based on res judicata, release, and statute of limitations. Appellants' claim related to the state's decision to upgrade a highway which appellants claimed was inverse condemnation. A settlement was reached with the state on the issue several years previously.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, husband and wife, bought a mini-mart on a section of road which became affected when the state department of transportation upgraded the highway and limited access points to selected intersections. The state filed an eminent domain action. Pursuant to a settlement agreement, the state paid appellants who dismissed their appeal, and stipulated that they had no right to compensation. Two years later, appellant filed an action against respondent county for constructive reverse condemnation. The appellate court affirmed the granting of summary judgment to respondent. Due to the earlier action, issue preclusion, not res judicata, applied. There was a final judgment on the merits, that there was no taking and no right to compensation. The facts and issues constituting appellants' claims against respondent county were identical, except that the term inverse condemnation was not used in the prior complaint. Thus, appellants' claim was precluded. The three-year statute of limitations under the Administrative Procedure Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.52.195, did not apply as appellants had no administrative cause of action against respondent county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment was affirmed because issue preclusion applied as appellants fully litigated the issue of whether the placement of highway access constituted a taking of his property rights or value and whether he was entitled to compensation. Appellants did not have an administrative cause of action, thus, the three-year statute of limitations did not apply. Appellants' remaining issues were not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, Spokane County (Washington), which granted respondent corporation's motion for dismissal on charge of violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.44.100, for hiring outside of the state during a lockout. The trial court declared the law unconstitutional as it violated the supremacy clause's preemption principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent corporation was charged with violating Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.44.100, for allegedly recruiting or securing employment of out-of-state workers to work at its plant during a lockout. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the complaint. Section 49.44.100 was unconstitutional as it violated the supremacy clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, because it was federally preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq. By curtailing an employer's right to hire replacement workers, &sect; 49.44.100 attempted to regulate conduct that was intended to be left unregulated. Such restrictions were prohibited under the Machinist doctrine. Further, neither preserving industrial jobs for state residents nor preventing violence were express policy considerations of &sect; 49.44.100. Although appellant State had an interest in preventing violence and maintaining employment for its residents, &sect;49.44.100 by its plain language did not expressly provide for these interests. Moreover, even with this statute in place, employers could still hire out-of-state replacement workers themselves. Thus, the State interest exception did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the trial court did not err when deciding that the strikebreaker law was unenforceable as barred by federal preemption, as it involved an impermissible extension of state regulation into areas that had been left under the control of free play of economic forces. Further, it did not meet any of the exceptions to forestall preemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother shared joint legal custody of her son with her ex-husband. When the child's father died, respondent, the decedent's sister and the child's paternal aunt, filed for and was awarded nonparental custody of the child. Appellant filed an appeal. The appellate court found that the trial court improperly addressed the issue of parental unfitness. Under the Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 26.10.030, the allegation of parental unfitness should have been addressed as a threshold jurisdictional issue as early in the nonparental custody proceeding as practicable. The appellate court found that not only did the court delay to the detriment of both the mother and son, but that the proof of unfitness was insufficient to support the court's order, whether the standard was clear, cogent, convincing or compelling or by a preponderance of the evidence. There court concluded from the evidence in this record that appellant lost custody of her child because she tried to defend the integrity of her family unit against state intervention that was unfounded in the first place because it was based on a petition containing allegations of parental unfitness that ultimately proved to be false.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the custody order and remanded for dismissal of respondent's custody petition, for prompt return of the child to appellant's care, and for determination and award of attorney fees to appellant, finding that an otherwise fit parent could not be found unfit because she chose to fight a nonparental custody petition, and openly expressed her dislike and distrust of those who brought and supported it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants claimed their adult offender scores should not have included points for juvenile convictions. In 1997, the legislature amended Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.030 to include all prior juvenile adjudications. Prior to 1997, appellants' juvenile convictions automatically washed out when calculating an adult offender score. The legislature specifically provided for retroactivity of a 2000 amendment to clarify an ambiguity present in the earlier revisions to the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA). The relevant version of the SRA to be applied in imposing a sentence was the law in effect when the current offense was committed. Sentencing court properly counted juvenile convictions when calculating adult offender scores. Appellants did not have a vested right to exclusion of juvenile convictions from adult criminal history. Use of juvenile convictions did not violate due process or ex post facto principles. Juvenile convictions did not have to be excluded based on bargains reached in juvenile pleas.</SPAN></P>
