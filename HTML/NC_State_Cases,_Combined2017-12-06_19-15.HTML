<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, decedent's estate and wife, filed a federal complaint against defendants, state highway patrol and state officials, alleging violation of decedent's federal constitutional rights and related state claims. The court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant on plaintiffs' federal claims, and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs' pendent state claims. Plaintiffs sued defendants in state court, alleging violations of state constitutional rights and wrongful death. The trial court granted defendants' motions to dismiss. The court found plaintiffs' claims were timely filed because the period of limitations was tolled under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1367(d). Plaintiffs' claims against defendant official in his official capacity were improperly dismissed because there was no adequate remedy provided by state law. Plaintiffs' alleged state constitutional claims against defendant official in his individual capacity were properly dismissed because North Carolina did not recognize actions for damages against individuals for violation of state constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed in part because the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred plaintiff's wrongful death action; judgment reversed in part because plaintiffs' claims were timely filed and plaintiffs' claims against defendant official in his official capacity were improperly dismissed since there was no adequate remedy provided by state law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was granted a new trial on both charges and again found guilty. Defendant was sentenced to consecutive prison terms of life without parole for the murder and 42-60 months for the assault. Defendant filed an appeal of his conviction and sentence. Affirming, the court held the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing evidence regarding defendant's statement that he had gotten into some trouble. The trial court determined prior to admitting the testimony that the statement was relevant and that the probative value outweighed any danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. Further, it was not improper for the prosecutor to argue that defendant's decision to carry a loaded gun supported the inference that defendant anticipated in a possible confrontation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of being a habitual felon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his habitual felon conviction, on the grounds that the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment for insufficiency of the evidence. His motion to dismiss was grounded in the argument that the statutory creation of a prima facie case in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-7.4 shifted to him the burden of proof in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V. and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Specifically, he argued that the same name presumption contained in that statute violated his rights to due process. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-7.4 did not shift the burden of proof to defendant on the issue of identity in violation of defendant's due process rights. Clarifying that the statutory prima facie case merely created a presumption that allowed the jury to decide whether the state had proven the elements of the crime, the court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that there was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's conviction in light of the same name identity presumption contained in N.C.

Affirming the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss, the court emphasized that the statute in question merely created a presumption that allowed the jury to decide whether the state had proven the element of identity.</SPAN></P>

After appellee's arrest, he was received at the detention facility at 6:15 a.m. The magistrate ordered appellee to be held without bond because of &quot;domestic violence,&quot; and set the case for bond hearing at 1:30 p.m. Appellant appeared before the district court judge at approximately 1:30 p.m. on May 8, 1998 and was released after a $ 500 unsecured bond was set. In September 1998, appellee was indicted for habitual misdemeanor assault based upon five prior misdemeanor convictions, four of which were assault on a female. Trial court dismissed the charges stating that appellee's procedural due process rights to a timely pre-trial release hearing were violated. Judgment reversed.

N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant judicial retirement system suspended plaintiff retired judge's retirement benefits after he was appointed to another state office. The appellate court concluded that plaintiff forfeited his monthly benefit when he served in another state office because the prohibitions in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 135-3(8)(d) (1994) existed when plaintiff's rights vested in the retirement system and the prohibition applied to plaintiff under the terms of the statute. Defendants' interpretation of the statutory provision did not violate plaintiff's constitutional rights because plaintiff did not have a property interest in his retirement benefits while he was employed in another state position and all retired employees were subject to the same provisions. Although the trial court erred in admitting an affidavit into evidence that was not served prior to the day of hearing, the error was harmless because the trial court would likely have reached the same result without the affidavit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Cabarrus County Superior Court (North Carolina), which determined that defendant had not been placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense when he was convicted and sentenced for possession of cocaine and assessed a drug tax, and denied defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession with intent to sell and deliver cocaine, and resisting a public officer. He was determined to be an habitual felon. His appeal was denied. He was then assessed a drug tax. Defendant argued the trial court erred by not following precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit which found North Carolina's drug tax ( N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-113.105 et seq. (1999)) to be a criminal penalty, and thus impermissibly placing him in double jeopardy. Petitioner had no appeal of right from the trial court's order. The court held no appeal lay from an order made in a habeas corpus proceeding instituted under N.C. Gen. Stats., ch. 17 by a prisoner to inquire into the legality of his restraint. The remedy, if any, was by petition for certiorari addressed to the sound discretion of the appropriate appellate court. Accordingly, defendant's appeal was dismissed. The constitutionality of the assessment and collection of the drug tax had been previously upheld. With the exception of decisions of the United States Supreme Court, federal appellate decisions were not binding upon either the appellate or trial courts of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeal dismissed. The assessment and collection of the drug tax was not an unconstitutional violation of double jeopardy and federal decisions were not binding on North Carolina courts.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-134.6(b)(6), which subjected their retirement benefits to state income tax. Defendants, state agencies and officers, filed a N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the class action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and a petition for judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that plaintiffs' complaint should be dismissed because plaintiffs were not vested in either a local governmental employees' retirement system or a teachers' and state employees' retirement system when the General Assembly enacted &sect; 105-134.6(b)(6). Plaintiffs argued that a contractual relationship was formed between themselves and the State when they began their employment. Thus, the State's post-hiring attempt to change the taxability terms of their retirement benefits was an unconstitutional impairment of contract and deprivation of property without due process. Upon review, the court followed established precedent and concluded that the contract between plaintiffs and the State did not form until they became vested in their retirement benefits. Thus, they did not have a contractual right to rely on the terms of their retirement plans prior to their vesting dates. Plaintiffs failed to state a claim for violation of the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. As there was no contractual obligation, they failed to state claims for due process violations under the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendants had violated both; thus, the local corporation filed a motion for attorneys' fees pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 75-16.1 and 66-154.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The local corporation sought attorneys' fees of $ 1,752,135.90 from defendants following the court's order, which found that defendants violated the UDTPA and the TSPA. The court held that the local corporation suffered an injury in North Carolina as a result of defendants' unfair competition which had a substantial effect on its domestic operations. At the time of the injury the foreign corporation was doing business in North Carolina, and its actions were part of a coordinated business plan which involved activity in other states as well as North Carolina. The burden on interstate commerce arising from the application of North Carolina's UDTPA and its attorney fee provisions was not excessive in relation to the interests of the state; furthermore defendants waived any such defense by failing to raise it until the post- trial motion for attorney fees. Therefore, the local corporation was entitled to $ 1,200,000 in attorneys' fees based upon the time expended by counsel, their skill and experience, the complexity and difficulty of both the factual and legal issues in the case and the results obtained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's counterclaim against plaintiffs alleged that the non-termination and option provisions of the merger agreement between plaintiffs constituted a breach on the part of one bank's board of directors of the fiduciary duty owed its shareholders and that the other bank aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty and that the provisions restrained trade. Plaintiffs sought to dismiss the counterclaim. The court held that North Carolina law applied to the merger because North Carolina had a significant relationship because plaintiffs were headquartered in North Carolina. Additionally, any injury defendant suffered as a shareholder of one bank was by virtue of the fiduciary agreement, which was governed by North Carolina law. Under the applicable North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, defendant did not have a cause of action because N.C.G.S. ch. 75 did not apply to the sale of securities. Therefore, defendant could not challenge the merger on antitrust grounds under North Carolina law.</SPAN></P>
