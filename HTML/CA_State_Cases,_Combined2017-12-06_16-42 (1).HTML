</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory relief action involving the certification of nonpublic, nonsectarian schools, the Los Angeles County Superior Court, California, entered a judgment of dismissal in favor of defendants, the California Superintendent of Public Instruction and the California Department of Education. Plaintiffs, an association that represented 182 schools and a school that alleged it was adversely affected by the Department's practices, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the Superintendent could not suspend or revoke the certification of a nonpublic, nonsectarian school providing educational services to disabled children without providing a hearing with proper notice before any adverse administrative action could be taken. The court concluded that Ed. Code, &sect; 56366.6, subds. (a) &amp; (b), and Cal. Code Regs., tit. 5, &sect; 3068, did not on their face violate plaintiffs' federal and state due process rights. The governmental interest at stake, the education and protection of disabled children, was the type of interest that permitted the suspension or revocation of a certification of a nonpublic, nonsectarian school without providing a hearing prior to the Superintendent taking action. Defendants had a compelling interest in ensuring that such schools were operated in a safe and lawful fashion. Plaintiffs' as-applied challenge failed because their complaint identified no specific controversy as to how the statute or the regulation had been applied to a single nonpublic, nonsectarian school. The suspension and revocation procedure did not violate the requirements for emergency action specified in Gov. Code, &sect; 11460.10 et seq.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an association that provided medical marijuana and an individual, appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which, after sustaining defendant city's demurrer without leave to amend, dismissed a complaint asserting declaratory relief and civil rights causes of action challenging an ordinance that imposed criminal penalties for the operation of a medical marijuana dispensary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint requested a declaration that state medical marijuana laws preempted the ordinance, Anaheim Ord. No. 6067, ch. 4.20, &sect; 4.20.030. The trial court instead concluded that under the supremacy clause, U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2, federal law preempted the medical marijuana laws. The court held that the Medical Marijuana Program Act (MMPA), Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 11362.7 through 11362.83, did not amend the Compassionate Use Act (CUA), Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11362.5; thus, Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11362.775, authorizing medical marijuana cooperatives, did not contravene Cal. Const., art. II, &sect; 10, subd. (c). The complaint adequately pled a request for a declaration of rights under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1060, and factual issues precluded resolving the state law preemption issue on demurrer. The Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. &sect; 812 et seq., did not preempt either the CUA or the MMPA under the limited scope of preemption described in 21 U.S.C. &sect; 903 because there was no conflict and the city had no power to enforce federal law. The civil rights cause of action was properly dismissed because the Unruh Act, Civ. Code, &sect; 51, did not apply to enactment of legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order sustaining the city's demurrer to the civil rights cause of action, reversed the judgment of dismissal, and reinstated the declaratory judgment cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendant California Secretary of State, seeking an order declaring Proposition 140, which imposed lifetime term limits for state legislators and other state officers, void in its entirety, and declaring that Proposition 140 effected a revision to the California Constitution. The Los Angeles County Superior Court, California, granted the Secretary of State's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court concluded that the Secretary of State's motion for judgment on the pleading was properly granted. The question of whether Proposition 140 amended or revised the state Constitution was decided by the California Supreme Court in Legislature v. Eu, which held that Proposition 140 amended the state Constitution. Although plaintiffs characterized their challenge as an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge to the initiative's constitutionality, they alleged no particularized injury that, as applied to them in particular, deprived them of a right. Plaintiffs did not challenge a particular interpretation or application of the initiative; instead, plaintiffs sought to invalidate the entire proposition based on their allegations that it revised the state Constitution. While plaintiffs alleged they had more conclusive evidence than that presented in Eu, that evidence was irrelevant to determine whether it appeared from the face of the initiative that the initiative necessarily and inevitably changed the basic form of government. Nor did the existence of additional evidence relating to the role of the legislature transform a facial attack on the initiative into an as applied challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cybercafe owners sought a preliminary injunction against defendant city, contending that portions of a city ordinance infringed free speech and privacy rights protected by the First Amendment and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2. The Superior Court of Orange County, California, enjoined the city from enforcing the ordinance. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chief of police advised the city manager of the growing number of cybercafes in the city, and he identified crime allegedly associated with the cafes. The city acted quickly, establishing a moratorium on the cafes and imposing operating restrictions. The city enacted an ordinance requiring the cafes to obtain conditional use permits (CUPs). The appellate court was of no doubt that the First Amendment was implicated. The city's zoning administrator had unfettered discretion in deciding what conditions to impose when issuing a CUP. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in preliminarily enjoining enforcement of this portion of the ordinance. The appellate court noted that a daytime curfew restriction in the ordinance also limited the ability of minors to communicate on the internet. The appellate court agreed that the restriction was content neutral and passed constitutional muster. The ordinance also required certain staffing requirements. The appellate court concluded that the staffing requirements were not substantially broader than necessary. Finally, the trial court abused its discretion when it enjoined the video surveillance requirements of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order preliminarily enjoining the enforcement of the CUP requirement was affirmed. The trial court's order preliminarily enjoining the enforcement of the daytime curfew; regulating the number of employees, and requiring security guards during certain hours; and requiring video surveillance systems was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 11379.6(a) and of doing so with respect to a substance containing methamphetamine that exceeded three gallons of liquid by volume, Cal. Health &amp; Saf. Code &sect; 11379.8(a)(1). The Superior Court of the County of Lake, California, imposed a sentence that included a three-year term for the volume enhancement. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court gave a jury instruction that permitted a true finding even if the substance containing methamphetamine, a solvent, had not yet been used in the manufacturing process. Defendant argued that the instruction exceeded the scope of &sect; 11379.8 and that the volume enhancement applied only to a substance produced during manufacture. The court disagreed and concluded that the volume enhancement applied to any substance containing methamphetamine that was produced, used, or to be used in the process of manufacturing methamphetamine. Defendant's interpretation of the statute imposed too limited a meaning for the phrase &quot;with respect to.&quot; The underlying offense contemplated that a conviction could result even though production was interrupted before all of the substances gathered by a manufacturer and necessary to produce a final product had been utilized; &sect; 11379.8 was interpreted in a similar fashion. Further, &sect; 11379.8 was not unconstitutionally vague; the plain language, statutory intent, and cases interpreting the underlying offense provided notice. The court held, however, that the trial court mistakenly believed it lacked discretion in imposing the enhancement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the refiling provisions in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 803(g) would retroactively reopen the case at issue and divest the judgment in the case of finality under law in existence at the time of judgment, and this violated separation of powers. Legislation permitting a judgment to be reopened could apply if, but only to the extent that, such legislation was already in effect when the prior judgment was entered or finally upheld. The prior dismissal was entered or finally upheld when one version of &sect; 803(g) was in effect, but the reinstituted complaint complied only with a later version which included a 1997 refiling provision which became effective after the prior dismissal was entered or finally upheld. Use of the later law constituted an impermissible retroactive attack on a judgment constitutionally subject to reopening only under the earlier law. The 1997 refiling provision could not be retroactively applied to allow the refiling of charges that had been dismissed, at both the trial and appellate levels, before the 1997 provision became effective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Riverside County, California, quashed a search warrant for a storefront medical marijuana dispensary and dismissed criminal charges against defendants, who operated the dispensary, based on in part on its finding that the dispensary was a legal &quot;primary caregiver&quot; under the Compassionate Use Act (CUA) and the Medical Marijuana Program Act (MMPA). The People appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it was error to quash the search warrant and dismiss the charges against defendants. The dispensary did not qualify as a primary caregiver, within the meaning of Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 11362.7, subd. (d), 11362.5, subd. (e), because there was no evidence that it had an existing, established relationship with its customers, in which it provided for housing, health, or safety independent of the administration of medical marijuana. Further, the facts stated in the warrant affidavit provided probable cause that defendants were engaged in criminal activity, and, even if the search warrant lacked probable cause, the affiant acted in reasonable reliance on its validity. The facts included that purchasers summarily designated the business owner as their primary caregiver; there was no evidence they were actual members of a cooperative or collective; at least some of the marijuana for sale was purchased from an outside source, as opposed to from a dispensary member; and a belief that the dispensary was not operating as a nonprofit enterprise was supported by the large number of transactions, the price of the marijuana, and the cash-only nature of the business.</SPAN></P>

Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 354.6 and whether the statute was unconstitutional because it impermissibly infringed upon the federal government's exclusive power over foreign affairs and because it violated due process by allowing claims that arose long ago outside California.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real party in interest slave laborer, a former Korean national and current United States citizen, sued in a California court under &sect; 354.6 to recover compensation for unpaid labor and personal injuries suffered while enslaved in a Japanese labor camp during World War II (WWII). The corporation moved for judgment on the pleadings contending, among other grounds, that the laborer's claims against it were barred by the Treaty of Peace With Japan, Sept. 8, 1951, 3 U.S.T. 3169, T.I.A.S. No. 2490. The trial court denied the motion. Subsequently, a federal district court decided a similar case brought under &sect; 354.6 and concluded the statute was unconstitutional under the foreign affairs doctrine. The corporation filed a second motion for judgment, which the trial court also denied. Then, the corporation filed the petition with the appellate court. The appellate court concluded that &sect; 354.6 was valid because (1) no federal treaty or other law preempted it, (2) the enactment posed at most merely an incidental or indirect effect on foreign countries, (3) the statute did not violate constitutional due process, and (4) the claims it allowed did not present non-justiciable political questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Riverside Superior Court (California) issued an order compelling petitioner county to arbitrate unresolved compensation issues for county probation department employees as provided by Cal. S.B. 402 (SB 402). The county filed a petition for a writ of mandate asking the appellate court to order the superior court to set aside its order compelling arbitration and enter a new order denying the union's motion to compel arbitration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county argued that SB 402 was invalid under the California Constitution because it: (1) delegated to a private body the power to interfere with county money and perform a municipal function in violation of Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11(a); and (2) impinged on the county's power to provide for the compensation of county employees under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1(b). The appellate court granted the writ of mandate because SB 402 was invalid under both constitutional provisions. SB 402 delegated to a private body, the arbitration panel, the power to control or interfere with county money. SB 402 empowered the panel to choose which compensation package, between the two last best offers, the county budget would have to fund. The appellate court rejected the union argument that should the arbitration panel chose its last best offer, the county could opt to reduce staffing levels to keep compensation within the amount budgeted by the county. The appellate court found SB 402 did interfere and the statewide concern exception was not applicable. SB 402 removed from the county the authority to set the compensation of public safety employees that was expressly given to it by the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court issued a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to set aside its order compelling arbitration and enter a new order denying the union's motion to compel arbitration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, inmates who were serving life terms for murder, challenged parole denials. The Superior Court of Santa Clara County, California, granted habeas corpus relief, finding Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, &sect; 2402, subd. (c), to be unconstitutionally vague as applied, and directed the Board of Parole Hearings to develop a training program and to give the inmates new parole hearings once a court-approved regime was in place. The Board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal concluded that the superior court erred in finding &sect; 2402, subd. (c), to be vague as applied. In evaluating how the parole regulations were applied by the Board, the superior court failed to construe the regulations as a whole. For the inmates and the superior court, it was enough that the Board characterized most or all of the commitment offenses in 2,690 parole hearing transcripts examined by an investigator as &quot;especially&quot; heinous, atrocious or cruel. Conceding that this was a linguistically illogical approach, the salient question remained whether, in finding an inmate unsuitable for parole, the Board failed to demonstrate how all the applicable regulatory factors interrelated to support a conclusion that an inmate was currently dangerous to society. The superior court's orders did not answer that question because the inmates' evidence was limited to calculating how often the Board characterized the commitment offense as &quot;especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.&quot; If the Board cited any reasons for denying parole, apart from the commitment offense, those additional reasons were ignored and were not recorded on the charts offered into evidence by the inmates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders granting habeas corpus relief and remanded the matters to the superior court for consideration of the merits of the individual writ petitions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former employees sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Sixth District (California), which affirmed a trial court's order granting the second motion for summary judgment filed by respondents, three officers of the employer, in the employees' action alleging certain injurious misrepresentations and false promises by the officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the original motion for summary judgment filed by the officers and the employer. More than a year later, the officers again moved for summary judgment based on the same law and evidence. The court of appeal concluded that, although the second motion violated Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect;&sect; 437c(f)(2) and 1008, the trial court had inherent power to exercise its constitutionally derived authority to reconsider the prior ruling and correct an error of law. The court disagreed, holding that the trial court erred in granting an impermissible motion. The statutes limited the parties' ability to file repetitive motions but did not limit the trial court's ability, on its own motion, to reconsider interim orders and correct its own errors. To be fair to the parties, if the trial court was seriously concerned that one of its prior interim rulings could have been erroneous, and thus that it might want to reconsider that ruling on its own motion, it needed to inform the parties of this concern, solicit briefing, and hold a hearing. Then, and only then, would a party be expected to respond to another party's suggestion that the trial court should reconsider a previous ruling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner father and real party in interest mother were the parents of three children. The mother sought pendente lite awards of attorney and expert fees based on her needs and petitioner's admittedly very high income. Respondent family court ordered petitioner to pay a total of $ 83,265 in attorney and expert fees. Petitioner made no payments and respondent court found petitioner in contempt. Petitioner filed for a writ of habeas corpus. The court of appeals denied the writ, holding that petitioner's ability to pay had already been determined by respondent court in making the order underlying the contempt. The ability to pay was not an element of the contempt, but rather inability to pay was an affirmative defense. Second, the contempt proceeding was criminal in nature, and while a mandatory presumption could not be utilized to find an individual guilty of criminal contempt, respondent court properly utilized a permissive inference of knowledge of the court's interim order in determining petitioner's guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition, concluding that the family court properly utilized a permissive inference of knowledge, rather than a mandatory presumption, in determining petitioner's guilt. Petitioner's ability to pay the support was not an element of the contempt finding; petitioner could have asserted inability to pay as an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. XVI, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Notice of the validation actions was published in various newspapers, but no answer to the complaints was filed. The agency filed ex parte applications for entry of default judgment, conceding that the schools were pervasively sectarian but arguing that the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for the benefit of the schools did not violate federal and state constitutional restrictions on governmental activity in connection with religious institutions. The trial court denied the applications on the ground that the conduit financing necessarily involved financing of religious indoctrination. The court observed that Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 870(b), which restricted appeals when there was no answering party, did not prevent the agency from appealing and was applicable only to nonanswering parties who did not appear in the trial court. The court affirmed the judgments, holding that under the plain language of Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 5, which prohibited public help to support or sustain a sectarian-controlled school, the bond financing proposal was unlawful. Where schools were pervasively sectarian, conduit financing had the direct and substantial effect of aiding religion.</SPAN></P>

California could not unilaterally amend the compact by mandating the use of the double-weighted sales apportionment formula in Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 25128, subd. (a). The compact expressly required that taxpayers be allowed to elect its apportionment formula. Depriving the taxpayers of that option would violate the constitutional prohibition in U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, and Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 9, against impairing the obligation of contracts and also would violate the reenactment rule of Cal. Const., art. IV, &sect; 9, because there had been no amendment and reenactment of the option. Course of performance evidence as to other states' amendments was irrelevant. There was no surrender or suspension of taxing powers under Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 31.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) challenged a judgment of the Superior Court San Francisco County, California, awarding respondent foreign limited liability company (LLC) a refund of amounts paid pursuant to the levy imposed by Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, former &sect; 17942, which was a levy on LLCs registered to do business in California, as well as an award of attorney fees under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1021.5, and the common fund doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that former &sect; 17942 was unconstitutional because the levy was measured by the LLC's total income, regardless of whether the income derived from or was attributable to business within the state. The court held that former &sect; 17942, as applied to the foreign LLC in the years in question, violated the federal Commerce Clause and that the foreign LLC was entitled to a refund. The levy more closely resembled a tax than a fee. The FTB failed to demonstrate any nexus between the levy and the expense of any regulatory program. The fact that the levy was based on non-California income, not attributable to activities in California, amounted to extraterritorial taxation. The court concluded that Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 19717, was not the only provision by which a party in a tax refund action could recover for its attorney fees. The FTB failed to establish that the requirements for an award of attorney fees under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1021.5, were not met. The common fund doctrine did not apply. Given the absence of explanation in the trial court's order, the record before the court did not provide adequate support for the trial court's upward adjustment of the lodestar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment with the exception that the order awarding attorney fees and costs was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pensioners contended that they were entitled to unlimited cost of living adjustments (COLAs) despite an amendment to Gov. Code, &sect; 68203, imposing a cap. The court held that although Gov. Code, &sect;&sect; 75032, 75033.5, 75076, entitled the pensioners to receive a percentage of the current salary for active jurists holding the same judicial office, the pensioners were not exempt from changes in the underlying salary structure for active jurists. Allowances for some judicial pensioners had been temporarily exempted from the cap on COLAs only to the extent salaries for some active jurists had been temporarily exempted from the cap. The complaint included years when no temporary exemption applied; however, denying leave to amend was error because exhibits showed that some alleged underpayments had occurred during the protected period. A previous judgment that was purely declaratory made no final, enforceable determination of rights under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 577, and thus did not trigger the limitation period of Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 337.5, subd. (b). As to amounts accrued and unpaid at the time of a pensioner's death, Gov. Code, &sect; 20164, subd. (a), provided no limitation period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of leave to amend, remanded with directions to grant leave to amend, and otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff security company appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) granting defendant county's demurrer and dismissing a declaratory action. The court held that Los Angeles, Cal., County Code ch. 2.203, which precluded the county from contracting with companies that did not pay their employees for at least five days of jury duty, was not an invalid regulation and did not violate Cal. Const. art. 11, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county advised the company that its proposal to provide security services would not be considered because it failed to comply with Los Angeles, Cal., County Code ch. 2.203. The security company claimed that Chapter 2.203 was invalid because it was preempted by state law and it impermissibly exercised legislative power outside of the county's boundaries. The court held that Chapter 2.203 was an exercise of the county's contracting power rather than its regulatory power, thus the doctrine of preemption did not apply. The court concluded that Chapter 2.203 did not violate Cal. Const. art. 11, &sect; 7 because there was no evidence that the county was attempting to enlarge its powers or regulate outside its boundaries under the guise of seeking bids for security services, but rather was simply specifying the type of employer with which it wished to do business. Also the county was acting as a market participant, not a regulator. The court noted that the remedies available under Los Angeles, Cal., County Code ch. 2.203 for a contractor's failure to certify or false certification of jury benefits provided were purely contractual and had effect only within the territorial boundaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state workers, filed a petition seeking declaratory and other relief, alleging the Career Executive Assignment (CEA) program violated the civil service provisions of Cal. Const., art. VII, &sect; 1. Respondent personnel board and department opposed the claims. The Superior Court of Sacramento County, denied the petition and the workers timely appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state workers claimed that the CEA system resulted in unlawful temporary appointments, appointments not based on merit, and appointments not subject to the general civil service system. The appellate court agreed with the lower court that the CEA system, in general, did not contravene the &quot;merit principle,&quot; reinstate a spoils system, nor result in illegal temporary or permanent appointments, and did not transgress the general system requirements of the California Constitution. However, since Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 19889.3 required a ranked examination for consideration of the relative merits of the competitors, a regulation stating otherwise, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, &sect; 548.40, violated the implementing statutes. Further, because a non-CEA employee could not transfer into a CEA position without a competitive examination under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 19889.3, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, &sect; 548.96, which provided to the contrary, exceeded statutory authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court modified the lower court's decision, to hold the two regulations as in excess of statutory authority, and as so modified, affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed suit claiming inverse condemnation, denial of substantive and procedural due process, and civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 by defendant city's Mobile Home Rent Review Commission. The trial court granted their petitions for writ of administrative mandate, dismissed the administrative proceedings, and awarded damages. The California Court of Appeal, Fifth Appellate District, affirmed. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over three years, plaintiffs, mobilehome park owners, sought to increase rent, but defendant city's agency caused numerous delays and made burdensome requests for additional information. The state supreme court held that (1) the unreasonable administrative costs and attorney fees imposed on plaintiff could be the basis of a &sect; 1983 claim if the costs were part of defendant's effort to deliberately flout established law, or if plaintiff suffered confiscation due to the costs; (2) to prevail on a &sect; 1983 claim, plaintiff had to show the rent permitted was confiscatory and that relief via a writ of mandate and a Kavanau adjustment was inadequate to establish an average reasonable rate of return; and (3) defendant could not arbitrarily exclude the reasonable expenses of seeking legitimate rent increases in calculating a fair return on investment. The trial court erred in its method of determining the existence and extent of the supposed substantive due process damages, but the supreme court declined to declare the appropriate rent ceiling or to recalculate damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded for the trial court and to the agency to consider, inter alia, whether: (1) the allowed rent ceilings were reasonable; (2) an adequate Kavanau adjustment could be made, and if so, how much; (3) the administrative expenses were imposed in deliberate violation of the law; and (4) plaintiffs used the available legal machinery to prevent injury.</SPAN></P>

The Santa Clara County Superior Court (California) found true the allegation that defendant had a prior conviction for violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422 and doubled defendant's sentence pursuant to the Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect;667.5(c), 1192.7(c)(38), 667(b)-(i), and 1170.12 of the Three Strikes Law. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422, for threatening lives in a domestic dispute, before violation of that provision was added to the list of crimes covered by the Three Strikes Law. On appeal, defendant claimed that he was improperly sentenced under the Three Strikes Law, because &quot;terrorist threat&quot; as contemplated in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422 meant only threats politically or ideologically motivated aimed at society as a whole or the government. The court rejected defendant's interpretation. The court reviewed the legislative history of &sect; 422 and noted that &quot;terrorist threat&quot; had been revised to &quot;criminal threat.&quot; The court also noted that &sect; 422 was amended and reenacted, adding it to the Three Strikes Law, through the California Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, which had the purpose of making every person secure and protected from fear, intimidation, and physical harm. Cal. Proposition 21 amended the Three Strikes Law by adding Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1192.7(c)(38), which referenced &quot;terrorist threats in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422.&quot; Nothing in the voter pamphlet indicated that it was the voters' intent to take a narrow view of &quot;terrorist.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff gasoline company appealed a judgment of the Sacramento County Superior Court (California) in favor of defendants, the State Board of Equalization and the State Department of Health Services, in plaintiff's tax refund suit. The trial court found the fee plaintiff paid pursuant to regulations under the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act of 1991, Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 105275 et seq., was a legitimate regulatory fee and not a tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that, for the fee to be constitutional, it had to be proportional to the gasoline industry's responsibility for cases of childhood lead poisoning, rather than proportional to the industry's responsibility for environmental lead contamination. The court disagreed, holding that a regulatory fee was not an unconstitutional tax under Cal. Const., art. XIII A, if there was a reasonable basis in the record for the manner in which the fee was allocated among those responsible for paying it. There was a reasonable basis for the Department to allocate the childhood lead poisoning prevention program fee in the manner it did, based on the gasoline industry's responsibility for contaminating the environment with lead. The Department was not obligated to allocate the fee based on responsibility only for those specific instances in which exposure to environmental lead contamination had actually resulted in childhood lead poisoning. Plaintiff did not identify any significant contributors to environmental lead contamination who were not allocated part of the lead program fee. The Act did not require the Department to periodically review and revise the fee allocation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit submitted the question of whether under state law the official proponents of an initiative measure possessed the authority to assert the State's interest in the initiative's validity, which would enable them to defend the constitutionality of the initiative upon its adoption or appeal a judgment invalidating the initiative, when the public officials charged with that duty refused to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that, in a postelection challenge to a voter-approved initiative measure, the official proponents of the initiative were authorized under California law to appear and assert the State's interest in the initiative's validity and to appeal a judgment invalidating the measure when the public officials who ordinarily defended the measure or appeal such a judgment declined to do so. The court found it essential to the integrity of the initiative process embodied in Cal. Const., art. II, &sect; 8, that there be someone to assert the State's interest in an initiative's validity on behalf of the people when the public officials who normally asserted that interest declined to do so. The official proponents of an initiative (in light of their unique relationship to the initiative measure under art. II, &sect; 8, and the relevant provisions of the California Election Code) were the most obvious and logical persons to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed an action to enjoin enforcement of defendant charter city's nuisance vehicle abatement ordinance. The Superior Court of Sacramento County, California, granted summary adjudication of a single cause of action for declaratory and injunctive relief, finding the ordinance unconstitutional. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the city could dilute the procedural protections accorded by state laws, particularly Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 11469 through 11495, and Veh. Code, &sect; 22659.5, to those who forfeited the vehicles they allegedly used to facilitate prostitution or various drug transactions. The court held that because the state laws fully occupied the fields of vehicle forfeiture involving prostitution and drug transactions, areas of statewide concern, they preempted the city's nuisance ordinance that, unlike state law, allowed proof by a preponderance of the evidence, did not require a criminal conviction, did not protect innocent owners of the vehicle, and provided none of the guidelines to ensure the proper utilization of the laws permitting the seizure and forfeiture of property, pursuant to Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11469. The ordinance was not exempt from careful scrutiny merely because the city had styled it as nuisance abatement rather than forfeiture. Vehicular solicitation of prostitutes, it would seem from the emergence of nuisance ordinances, was, as the legislature impliedly found, a matter of statewide concern.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;1367.25; Cal. Ins. Code &sect;10123.196. The California superior court refused the injunction, and petitioner sought a writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a California public benefit corporation associated with the Catholic Church. Under the Act, California employers who provided insurance coverage that included prescription drugs were required to cover prescription contraceptives. Petitioner contended that this violated the religious freedom guarantees of both the United States and California constitutions. Petitioner conceded that it did not qualify for the religious employer exception, as it served people of all faiths, and its employees came from a diverse group of religious faiths. The court of appeals concluded that it was not reasonably probable petitioner would prevail on the merits. The statutes, which were enacted to eliminate discriminatory insurance practices that had undermined the health and economic well-being of women, were otherwise valid laws neutral with respect to religion, and therefore required intermediate scrutiny. Because the statutes had a secular purpose, did not advance or inhibit religion, and did not foster excessive government entanglement with religion, the incidental effect of the statutes on religious beliefs did not violate constitutional religious guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a quick-take eminent domain action commenced by petitioner condemner against real party in interest property owner, the California Court of Appeal, Fourth District, Division Two, granted the condemner's petition for a peremptory writ of mandate and directed respondent trial court to set the date of valuation as the date the condemner deposited probable compensation in court. The owner sought review, challenging the date of valuation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In October 2000, the condemner sought to condemn approximately 30 acres of vacant land. On December 15, 2000, the condemner deposited $ 1.789 million in court as probable compensation for the property pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1263.110 et seq. The trial court, which granted the condemner's application for a prejudgment order for possession, determined that the property should be valued as of the date trial commenced - December 6, 2004. However, the instant court concluded that the property was to be valued as of the date the condemner deposited the probable compensation, which was December 15, 2000. Although the owner argued that it was necessary to invalidate the statutory date of valuation in this case, no credible reason existed to invalidate the statutory date of valuation when the deposit was made before trial and the owner had access to the money at that time. The condemner had a right to immediate possession and made a deposit of probable compensation. The owner had the right immediately to withdraw that deposit. The existence of conditions on withdrawal on the owner's statutory right to further litigate the legality of the taking did not deny it just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a city and its city council and officials, appealed judgments from the Superior Court of Shasta County (California), which, in two lawsuits brought by plaintiff organizations challenging the constitutionality of an ordinance regulating handbills and a policy that restricted leafleting outside the public library, granted preliminary injunctions against the enforcement of the challenged provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city limited leafleting to a small area outside the library's doors, required a permit to use the area, prohibited placing leaflets on cars in the parking lot, and prohibited solicitation and offensive speech. The court held that the trial court properly found the outdoor areas of the library to be a traditional public forum under both the First Amendment, U.S. Const., 1st Amend., and the liberty of speech clause, Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 2, subd. (a). Thus, leafleting on the walkways and entrance had to be allowed. The ban on solicitation and the area restriction were not narrowly tailored and thus were likely to be found unconstitutional under the intermediate scrutiny standard applicable to time, place, and manner regulations of protected speech. Without an area restriction, the city could not show that permits were necessary. The trial court erred in failing to consider whether safety concerns justified the leafleting ban in the parking lot. Strict scrutiny applied to bans on offensive speech, which generally were unconstitutional. Standing was properly found under the relaxed standard applicable to free speech issues, even though no organization members had been prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's orders as modified to strike overbroad language from the preliminary injunctions and to strike a paragraph about leafleting in the parking lot.</SPAN></P>

The minor and his representatives appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor defined his best interests as remaining with his de facto family. The appellate court agreed. Application of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1901 et seq., to this minor constituted a violation of substantive due process lead to the conclusion that application of the ICWA to the minor constituted a violation of equal protection of the laws under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The record reflected that the minor had no association with the Tribe other than genetics. There was no Indian family here to preserve. The minor's sole connection with the Tribe was a one-quarter &quot;Minnesota Chippewa Tribe&quot; genetic contribution from an enrolled bloodline, and enrollment based on that genetic contribution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a group of landlords, sought a writ of mandate to prohibit enforcement of defendant city's Just Cause for Eviction ordinance, adopted as initiative Measure EE. The Superior Court Alameda County, California, permitted proponents to intervene, and, on cross-motions for summary judgment, determined that certain provisions were preempted by state law but severable and that other portions were not preempted. The landlords appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With regard to a provision that was not challenged by the landlords, the court held that Measure EE conflicted with Evid. Code, &sect; 500, by creating a presumption that the ordinance had been violated, for purposes of a tenant's action for damages, if a landlord recovered possession in order to move in and the landlord's continuous possession was less than 36 months. That provision impermissibly shifted a tenant's burden to show that the eviction was a pretext and that the landlord thus violated the ordinance. The court found no error in the trial court's findings that certain provisions were not preempted. The statutory burden of proof did not conflict with requirements that a landlord prove a specified ground for eviction or an enumerated exception. Those provisions placed the burden of proof on the landlord, just as &sect; 500 did, to show the existence or nonexistence of facts essential to a claim for relief that the landlord asserted in an action for unlawful detainer. The court also held that state statutes did not preempt good faith and proper motive requirements, attorney fee provisions, protections based on age, notice and cure provisions, or a damages remedy for tenants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's conclusion that certain provisions of the ordinance were valid and concluded that a portion of the ordinance that was not challenged in the trial court was also preempted. The remainder of the ordinance remained enforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco, California, denied appellant father reunification services pursuant to Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 361.5, subd. (b)(12), which allowed a court to bypass reunification services where a parent had committed a &quot;violent felony&quot; within the meaning of Pen. Code, &sect; 667.5, subd. (c). The father had been convicted twice of second-degree robbery. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the father did not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in being provided with reunification services. Any risk of an erroneous deprivation of the fundamental right to parent was mitigated by the father's right to counsel and the fact that his convictions were found beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that &sect; 361.5, subd. (b)(12), did not deprive a parent of due process and did not require a parent to relinquish parental rights. It represented a reasonable and rational means to advance a prime purpose of juvenile court law -- providing protection and stability to dependent children in a timely fashion -- by efficiently allocating scarce reunification services. Section 361.5, subd. (b)(12), satisfied the requirements of substantive due process when considered in connection with &sect; 361.5, subd. (c). The father's prior convictions and his history of domestic violence with his child's mother, coupled with his violation of a restraining order prohibiting him from contacting the mother and his refusal to accept responsibility for his actions, created a possibility of harm to the child that provided the basis for the denial of services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Environmentally sensitive butterfly habitat was present on the property for which the coastal development permit was granted. The commission concluded that the project would have a potentially negative impact on the habitat but that mitigation measures would reduce those impacts to a level of insignificance. The court held that the project did not comply with the resource-dependent use restriction in Pub. Resources Code, &sect; 30240, subd. (a), because construction of a home was not a resource-dependent use. In accordance with Evid. Code, &sect; 664, the court had to presume that the commission made a determination pursuant to Pub. Resources Code, &sect;&sect; 30512, 30512.2, 30513, that the local coastal program incorporated the restriction. The commission abused its discretion when, without making sufficient findings, it excused the failure to conform pursuant to Pub. Resources Code, &sect; 30010, to avoid an unconstitutional taking. The court provided guidance for the trial court on remand by stating that the commission did not err when it considered scenic and visual resources pursuant to Pub. Resources Code, &sect; 30251, because the commission properly interpreted provisions of the land use plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Alameda County, California, issued a preliminary injunction restraining defendants, the California Board of Education and associated officials, from denying diplomas to members of the 2006 graduating class at California public high schools who were otherwise eligible to graduate, but who had not passed both portions of the California high school exit exam (CAHSEE). Defendants sought a writ of mandate to vacate that order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff students claimed it was a violation of the state constitution's Equal Protection Clause to apply the CAHSEE diploma requirement, Ed. Code, &sect; 60851, subd. (a), to students who allegedly had passed all the course requirements for graduation, but who had not been provided with the educational resources necessary to enable them to pass the CAHSEE. The court held that the trial court erred in granting a statewide preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from enforcing the statute mandating the CAHSEE diploma requirement, because in so doing, the trial court gave undue weight to the students' claim of irreparable injury and insufficient weight to defendants' countervailing concerns, and because the relief was legally impermissible, misdirected in character, and overbroad in scope. The trial court did not give due consideration to the obligation to preserve the status quo or take into account the public interest in enforcing the CAHSEE diploma requirement as an integral part of the statutory scheme adopted by the legislature in an effort to raise academic standards in California public schools. The relief granted was not tailored to the fundamental right allegedly infringed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order, insofar as that order granted a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff union, representing the lawyers in the office of the Attorney General, brought mandamus proceedings against defendants, the Governor and the Department of Personnel Administration (DPA), seeking an order for the DPA to adopt a parity pay formula or, alternatively, to base compensation on a meaningful salary survey. The Superior Court of Sacramento County, California, denied the writ petition, and plaintiff sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union argued that lawyers in the Attorney General's office were under-compensated compared to those in other civil service job classifications. The reviewing court held that any pay disparity did not raise a conflict with the merit principle under Cal. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, subd. (b). The sole aim of the merit principle was to prohibit the spoils system of employment and promotion in state service and thereby to preserve a civil service system in California free from decision making on the basis of political patronage. The court rejected the union's argument that the merit principle included an inherent link between salaries and merit, finding no support for such an expansive interpretation in the text, the ballot argument, the historical context, or case law. The aim of the merit principle was not to equate merit with meritorious. The court declined to incorporate the statutory principle of like pay for like work into the merit principle. The court also rejected the argument that the pay scale made it impossible for the Attorney General to perform his constitutional mandate, noting a lack of evidence that the Attorney General had been unable to adequately enforce the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment denying the request for a peremptory writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a Japanese corporation and its subsidiaries, sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), to vacate its denial of motions for judgment on the pleadings in an action brought under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 354.6 by real party in interest, a former wartime prisoner who was a Korean national during World War Two, for compensation for his wartime unpaid labor and personal injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former prisoner alleged that he was forced to work without compensation at a slave labor camp in Korea operated by the corporation's predecessor in interest. The corporation unsuccessfully moved for judgment on the pleadings, contending that the former prisoner's claims were preempted by treaty. The court initially denied the corporation's petition for writ of mandate. The California Supreme Court granted review and directed the court to reconsider its decision in light of recent case law. The court observed that Treaty of Peace with Japan, Sept. 8, 1951, arts.  4(a), 26, 3 U.S.T. 3169, 3173, 3190 embodied the federal purpose and foreign policy that war claims by individuals of non-signatory nations, such as Korea, were to be resolved through diplomacy. Resolving claims of those injured by acts and omissions of enemy corporations in wartime was within the traditional subject matter of foreign policy in which national, not state, interests were overriding. Thus, the court held that the expression of foreign policy found in the treaty sufficiently conflicted with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 354.6 so as to preempt the statute under the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art.  VI, cl. 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition for writ of mandate.  The court ordered the trial court to vacate its order denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings and to enter a new order granting the motion and dismissing the action.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect; 12022.5, subd. (a), the cited factors were the opportunity to deliberate and consider the course of action, the close proximity of victims, and the inherent high risk to the victim. All of those factors required factual determinations beyond those necessarily encompassed by the jury verdict. With respect to resentencing on the enhancement, the court held that Pen. Code, &sect; 1170.1, subd. (d), suffered from the same constitutional infirmities that the U.S. Supreme Court found in Pen. Code, &sect; 1170. The court could not, however, extend to the enhancement sentence the California Supreme Court's limited judicial reformation of Pen. Code, &sect; 1170.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Yolo County (California), which terminated her parental rights to her daughter pursuant to Prob. Code, &sect; 1516.5, after the minor's paternal aunt and the aunt's husband had been the minor's guardians for almost four years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that &sect; 1516.5 was an unconstitutional infringement on her fundamental rights as a parent because it allowed termination of parental rights without a showing of current parental unfitness. The court held that although a parent had a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and companionship of her child, that interest was not without limits. Section 1516.5 reflected valid legislative determinations and was narrowly tailored to achieve the State's compelling interest in protecting the child. The statute did not impermissibly infringe upon a parent's liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of the child because the statutory scheme provided the parent with the requisite due process before parental rights could be terminated. Section 1516.5 was retroactive and applied after two years of the guardianship, regardless of whether any part of the two-year period occurred before the statute became law. The evidence supported the presumption that the mother was presently unfit to properly care for the minor and that it would have been detrimental to the minor not to terminate the mother's parental rights in order to permit the guardians to adopt her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents petitioned to terminate a minor's guardianship. The Butte County Superior Court, California, denied the parents' petition, finding that it would be detrimental to the minor to terminate the guardianship. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court concluded that the parents were not entitled to have the minor's guardianship terminated and the minor returned to their custody on the basis that they were fit parents because they could provide adequate food, clothing, and shelter for her. Under Prob. Code, &sect; 1601, the best interest of the minor was the sole criterion for termination of the guardianship. Substantial evidence supported the trial court's decision that to terminate the guardianship would have been detrimental to the minor. The mother still had a severe anger control problem, while the father still had a drinking problem. When the minor first went to live with the guardians, she was in rather poor physical, emotional, and educational condition. By the time of the hearing on whether to terminate the guardianship, the minor had lived with the guardians for nearly four years. During that time, she had thrived in all areas of her life. The minor, who was of the age and reasoning capacity to be entitled to have her views considered, adamantly opposed termination of the guardianship. The trial court did not err in concluding that it was in the minor's best interest not to terminate the guardianship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which, in an action brought by respondent landlords' association, issued a peremptory writ of mandate enjoining the city from enforcing a mandatory inspection program for rental housing units as set forth in Hayward Mun. Code, &sect; 9-5.401 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As originally written, the ordinance forced landlords to grant city inspectors access to occupied units without tenant consent. After the trial court found the ordinance invalid, the city amended the ordinance to provide that landlords were responsible for making a good faith attempt to obtain consent and that a city inspection required a warrant absent the tenant's consent. The court held that the amended ordinance did not create an agency relationship under Civ. Code, &sect; 2295, between the city and a landlord because the good faith requirement was not a bilateral agency agreement; thus, the ordinance was not inconsistent with the general law of agency and was not preempted under Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 7. The association lacked standing to assert a Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const., 4th Amend., claim on behalf of tenants because it had no privacy interest in units occupied by tenants. Civ. Code, &sect; 1954, subd. (a), did not preempt the ordinance because entry by city inspectors did not conflict with the statutory restrictions on entry by landlords. There was no substantive due process violation because the amended ordinance did not penalize an owner for a tenant's lack of cooperation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order and remanded with directions to the trial court to enter a new and different order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employer appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which found that the employer violated the Hayward Living Wage Ordinance (LWO) (Hayward Mun. Code, art. 14, &sect; 2-14.010 et seq.), breached its city contracts, and committed labor law violations. The trial court awarded back wages and unpaid benefits, imposed statutory penalties, and awarded attorney fees and costs to plaintiff employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer did not pay the wages required by the LWO to employees whose work on city contracts was performed outside the city. The court held that the extraterritorial effects of the LWO did not violate Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 7. The LWO was not unconstitutionally vague because it sufficiently indicated that it was applicable to all employees who worked on or under a service contract with the city. The LWO applied to those employees even when they performed other tasks. The trial court properly shifted the burden of proof to the employer because it was best able to determine which employees were covered. The contracts were sufficiently definite, and the employees were intended third party beneficiaries under Civ. Code, &sect; 1559. The employees could recover penalties under Lab. Code, &sect; 2699, subd. (g), because their amendment of their complaint to allege such claims after the statute granted them standing was not a retroactive application of the statute and related back to their original complaint. The violations were not willful under Lab. Code, &sect; 203, because the employer had good faith arguments. Penalties were properly calculated under Lab. Code, &sect;&sect; 223, 227.3, 210, 225.5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed both the judgment and the postjudgment orders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco, California, granted respondent nurse's petition for a writ of administrative mandate and reversed a disciplinary action taken by appellant Board of Registered Nursing against the nurse. The Board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nurse was convicted of a misdemeanor after he caused a single-car accident while driving with a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit. The court concluded that the discipline imposed by the Board was authorized. The nurse was found to have committed unprofessional conduct under Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, &sect; 2762, subd. (b), based on his use of alcohol in a manner dangerous to himself or others. The nurse's conduct bore a sufficient nexus to the qualifications of a nurse to withstand constitutional scrutiny. The legislature did not violate the Constitution by granting the Board the power to assert jurisdiction over one of its licensees based on an alcohol-related conviction or the use of alcohol in a dangerous manner. Subjecting the nurse to discipline for a single alcohol-related misdemeanor conviction under &sect; 2762, subd. (c), did not violate the nurse's right to equal protection. The nurse did not demonstrate that he had been treated more harshly than a physician would have been under similar circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California) sustaining defendant's demurrer to a misdemeanor complaint that charged him with violating Irvine Mun. Code, &sect; 4-14-803, which prohibited registered sex offenders from entering city parks and recreational facilities without written permission from the city's police chief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the state statutory scheme imposing restrictions on a sex offender's daily life fully occupied the field and therefore, pursuant to Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 7, preempted the city's efforts to restrict sex offenders from visiting city parks and recreational facilities. Moreover, state law preempted the ordinance's requirement that sex offenders obtain written permission from the city's police chief before entering a city park and recreational facility because that regulation was a de facto registration requirement. State law had long occupied the area of sex offender registration to the exclusion of local regulation, and the city ordinance's written permission requirement amounted to an additional registration requirement imposed on sex offenders who wished to enter city parks. The court declined to sever the written permission requirement from the city ordinance because to do so would result in an outright ban on sex offenders entering city parks and recreational facilities and would substantially alter the meaning of the city ordinance as originally enacted.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was properly charged with the unlawful penetration with a foreign object special circumstance added to Pen. Code, &sect; 190.2, subd. (a)(17), by Proposition 115.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The criminal court found defendant guilty of infractions of the San Bernardino, California, County Code. It also entered orders for him to bring the property into compliance, pursuant to San Bernardino, Cal., County Code &sect; 33.0112, and ordered him to repay the costs of investigating, analyzing, and prosecuting the criminal action, in the amount of $ 1,014. The Appellate Division panel concluded that, because there was no authorizing legislation permitting the County to recover the costs of criminal law enforcement in this instance, that portion of the sentence requiring defendant to pay the costs of the investigation and prosecution was unlawful. Upon transferring the case, the Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion as the Appellate Division. That structure of the legislative scheme did not authorize adding the costs of enforcement as a penalty in criminal prosecution of code infractions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a nuisance action, the Los Angeles County Superior Court, California, granted plaintiff county's motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting defendants from dispensing marijuana anywhere in the unincorporated area of the county without first obtaining the necessary licenses and permits required by county ordinances. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that under Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11362.768, the county was authorized to regulate medical marijuana dispensaries (MMD's). The county's constitutional authority to regulate the particular manner and location in which a business may operate was unaffected by Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11362.775. The limited statutory immunity from prosecution under the &quot;drug den&quot; abatement law provided by &sect; 11362.775 did not prevent the county from applying its nuisance laws to MMD's that did not comply with its valid ordinances. The evidence refuted defendants' claim that MMD's were zoned so as to relegate them to remote and commercially infeasible locations. The court found unpersuasive defendants' argument that the county ordinances violated the equal protection clause of Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 7, by not allowing MMD's to operate in the same zones as pharmacies. The county's concern with dispensaries attracting an illegal resale market for marijuana was justified in light of the use of marijuana for nonmedical purposes. Because similar risks were not associated with the location of pharmacies, the county had a rational basis for zoning MMD's differently than pharmacies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, convicted child molesters, filed a petition for an order prohibiting defendant California Department of Justice from posting their names, pictures, and other identifying information on the Department's Megan's Law Web site pursuant to Pen. Code, &sect; 290.46. The San Diego County Superior Court, California, denied plaintiffs' petition. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued the Department was equitably estopped from rescinding their exclusions from disclosure on its Megan's Law Web site because they detrimentally relied on exclusions they received in 2005 before the law was retroactively changed in 2006. The court found plaintiffs' equitable estoppel argument to be meritless. Plaintiffs adduced no evidence the Department ever assured them their exclusions were ironclad and the disclosure requirements were never subject to amendment. Further, they adduced no evidence of detrimental reliance. The retroactivity provision did not constitute an ex post facto law. The state's determination to legislate with respect to convicted sex offenders as a class, rather than require individual determination of dangerousness, did not make the statute a punishment under the ex post facto clause. One of the plaintiffs was ineligible for the exclusion because he was the victim's uncle rather than a parent, stepparent, sibling, or grandparent. There was no equal protection violation in limiting the exclusion to parents, stepparents, siblings and grandparents, as there was a rational basis for differentiating between them and more distant family members.</SPAN></P>

The court issued an alternative writ of mandate and stayed all proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original and non-original purchasers sought damages for alleged defects in their homes. The housing corporation sought to have the matter heard by a referee, as the purchase agreements between the housing corporation and the original purchasers required all disputes to be determined by judicial reference. The superior court denied the motion to compel, and the housing corporation sought a writ of mandate. The court refused to issue a writ with regard to the non-original purchasers because they never consented to judicial reference. The court did issue a writ with regard to the original purchasers. The court found that the reference provision in the agreements was not unconscionable under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1670.5. The reference provision was clear and conspicuously placed in the agreements, and the provision was not one-sided or oppressive. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 645.1(a) required that a referee's fees be paid as agreed by the parties, and the court found no harshness in the parties' agreement to share referee fees equally. Under Cal. Code Civ.

Sess.) increased the value of defendants' credits to be applied towards their fines from a minimum of $30 a day to a minimum of $125 per day, but the bill did not change the requirement in Pen. Code, &sect;&sect; 1205, subd. (a), and 2900.5, subd. (a), that credits be applied to all fines, including penalty assessments, as provided by People v. McGarry; [2]-Although the trial courts complied with the relevant statutes as amended by Assem. Bill No. 1375 at the time of sentencing, reversal was nonetheless warranted due to Assem. Bill No. 2839 (2015-2016 Reg. Sess.), which provides that courts must use the base fine in applying defendants' custody credits, not the total fine including penalty assessments; [3]-Because the new law lessened defendants' punishment, the rule of In re Estrada required that the law be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city enacted an inclusionary zoning ordinance, requiring that 10 percent of all newly constructed units must be affordable as that term was defined. Plaintiffs, a non-profit corporation and an association of professionals involved in residential construction, sought to have the inclusionary zoning ordinance declared facially invalid. Defendant demurred. The trial court sustained the demurrer and entered judgment in defendant's favor. The court of appeal affirmed, holding that because defendant had the ability to waive the requirements imposed by the ordinance, the ordinance did not, on its face, result in a taking. The application of a general zoning law to particular property effected a taking if the ordinance did not substantially advance legitimate state interests or deny an owner economically viable use of his land. Creating affordable housing for low and moderate income families was a legitimate state interest and the inclusionary zoning ordinance substantially advanced the important governmental interest of providing affordable housing for low and moderate income families.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit brought by plaintiff water rights holders, the trial court ruled that the collection of certain fees pursuant to Wat. Code, &sect; 1525, constituted valid regulatory fees rather than taxes. The California Court of Appeal, Third Appellate District, reversed in part, holding that &sect; 1525 was constitutional on its face, but that the fee statutes and their implementing regulations were unconstitutional as applied. Review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2003, the legislature passed amendments to the Water Code. Section 1525 was enacted as part of these amendments. The defendant in this case was the State Water Resources Control Board. The court held that the amendments, including &sect; 1525, did not explicitly impose a tax and were not facially unconstitutional. Reference to the statutory language revealed a specific intention to avoid imposition of a tax. By its terms, &sect; 1525 permitted the imposition of fees only for the costs of the functions or activities described, and not for general revenue purposes. Section 1525, subd. (c), stated that the fees imposed had to relate to costs linked to issuing, monitoring, enforcing and administering licenses and permits. The trial court was directed to make findings regarding whether the associated costs of the regulatory activity were reasonably related to the fees assessed on the payors. Whether the implementing regulations violated the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution by over-assessing the beneficial interests of certain federal contractors would depend on whether the regulations fairly assessed and apportioned the federal contractors' beneficial interests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's judgment holding that the fee statutes at issue were facially constitutional was affirmed. However, the appellate court's judgment was reversed as to its determination that the statutes and their implementing regulations were unconstitutional as applied. The case was remanded for the appellate court to remand to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractors challenged defendant city's law requiring preferential treatment to women and minorities in the awarding of city contracts. The trial court held that the ordinance violated Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 31. The California Court of Appeal, First District, Division Four, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the matter to determine whether the federal equal protection clause required the ordinance. Review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 31, which forbid a public entity awarding public contracts to discriminate or grant preferential treatment based on race or gender, did not violate the political structure doctrine. The doctrine did not invalidate state laws that broadly forbid preferences and discrimination based on race, gender and other similar classifications. Section 31 prohibited race- and gender-conscious programs the federal equal protection clause permitted but did not require. Instead of burdening the right to equal treatment, &sect; 31 directly served the principle that all governmental use of race had to have a logical end point. A core purpose of the equal protection clause was to do away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race, ultimately creating a political system in which race no longer mattered. The federal funding exception in &sect; 31, subd. (e), did not exempt the ordinance from &sect; 31's general prohibition of racial preferences. The court agreed with the appellate court that remand was necessary for the limited purpose of adjudicating whether the equal protection clause required the ordinance as a remedy for the city's own discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In six cases that were consolidated on appeal, appellants, the State of California and two private organizations, appealed judgments of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco, California, which concluded that California Family Code statutes defining civil marriage as the union between a man and a woman, specifically Fam. Code, &sect;&sect; 300 &amp; 308.5, were unconstitutional under the California Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The constitutionality of the State's marriage statutes was reviewed under the rational basis test. In upholding their constitutionality, the court concluded that the State's historical definition of marriage did not deprive individuals of a vested fundamental right or discriminate against a suspect class. The opposite-sex requirement was rationally related to the State's interest in preserving the institution of marriage in its historical opposite-sex form, while also providing comparable rights to same-sex couples through domestic partnership laws. The trial court's decision, although purporting to apply rational basis review, essentially redefined marriage to encompass unions that had never before been considered as such in the state. It was beyond the judiciary's realm of authority to redefine a statute or to confer a new right where none previously existed. The legislature's power to regulate marriage was exclusive and subject only to constitutional restrictions. If marriage were to be extended to same-sex couples, such a change would have to come from the people - either directly, through a voter initiative, or through their elected representatives in the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner school district sought review of a decision by the California Workers' Compensation Appeals Board, which found that respondent teacher had sustained a work-related injury, the injury caused permanent partial disability after adjustment for age and occupation of 34 percent, and the teacher needed further medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether new laws enacted by S.B. 899, 2003-2004 Reg. Sess. (Cal. 2004), specifically Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 4663, 4664, requiring apportionment based on causation, applied retroactively in this case, which was submitted to a workers' compensation judge for decision prior to the effective date of the legislation, but on which an award and findings were not issued until four days after the effective date of the legislation. The court held the repeal of former Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4663 was effective immediately on enactment of S.B. 899 and that Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 4663, 4664, were applicable to any case still pending, except those cases that were finally concluded subject only to the WCAB's continuing jurisdiction under Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 5803, 5804. The use of the language &quot;regardless of the date of injury&quot; in S.B. 899 clearly reflected the understanding and intent of the legislature that S.B. 899 would be applicable to pending workers' compensation cases and not just to new compensable injuries occurring after its effective date. The WCAB was incorrect in holding the apportionment provisions of S.B. 899 did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the WCAB was annulled, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dependency case, an attorney on behalf of petitioners, two children who were being home schooled, filed a petition for a writ of mandate. Counsel sought an order directing respondent, the Los Angeles County Superior Court, California, to order that the children be enrolled in a public or private school for their safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an opinion on rehearing, the court concluded that California statutes permit home schooling. Although the legislature had not amended the statutory scheme so as to expressly permit home schooling, the legislature had apparently accepted the proposition that home schools were permissible in California when conducted as private schools. Several statutory enactments indicated a legislative approval of home schooling, by exempting home schools from requirements otherwise applicable to private schools. However, the court also concluded that parents did not possess an absolute right to home school their children. Although parents possessed a constitutional liberty interest in directing the education of their children, that right had to yield to state interests in certain circumstances. The statutory permission to home school could constitutionally be overridden in order to protect the safety of a child who had been declared dependent. An order that would require the children to attend school for their safety would not be an unconstitutional violation of their parents' right to direct the children's education because the parents had already been judicially determined not to be fit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for writ of mandate was granted, and the matter was remanded to the trial court with directions to vacate its order denying the motion to require the children to attend public or traditional private school, and to reconsider the motion. The trial court was directed to consider whether the children's safety necessitated removing them from home schooling.</SPAN></P>

The charges concerned four separate victims. Defendant claimed the prosecution was barred by applicable statutes of limitations. He argued the limitations periods could not be extended by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 803(g), because pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 805.5, the tolling provision did not apply to any offense for which the statute of limitations expired before January 1, 1985. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 803(g) and renewed his statutory construction argument that &sect; 805.5 superceded &sect; 803(g). He also complained the trial court did not sentence him in accordance with his plea agreement. None of these arguments had merit. Section 805.5 did not bar prosecution of early offenses. Section 803(g) was not an ex post facto law. There was no agreement at the time of plea as to what the sentence would be.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, city residents and taxpayers, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which sustained without leave to amend the general demurrer filed by defendant, the state superintendent of public instruction. The trial court rejected plaintiffs' contention that Sen. Bill. No. 39 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) violated the &quot;home rule&quot; provisions of the California Constitution and the city charter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill provided emergency funding to the city's schools and provided that control of the schools would temporarily be assumed by the state. The superintendent was directed to appoint a state administrator to run the city's school system for at least two fiscal years or until the projected completion of a specified improvement plan to resolve the fiscal crisis and return the district to solvency. The court found no genuine conflict between the bill and the text of the city charter regarding city elections. The school board continued to be elected as it always was before the emergency legislation, and the hiatus in the exercise of its ultimate responsibility was only temporary, during which period the board continued to serve an advisory role. The court added that education was a matter of statewide concern, as was the need to rescue school districts from insolvency in order to continue the education of students. The temporary administration did not appear overbroad and seemed narrowly tailored to the fiscal emergency faced by the school district and the need to insure that the additional state funds being provided were not wasted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dependency case, the attorney for two of the three minor children in the case petitioned for extraordinary writ relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the parents did not have a constitutional right to home school their children. The parents argued that when the mother instructed the children at home, they were acting within the law because the mother operated through a Christian school where the children were &quot;enrolled.&quot; However, the parents did not demonstrate that the mother had a teaching credential such that the children could be said to be receiving an education from a credentialed tutor. The education of the children at their home, whatever the quality of that education, did not qualify for the private full-time day school or credentialed tutor exemptions from compulsory education in a public full-time day school set forth in Ed. Code, &sect;&sect; 48222 &amp; 48224. The Christian school administrator's occasional observance of the mother's instruction of the children and their occasional taking of tests at the private school was without legal significance. Although the parents asserted that it was because of their religious beliefs that they home schooled their children and that those beliefs were based on Biblical teachings and principles, their statements were conclusional, not factually specific.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contract provided for the American manufacturers to build a plant in Iran for assembling the Chinese manufacturers' computer products to be sold in Iran and elsewhere. According to the complaint, the Chinese manufacturers decided not to proceed with the transaction. The trial court granted summary judgment to the Chinese manufacturers on the ground that the transaction was illegal. The court affirmed, observing that unlicensed transactions involving Iran violated Exec.

By entering into the contract, the American manufacturers approved and facilitated a prohibited transaction, acts barred by 31 C.F.R. &sect; 560.206. Their activities, done in furtherance of the agreement to supply goods, technology, and services to Iran, were all prohibited, absent a specific license under 31 C.F.R. &sect; 501.801(b). Hence, the contract was unenforceable under Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 1550(3), 1596, 1598, 1667, 1668.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB), challenged a judgment from the Court of Appeal, Second District, Division Two (California), which reversed the trial court and ruled that, because the four-year period of Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 19057, for notice of a deficiency assessment had expired before additional federal tax was assessed, plaintiff taxpayers were not required to report the federal changes or pay additional state taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The IRS audited the federal income tax return of the taxpayers and eventually determined, more than four years after the date on which the taxpayers filed their federal and state income tax returns for that tax year, that the taxpayers received greater taxable income than they reported and that they owed additional federal income taxes. Although a change in federal taxable income had the effect of increasing the taxpayers' state taxable income and income tax for the same period, the taxpayers did not report the federal adjustments to the FTB pursuant to Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 18622. The court held that because the taxpayers failed entirely to report a final federal determination that increased their federal tax liability and consequently increased their state taxes payable, Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 19060, subd. (a), was the applicable limitations period, permitting the FTB at any time to mail the taxpayers notice of the proposed deficiency assessment based upon the additional state taxes payable for the disputed tax year. The general limitations period provided in Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 19057, did not apply under those circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, two recipients and one applicant of an aid program, challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that entered judgment in favor of defendants, a county and others, in plaintiffs' action that challenged the validity of a home visit pilot program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' first contention was that the home visit program was preempted by state statute and regulations that set eligibility standards for CalWORKS. They also argued the program conflicted with two specific regulations adopted by the Department of Social Services (DSS) relating to home visits. The court noted that its first step was to determine whether the local program contradicted the statute and regulations. It held that it did not. The court held that it would rely on the DSS's interpretation of its own regulations - that the home visit pilot project was a method of ensuring eligibility that did not conflict with statute or regulation. Plaintiffs next characterized the home call visitation pilot program as an early fraud prevention and detection program. The court did not agree. Plaintiffs also argued that the program violated their state and federal constitutional rights. The court examined whether the home visit constituted a search within the meaning of U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court held that if it did, it was justified under the &quot;special needs&quot; rationale. The program rules did not present a facial violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant sought review of a decision of respondent, the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (California), which awarded penalties pursuant to Lab.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant contended that the workers' compensation judge (WCJ) should have calculated penalties against her employer and its insurer under a former version of &sect; 5814, even though the WCJ issued his findings after June 1, 2004, which was the operative date of the amended statute. The court rejected the claimant's argument, concluding that the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board did not err in following its own precedent to rule that the amended version of &sect; 5814 controlled the calculation of penalties against the employer and its insurer. Pursuant to &sect; 5814, subds. (h), (i), the amended statute applied to all injuries regardless of the date of the injury. The statutory repeal rule, which provided that the repeal of a cause of action based on a statutory right applied to all pending cases, was applicable because the legislature had repealed the purely statutory right to the use of the previous formula for calculating penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendant, the California National Guard, alleging violations of equal protection, freedom of speech, and other rights under the California Constitution and state law. The San Francisco County (California) Superior Court granted plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication, finding that the guard's application of the policy regarding discharge of homosexuals under 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 654(b) was unconstitutional. The guard appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial and on appeal, the guard contended that the term &quot;federal active duty&quot; was limited by federal statute to full-time duty in the active military service of the United States, and did not include full-time state National Guard duty, i.e., the kind of active duty service performed by plaintiff. The court of appeal rejected that argument, as there was nothing in the record suggesting the cited federal statutes narrowed the definition of state active duty. Assuming that the cited federal statutes controlled, plaintiff's service in the guard qualified as state &quot;active duty&quot; funded by the federal government but authorized, organized, implemented, and administered by the state. The withdrawal of plaintiff's federal recognition and subsequent release from his National Guard position based on the policy on homosexuals constituted a release from active duty for cause. However, the court also explicitly limited the scope of the trial court's ruling to providing and securing equal access, without regard to sexual orientation, to employment and service in state active duty positions not requiring federal recognition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded to the trial court with orders to modify its declaratory judgment so as to clearly limit the scope of its coverage to individuals seeking state active duty employment in positions not requiring federal recognition. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court issued an order to show cause and requested briefing on whether Cal.  Code Civ. Proc.  &sect; 1008 was unconstitutional to the extent that it purported to deprive trial courts of their inherent power to reconsider interim rulings. The instant court concluded that trial courts retained their inherent power notwithstanding the language of &sect; 1008. However, the instant court also concluded that it did not need to reach the constitutional issue in this case, as the facts supported the trial court's finding that new circumstances arose to support reconsideration of the trial court's denial of the real party in interest's Cal.  Code Civ. Proc.  &sect; 473 motion to set aside the dismissal. The instant court noted that petitioner did not contend that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the real part in interest's &sect; 473 motion, but did contend that the instant court should grant the petition, because petitioner realized while preparing it that the signature on the real party in interest's attorney's declarations did not appear to be the same as that on the complaint and the dismissal with prejudice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant marijuana growers appealed a summary judgment from the Superior Court of Tulare County (California), which granted plaintiff county's request for an injunction prohibiting the growers from operating a medical marijuana collective or cooperative (MMC) in an agricultural zone in violation of Tulare County Ordinance No. 352, &sect; 15.3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning ordinance restricted MMCs to commercial and manufacturing zones. The court held that the zoning ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the county's power to enact local legislation under Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 7. The ordinance's definition of an MMC did not conflict with Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11362.775. The ordinance also did not conflict with Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11362.5. Pursuant to Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 11362.768, subds. (f), (g), 11362.83, subd. (a), local governments were not prohibited from adopting ordinances to regulate MMCs and could apply zoning ordinances to MMCs that did not have storefronts or retail outlets. An equal protection challenge under Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 7, failed because MMCs and individual growers were not similarly situated and because the different treatment of MMCs was rationally related to preventing potential difficulties with such operations. Because marijuana was a controlled substance under Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 11054, subd. (d)(13), 11358, and not merely a crop or horticultural product, the county did not have to define growing marijuana as an acceptable agricultural use of land for purposes of its zoning laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit brought by plaintiff apartment association and rental housing owners alleging that defendant city's fire sprinkler ordinances requiring automatic fire sprinklers in certain apartment buildings, which were adopted outside the 180-day period set out in Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 17958, were not timely adopted and were void, the Alameda County Superior Court, California, sustained the city's demurrer. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted two ordinances which required that apartment buildings of a certain size, having interior corridors particularly susceptible to rapidly spreading fire, be retrofitted with automatic fire sprinkler systems. The trial court concluded that &sect; 17958 did not preclude cities from making amendments, additions, or deletions to the California's Building Standards Code (State Code) more than 180 days after the publication of the new State Code. The association, which contended that the trial court's interpretation of &sect; 17958 was incorrect, argued that the ordinances were not adopted within the 180-day time frame prescribed &sect; 17958 and were null and void. The instant court agreed with the trial court. The instant court believed the legislature added the 180-day timeframe to &sect; 17958 so there would be a date certain when all cities would be covered by new versions of the State Code. The statute simply said that if a city did not make changes to the State Code within 180 days, the provisions of the State Code became &quot;effective&quot; by default. The instant court followed the plain language of &sect; 17958, while still promoting the legislative intent underlying the statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals from the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), the issues were: (1) whether plaintiff, the California State Personnel Board (SPB), had standing to challenge a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that restricted its review of disciplinary actions; and (2) whether the disciplinary provisions and the legislation that sanctioned the MOUs violated the constitutional mandate that the SPB review disciplinary actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State civil service employees assigned to state bargaining units 8, 11, 12, and 13 represented by their unions, negotiated labor contracts with defendant, the California Department of Personnel Administration, the governor's representative in labor contract negotiations. The labor contract of each of the bargaining units, the MOUs, provided an alternative dispute resolution mechanism for litigating a disciplinary action in a forum other than the SPB. Plaintiffs, the SPB and an association of state attorneys and administrative law judges, filed actions to prohibit implementation of the disciplinary provisions of the MOUs. On appeal from the three consolidated cases, the appellate court concluded that the SPB had standing to challenge an MOU that precluded it from carrying out its constitutionally mandated duty to review disciplinary actions. Additionally, the MOUs violated Cal. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3(a), as they restricted the SPB's adjudicatory authority to review disciplinary actions taken against state civil service employees. Lastly, the implementing legislation violated Cal. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3(a), to the extent it sanctioned the offending provisions of the MOUs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court deleted the condition to the trial court's judgment and affirmed the judgment relating to the unit 8 MOU. The appellate court also affirmed the judgment relating to the MOUs of units 11, 12, and 13. The appellate court dismissed, as moot, the appeal from a case that sought a writ of mandate challenging the provisions of the unit 8 MOU.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employees sued real party in interest employer for failing to compensate them as required under the Los Angeles Living Wage Ordinance (LWO) (L.A. Admin. Code, &sect; 10.37 et seq.). Respondent, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, concluded that a regulation limiting eligibility to employees who worked more than 20 hours a month on city contracts was a valid clarification. The employees petitioned for writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held that the regulation at issue directly conflicted with the LWO's articulated remedial purpose by limiting eligibility to those who worked 20 hours a month or more on city contracts and by limiting the amount of LWO wages to the hours actually spent on a city contract. By its terms the LWO required employers who were recipients of a service contract with the city to pay covered employees LWO wages. An &quot;employee&quot; was defined in part as any person who expended &quot;any of his or her time&quot; on such a service contract. Thus, any employee of a city service contractor who spent &quot;any time&quot; at all working on a city service contract subject to the LWO was eligible for LWO wages. To find otherwise would have resulted in a restriction not contemplated by the plain language of the ordinance. Further, the language of the LWO imposed a minimum hourly wage for the hours worked by the employee, not one for each hour worked by the employee on the city contract. Thus, the regulation could not limit LWO wages to the hours an employee of a private contractor actually worked on city contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the employees' petition for writ of mandate and directed the superior court to vacate its order upholding the regulation and to enter a new and different order invalidating the regulation.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 466.5(d)(1). In most cases, therefore, the requisite proof that the key was a master key would include proof that the defendant knew that the key would operate more than one car door. The court of appeals stated that possession of a master key was not a crime. It became a crime only when the master key was used as a burglary tool under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 466, or when the master key was used to open a car door lock with the intent to use it in the commission of an unlawful act. The court concluded that knowledge that a key used in a crime was a master key was not an element of the offense described in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 466.5(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee union sued appellants, alleging unfair business practice and violations of Cal. Lab. Code &sect;1155.4(c), which provided that agricultural employers or associations of employers could not have provided any thing of value to an employee, group, or committee of employees for purposes of influencing other employees in the exercise of the right to organize and bargain collectively. Appellee alleged appellants provided funds and other materials in opposition of appellee's attempt to unionize strawberry pickers. The court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, and declared that appellants violated the statute. Appellants challenged the ruling. The court held that the legislative history of the statute supported the application to actions such as those taken by appellee, including giving small contributions to an employees' organization and providing portable toilets for meetings. The court found the statute should have been construed liberally, and exempting appellants' conduct would have created a loophole in the law. The court found 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 186, the basis of Cal. Lab. Code &sect;1155.4(c), was interpreted in same fashion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, because the statute in question applied to the circumstances, as the statutory history of the statute supported application to actions such as appellants' actions, similar federal law provided the same result, and the statute did not unconstitutionally infringe on appellants' rights to free speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged regulation limited contributions to ballot measure committees controlled by candidates. The court concluded that the regulation conflicted with multiple provisions of the Political Reform Act of 1974, Gov. Code, &sect; 81000 et seq., and thereby exceeded the agency's authority under Gov. Code, &sect; 83112, to promulgate regulations consistent with the statute as provided in Gov. Code, &sect;&sect; 11342.1, 11342.2. As stated in Gov. Code, &sect; 85303, subd. (c), the contribution limits imposed by Gov. Code, &sect;&sect; 85301, 85302, did not apply to contributions to any committees, which would include ballot measure committees, as long as the money was used for purposes other than making contributions to candidates for elective state office. Moreover, the regulation purported to decrease contribution limits below the amount permitted by Gov. Code, &sect;&sect; 85303, subd. (b), 85310. Treating contributions to a candidate-controlled ballot measure committee as contributions to a candidate for elective office conflicted with the one bank account rule set forth in Gov. Code, &sect; 85201, which required all contributions to a candidate to be deposited in the candidate's campaign account.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant father appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which denied his special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuits against public participation) statute,&nbsp;Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 425.16. Plaintiff, the mother's boyfriend, had filed suit against the father, alleging defamation, emotional distress, malicious prosecution, and statutory violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father accused the boyfriend of abusing the father's sons. He reported the alleged abuse to school officials and police, but the resulting investigations did not reveal any abuse. The court held that the unsuccessful filing of a petition for an injunction under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 527.6 could not form the basis for a malicious prosecution action. Cal. Penal Code &sect; 11172(a), which imposed liability for knowingly filing false reports of child abuse, was not an unconstitutional content-based regulation of speech, and it overrode the litigation privilege of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 47. Cal. Penal Code &sect; 11172(a) applied to the father's reports. The imposition of liability was not limited to voluntary reports made to the listed agencies but included reports made to persons who were legally required to transmit such reports to the listed agencies. The boyfriend demonstrated a probability of prevailing on his claims for defamation, emotional distress, violation of &sect; 11172, and abuse of process. He presented evidence that he never abused the children. The mother provided support for the element of malice and outrageous conduct in her description of the father's threats and abusive behavior.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order denying the father's special motion to strike and directed the trial court to enter a new order striking the cause of action for malicious prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sacramento County Superior Court, California, granted plaintiffs' request for injunctive and declaratory relief and issued a writ of mandate. The trial court ordered defendant Commission on State Mandates to set aside its decisions that relied on Gov. Code, &sect; 17556, subd. (f), as amended, in finding that costs imposed on local governments by ballot measure mandates were not reimbursable. The Commission appealed. Plaintiffs cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1988 and 2001, the Commission decided the Open Meetings Act and Brown Act Reform test claims. In each decision, the Commission found that the state had to reimburse costs to local governments for costs mandated by the legislation. In 2005, the legislature enacted Assembly Bill No. 138, which amended Gov. Code, &sect; 17556, subd. (f), to provide that the state did not need to reimburse a local government if a statute imposed duties that were necessary to implement, reasonably within the scope of, or expressly included, in a ballot measure approved by the voters in a statewide or local election. The court concluded that, to the extent &sect; 17556, subd. (f), as amended, provided that the state need not reimburse local governments for imposing duties that were expressly included in or necessary to implement a ballot measure, the amended statute was consistent with Cal. Const., art. XIII B, &sect; 6. However, the court found the &quot;reasonably within the scope of&quot; language contained in the amended statute to be invalid. The language was so broad that it could not be used as a standard for determining whether the state had to reimburse a local government for having imposed a duty resulting in costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed in part and affirmed in part. The trial court was directed to modify the judgment and to modify its writ of mandate to direct the Commission to set aside the decisions challenged in this action with respect to the Open Meetings Act and Brown Act Reform test claims, as well as two other test claims, and to reinstate the Commission's prior decisions.</SPAN></P>

A five year zoning freeze in the agreement was not a surrender of governmental function as the agreement required development in accordance with the county's general plan and county approval of detailed building plans.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Denial was affirmed. State law permitting development agreement did not require any particular stage of project approval as a prerequisite. The agreement required development in accord with the county's general plan and made building plans subject to county approval, so it was not a surrender of county regulatory power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found the state legislature had not specifically authorized the bringing of private actions under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), Pub.

The appellate court held such suits could be brought in state court as long as the state legislature had not prohibited them, which it had not. The TCPA did not violate freedom of speech as it was not a total ban on fax advertising, and the government's substantial interest in regulating unsolicited fax advertisements, which shifted advertising costs to nonconsenting consumers, was advanced by the TCPA, which was narrowly tailored to achieve those interests. The overbreadth doctrine did not apply, as the TCPA did not punish protected speech. The senders did not show the TCPA's meaning was uncertain under all circumstances, so it was not void for vagueness. The TCPA's allowance of actual damages or $ 500, whichever was greater, and treble damages for willful violations, was not excessive. The TCPA did not foreclose the use of a class action to enforce it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Contra Costa County, California, which convicted him, following a jury trial, of six counts of robbery under Pen. Code, &sect;&sect; 211-212.5.  The jury also found that he suffered prior strike convictions under Pen. Code, &sect; 1170.12, subds. (b), (c), two prior serious felony convictions under Pen. Code, &sect; 667, subd. (a), and served two prior state prison terms under Pen. Code, &sect; 667.5, subd. (b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced under the &quot;Three Strikes&quot; law to an aggregate state prison term of 210 years to life. The court held that the robbery statute,&nbsp;&sect; 211, was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant was not charged in the information with robbery of banks, but rather with robbery of persons who happened to be bank employees. The statute's language was sufficiently clear and settled to provide notice of the proscribed conduct and enable those charged with its violation to properly prepare a defense. No prejudicial errors were committed in the resolution of defendant's motions related to his right to counsel. Although the trial court erred by failing to inform defendant of his right to appointed counsel and to expressly obtain a waiver of that right when he was arraigned on the felony information, as Pen. Code, &sect; 987, required, any error was harmless, and his waiver of the right to counsel was both knowing and voluntary. No instructional error occurred. Despite a victim's failure to positively identify defendant at trial or in a pretrial photo lineup, the robbery convictions were all supported by the evidence. Finally, the sentence did not violate any constitutional principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Stanislaus County Superior Court, California, modified a dispositional order and directed that defendant minor, a sex offender, be housed at the Division of Juvenile Facilities (DJF) pursuant to Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 1752.16. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the juvenile court had the authority to direct that the probation officer seek placement of defendant in the DJF sex offender program. The sex offender program offered by DJF pursuant to &sect; 1752.16 was merely another treatment alternative available to counties, and an order that a ward receive treatment through such a program was fully authorized by Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect;&sect; 202, 727, &amp; 731. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 1752.16 violated the equal protection clauses of the U.S. and California Constitutions because similarly situated wards could be treated differently based simply on their county of commitment, i.e., as to whether or not the county had entered into a contract with DJF. The legislature's decision to provide an additional rehabilitation alternative to those counties in need of such a program did not violate the equal protection rights of persons in such counties that accepted such an offer. Because it did not authorize punishment of a type or duration greater than permitted before its enactment, &sect; 1752.16 was not a prohibited ex post facto law. Defendant did not demonstrate that the juvenile court abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which, in respondent trade association's action for declaratory and injunctive relief, found invalid the city's inclusionary housing ordinance, San Jose Ordinance No. 28689.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance required developers to construct affordable housing at specified percentages or to pay an in-lieu fee. The superior court applied a standard set forth in the case law for a takings claim under Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 19, based on housing exactions, under which the amount of the fee had to bear a reasonable relationship to the deleterious public impact of the development. The court held that the standard applied by the superior court was inapposite and that the ordinance instead had to be reviewed as an exercise of the city's police power under Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 7. The ordinance did not prescribe a dedication, and it was not enacted for the purpose of mitigating housing loss or other deleterious impacts caused by new residential development. Rather, its purpose was to enhance the public welfare by alleviating the demand for affordable housing. As such, the proper inquiry for the superior court was whether the association had rebutted the presumption that the inclusionary housing conditions were reasonably related to the city's legitimate public purpose of ensuring an adequate supply of affordable housing in the community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded with directions to the superior court to reconsider the validity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted defendant under Pen. Code, &sect; 12370, of possession of body armor by a person previously convicted of a violent felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on parole for voluntary manslaughter, defendant was found wearing a protective vest with a label indicating that it was body armor for ground troops. The State presented expert testimony that defendant's vest could stop small arms fire. The court observed that &sect; 12370 incorporated the definition of body armor in Cal. Code Regs., tit. 11, &sect; 942, subd. (e), as providing ballistic resistance to test ammunition for certification purposes. This required proof that defendant's vest was equivalent to, or better than, body armor that was certified for sale to law enforcement; however, certification was not an element of a &sect; 12370 violation. The court concluded that &sect; 12370 was void for vagueness because it failed to provide fair notice to defendant that his vest was illegal. Section 12370 had to be construed to contain a knowledge element, in accordance with Pen. Code, &sect; 20. The definition of body armor entailed a rigorous testing regimen to establish that a vest would protect against specified test ammunition. Even if defendant had read &sect; 12370 and the regulations, he could not have reasonably ascertained that his vest possessed the characteristics making it illegal under &sect; 12370.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue on appeal was whether the plaintiffs' claims for injuries and wrongful death allegedly caused by smoking, which accrued in 1999, were barred by Cal. Civil Code &sect; 1714.45 in light of the 1997 amendment to that section eliminating the statutory immunity from products liability actions previously accorded tobacco manufacturers. The tobacco companies argued that the application of amended &sect; 1714.45 to permit the plaintiff to proceed would constitute a retroactive application of the 1997 amendment because the conduct on which their claims were based all took place prior to January 1, 1998. Upon review, the court of appeals found that both the text of amended &sect; 1714.45 and its legislative history clearly indicated the Legislature's intent that the 1997 amendment applied to causes of action that accrued after the amendment's effective date. Further, the appellate court concluded that application of amended &sect; 1714.45 to causes of action that accrued on or after January 1, 1998 served a sufficiently important state interest to constitute a reasonable exercise of the Legislature's power to protect the health and welfare of the people of California.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court's judgment of dismissal was reversed with directions where retroactive application of an amendment to the California Civil code eliminating defendant tobacco companies' statutory immunity for products liability actions was necessary to subserve the sufficiently important state interest of protecting the health and welfare of the people of California.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property was a large parcel of undeveloped land that abutted rural county land on two sides, while the other two sides bordered on developed city land. The challenged density restriction applied only to the owner's property and to no other property within the city's urban service area. The court held that the restriction was valid because it bore a substantial and reasonable relationship to the public welfare goals of limiting the burden on city services and resources, discouraging noncontiguous development and urban sprawl, and maintaining the city's unique rural character. Accordingly, it was a proper exercise of the city's police power and did not violate the owner's right to equal protection of the law under U.S. Const., 14th Amend., and Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 7, subd. (a). The trial court correctly considered the nature of all the land surrounding the property, including the rural county land, in concluding that there was no spot zoning. Although the city had allowed development of other parcels, the city was entitled to regulate development in this way, and the density restriction reasonably reflected the city's concern with sprawl and with maintaining its rural ambiance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Proposition 71 provided state funding for stem cell research. The court held that the initiative's provisions, which dealt with such matters as medical and ethical standards, conflict of interest standards, and bond financing did not violate the single-subject rule of Cal. Const., art. II, &sect; 8, subd. (d), because all of these matters were directly germane to the single goal of conducting the research. The impartial analysis of the measure that was provided under Elec. Code, &sect; 9087, was sufficiently accurate and informative to survive a due process challenge. The California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act, Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 125290.10 et seq., did not violate the prohibition in Cal. Const., art. XVI, &sect; 3, against the appropriation of funds for the benefit of private entities because significant public and financial accountability standards were present. The conflict of interest standards in Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 125290.30, 125290.50, were not inconsistent with other provisions of California law or with public policy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed from a decision of the Court of Appeal (California), affirming the trial court's judgment which held that plaintiffs' action to establish the invalidity of a utility tax defendant city imposed without voter approval was filed more than three years after the ordinance establishing the tax was enacted, and, therefore, untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city adopted La Habra, Cal., Ordinance 1445, establishing a utility users tax to raise revenue for general governmental purposes. Defendant did not submit the ordinance to voters for approval as required by Proposition 62. More than three years after the ordinance was adopted, plaintiffs sought a declaration that the tax was invalid under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 53723 and a refund of past taxes collected in violation of law. Defendant demurred, arguing that plaintiffs' action was untimely. The trial court, sustaining defendant's demurrer, dismissed, and the court of appeal affirmed. The state supreme court rejected plaintiffs' claim of delayed accrual, observing that a change in the law did not revive stale claims. However, the intent of Proposition 62 was not merely to preclude enactment of a tax ordinance without voter approval, but to preclude continued imposition or collection of such a tax as well. Thus, defendant's continued imposition and collection of the tax was an ongoing violation, upon which the limitations period began anew with each collection. Therefore, plaintiffs' action for declaratory judgment and writ of mandate was timely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced after the passage but prior to the effective date of Cal. Proposition 36 (approved 2000), which required that an eligible defendant convicted of a nonviolent drug possession offense was to be granted probation. The judgment of conviction did not become final until after the act's effective date. Defendant contended that he was entitled to receive probation under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1210.1(a) of the act. The court concluded, however, that a saving clause in &sect; 8 of the act precluded retrospective application. The rule of lenity did not apply because the act was not ambiguous. Moreover, legislative refusal to apply a statute retroactively did not violate the equal protection provisions of the state or federal constitutions. The court noted that the legislature, in choosing to specify that a penal statute was prospective only, ensured that penal laws would maintain their desired deterrent effect by carrying out the original prescribed punishment as written.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate judgment that upheld defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect; 11377, subd. (a), and was granted deferred entry of judgment (diversion) under Pen. Code, &sect; 1000 et seq. After finding defendant had an inability to pay, the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) terminated her from diversion, reinstated criminal proceedings, and placed her on formal probation for three years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a criminal defendant granted deferred entry of judgment under Pen. Code, &sect; 1000 et seq., could not be terminated from such diversion based solely on her inability to pay the fees of the program to which she had been referred. Such a termination violated the deferred entry of judgment statutory scheme. The plain language of Pen. Code, &sect; 1000.3, provided for termination of diversion only when the defendant (1) was performing unsatisfactorily in the assigned program, (2) was not benefiting from education, treatment, or rehabilitation, (3) had been convicted of a misdemeanor that reflected the defendant's propensity for violence or a felony, or (4) had engaged in criminal conduct rendering him or her unsuitable for deferred entry of judgment. Defendant was never able to get into her assigned program and had no chance to perform satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily. Defendant had no chance to benefit from education, treatment, or rehabilitation. There was nothing in the record suggesting she was convicted of any crime or engaged in any further criminal conduct. Thus, there was no statutory basis for terminating defendant's diversion.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect; 289, subd. (d). The trial court placed defendant on probation and denied his motion to bar the mandatory lifetime sex offender registration requirement imposed by Pen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer responding to a report of a possible sexual assault found the victim partially undressed. She was extremely intoxicated and did not know what had happened. Hospital staff found that she had injuries consistent with having been sexually assaulted. The victim and defendant were strangers. The court held that the sex offender registration requirement did not violate defendant's rights under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const., 14th Amend., and Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 7, subd. (a), considered under the rational basis standard. Although there were other sex offenses for which registration was not mandatory, the court determined that there was a rational basis for distinguishing between defendant's offense and other offenses involving voluntary participants or spouses. The evidence did not support defendant's claim that the victim's participation was voluntary, and the purpose of sex offender registration was to warn strangers and acquaintances. A substantive due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment also lacked merit because persons convicted of crimes had greatly attenuated privacy rights, especially regarding their identities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner lodging operators sought extraordinary relief after respondent Superior Court of Sonoma County, California, ordered them to comply with legislative subpoenas issued by real party in interest city for the production of business records necessary for auditing their compliance with the city's transient occupancy tax (TOT) on rooms occupied in hotels, inns, motels, and other lodgings for a period of less than 30 consecutive calendar days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City of Cloverdale Ordinance No. 257 required operators to collect the tax and provide returns to the city's tax administrator showing total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. The operators challenged the validity of the TOT. The court held that the definitions in the ordinance were not vague in violation of the Due Process Clause. The ordinance did not attempt to impose the TOT on the basis of either the type or location of the property. Rather, the ordinance imposed the tax on persons defined as &quot;transient,&quot; and clearly identified such persons as anyone occupying a &quot;hotel&quot; for a period of less than 30 consecutive calendar days. The TOT did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The tax applied equally to all &quot;transients,&quot; i.e., those occupying a room in any &quot;hotel&quot; for a period of less than 30 calendar days. The city's classification provided a rational distinction between transient and non-transient residents. The court concluded that the ordinance was not preempted by state law, specifically Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 7280, subd. (a), because it did not duplicate, contradict, or enter an area fully occupied by state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition for extraordinary relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensed an amateur radio operator to use certain frequencies for commercial purposes. The City of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, where the operator resided and the city-approved radio antennae were located, required a radio operator to obtain a city permit for such usage. The city denied the permit. Upon application by the city, the trial court issued a permanent injunction, prohibiting the radio operator from using any frequencies commercially. The operator contended that federal communications law preempted the injunction. The appellate court agreed. Congress preserved some local zoning authority over the placement of commercial mobile radio service transmitters. The FCC exclusively regulated the allocation of frequencies. Here, the city denied a permit for commercial use without a legitimate reason, treading upon an area preempted by federal communications law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff electrical subcontractor sued defendant general contractor for breach of contract, seeking contract damages as well as statutory charges for the general contractor's failure to make prompt payment of retention proceeds that were paid to the general contractor following a school project's completion. Following a jury trial, the Superior Court of Alameda County, California, entered judgment for the subcontractor. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court properly calculated the statutory prompt payment charges imposed under Pub. Contract Code, &sect; 7107. Section 7107, subd. (f)'s requirement of a two percent per month charge on unpaid retention proceeds was not compounded on a monthly basis. The statute scrupulously maintained a distinction between the withheld amount and the charge, and contained no expression of an intent to compound or to increase the &quot;improperly withheld amount&quot; by the amount of the charge on a monthly basis. Compounding the charges in the case at bar would have produced an additional sum that was close to half of the total amount improperly withheld. Because the language of &sect; 7107, subd. (f), was hardly so clear as to admit of no doubt that the legislature intended such harsh results, the court would not read the statute to permit compounding of the two percent prompt payment charge. The court concluded that because the two percent per month charge under &sect; 7107, subd. (f), ceased to accrue upon entry of judgment, the subcontractor was entitled to receive interest on the amount of its judgment, but not at a rate exceeding 10 percent simple interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of possession of hydriodic acid with intent to manufacture methamphetamine in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11383(c)(2). The Court of Appeal of California, Third Appellate District, reversed. The State petitioned for review, alleging that the intermediate appellate court incorrectly characterized Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11383(f) as creating an evidentiary presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for possession of hydriodic acid with intent to manufacture methamphetamine was based on her possession of sufficient amounts of red phosphorus and iodine to manufacture hydriodic acid. The intermediate appellate court held that language in Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11383(f), through which the conviction was obtained, created an improper mandatory presumption because it relieved the prosecution of the burden of proving the ultimate fact of possession of hydriodic acid. The court disagreed. The court held that the language of &sect; 11383(f), which deemed possession of iodine and phosphorus to be possessed of hydriodic acid, did not create a mandatory rebuttable presumption under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 600 but, rather, created a substantive rule of law. Therefore, the prosecution had not been relieved of its burden of proving the ultimate fact of possession of hydriodic acid. Rather, the legislature had expanded the conduct that constituted such possession by enacting Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11383(f). Hence, defendant was not impermissibly convicted of such possession even though no hydriodic acid was ever found.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court insofar as it reversed the conviction on the count alleging possession of hydriodic acid with intent to manufacture methamphetamine. The court further remanded the cause for the intermediate appellate court to resolve any outstanding issues regarding that count. In all other respects, the court affirmed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect; 66020, protest exception to waiver did not apply, and no new conditions had been imposed on a later phase of a project already underway; [3]-Alternatively, the conditions, which limited the duration of the permit and precluded rebuilding part of the stairway, were validly imposed under Pub.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action relating to precondemnation activities for a tunnel to transport water, the Superior Court of San Joaquin County, California, granted real party in interest, the State, a one-year temporary easement to conduct environmental surveys, finding those activities did not work a taking, but denied its petition to conduct geological activities. The State and petitioner landowners sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that both the geological activities and the environmental activities as authorized would work takings. The geological activities, which included removing earth from private property and replacing it with a permanent, physical column of cement to depths of 205 feet, would intentionally result in a permanent physical occupation. The environmental activities, which were intended to occur for up to 66 days over a one year period by as many as eight people at a time per owner, would work a taking because they intentionally acquired a temporary property interest of sufficient character and duration to require being compensated. The statutory precondemnation procedure under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1245.010 et seq., could not be used to accomplish those takings. If an entity intentionally seeks to take property or perform activities that will result in a taking, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, subd. (a), requires that entity to directly condemn the affected property interest in an authorized condemnation suit, in which a landowner receives all of his or her constitutional protections against eminent domain. The statutory precondemnation procedure does not provide such a suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order denying entry to conduct the geological activities, reversed the order granting entry to conduct the environmental activities, and remanded the matter to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's ruling, which allowed her to go forward with her action and required petitioner to file an answer, was based on the legislature's enactment of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 340.9. This statute revived insurance claims arising out of the Northridge earthquake of 1994 that previously had been barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Petitioner sought a writ of mandate directing the Los Angeles County Superior Court (California) to vacate and set aside an order granting real party in interest's motion to reconsider an earlier order sustaining a demurrer to petitioner's complaint without leave to amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">California Fair Employment and Housing Commission (Commission) appealed judgment from Superior Court of Los Angeles County, granting plaintiff landlord's writ of mandamus, commanding Commission to vacate damages award to victim of plaintiff's housing discrimination based on race under California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Cal. Gov't Code, &sect; 12900 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate in superior court contending that the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission's (Commission) factual determination that plaintiff had discriminated against victim because of her race was incorrect. Commission ordered plaintiff to cease and desist from such conduct and to pay to victim a civil penalty of $ 10,000 as actual damages for victim's emotional distress. The court held the Commission was constitutionally prohibited from making its award for emotional distress and lost housing opportunity. A claim for nonquantifiable general compensatory damages for emotional distress or other intangible injury was neither necessary to the purpose of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tow truck association filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging defendant city's tow truck regulatory scheme. The association alleged the permit system was preempted by federal and state law, and that all or part of the system was unconstitutional. The Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco, California, entered judgment in favor of the city. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that under Veh. Code, &sect; 21100, subd. (g)(1), the ability of local authorities to regulate a towing company is restricted to the jurisdiction in which the company maintains its principal place of business. The city's attempt to regulate towing services and drivers whose principal place of business or employment was located in another jurisdiction was preempted by state law. Nothing in &sect; 21100, subd. (g)(1), suggests the legislature intended that tow truck firms or drivers would have to obtain a permit in each and every (separate) jurisdiction in which they do business. The legislature could rationally decide that towing companies doing business in multiple cities should not have to comply with a &quot;patchwork&quot; of regulatory schemes, nor bear the financial cost of obtaining permits in numerous jurisdictions. The court further held that the city could collect a fee or fees to cover the cost of regulating towing companies. In enacting Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 7233, the legislature did not forbid local authorities from collecting fees to cover the cost of regulating towing businesses, notwithstanding any other fees the state might collect from those businesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, retired law enforcement and military personnel, law enforcement associations, and firearms rights groups, challenged a voter-enacted local gun control ordinance of defendant charter city. The Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco, California, found that the ordinance was preempted and that the city's home rule power under Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 5, subd. (a), did not override the state preemption. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance prohibited most city residents from possessing handguns and all city residents from selling, distributing, transferring, and manufacturing firearms and ammunition. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, holding that the ordinance was preempted in its entirety under Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 7. The section banning possession on private property was impliedly preempted by Pen. Code, &sect; 12026, which precluded local public entities from adopting impediments to possession of firearms by legally qualified citizens. The ban on possession also obstructed the objectives of the Penal Code scheme regulating handgun possession in California. The section banning sale, manufacture, transfer, or distribution of firearms was also preempted by state law. It contravened Gov. Code, &sect; 53071, which expressly preempted any local enactments relating to the licensing or registration of commercially manufactured firearms, and conflicted with the Unsafe Handgun Act (UHA), Pen. Code, &sect;&sect; 12125-12233. The ordinance could not escape challenge under the home rule provision of Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 5, subd. (a), because it did not address only a municipal affair.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant, who was 17 years old at the time of his crime, of first degree murder, in violation of Pen. Code, &sect; 187, and other crimes, and found true the special circumstance under Pen. Code, &sect; 190.2, that he murdered the victim to further the activities of his gang, and found that he used a firearm. The Superior Court of Orange County, California, imposed a sentence of 50 years to life in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held that defendant's sentence of 50 years to life was a de facto life sentence in violation of U.S. Const., 8th Amend. The potential for defendant to be released in his late sixties after a half century of incarceration was not sufficient to escape the rationale of Eighth Amendment case law. However, Pen. Code, &sect; 3051, gave defendant what the Constitution compels, a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate maturity, rehabilitation and fitness to reenter society at some point in the future. Because the trial judge determined that defendant was reformable, and because &sect; 3051 affords a defendant the opportunity for a parole hearing 25 years into his prison term, the court modified the sentence to include a minimum parole eligibility date of 25 years. Although &sect; 3051 is designed to apply to a sentence by operation of law, the modification ensured that defendant would receive the benefit of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a substitute teacher, agreed not to return to a school after an incident with a student. He later began picketing on public sidewalk in front of the school, targeting plaintiff, the assistant principal who investigated the incident, leafleting for months and accusing the principal of racism. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, issued an injunction under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 527.6. The teacher appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injunction prohibited harassment, required the teacher to stay 100 yards away from the principal and his residence and place of work, and required the removal of the principal's name from written material. The court found that an injunction was proper to prevent harassment. The denial of an injunction to the school district did not bar issuance of an injunction to the principal under res judicata or collateral estoppel. The actions of the teacher were not a &quot;labor dispute&quot; and therefore were not protected by Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 527.3. Finally, there was substantial evidence that the teacher's conduct was harassment under Code Civ. Proc. 527.6. On free speech arguments, the court found that the conduct was not protected because it was harassment and was conducted in the immediate vicinity of a school, producing special harms distinct from communicative impact. Thus, an injunction could be proper, even if a prior restraint on speech. The injunction at bar was overbroad, however, because it precluded the use of the principal's name no matter how it was used. The distance restriction on activity near the school was not supported by evidence that the conduct disrupted classwork.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for the trial court to determine what injunctions should issue and to issue an injunction to prevent harassment of the principal, so long as the injunction did not contain a blanket prohibition on the use of the principal's name and provided for a distance restriction that caused no more burden on speech than was necessary to prevent the harassment.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court rejected his contentions and held: (1) &sect; 707(d) satisfied minimum constitutional requirements; (2) &sect; 707(d) was not unconstitutional under the separation of powers doctrine, and (3) Cal. Proposition 21 did not violate the single-subject rule, set forth in Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 8(d), applicable to initiative measures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city amended its waste disposal ordinance to state that waste disposal companies that received a termination notice were limited to servicing their then-existing accounts. Plaintiff waste disposal company filed a mandate petition, alleging that the state had preempted any local waste disposal ordinances, making the amendment unconstitutional. The Los Angeles County Superior Court (California) denied the petition. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 40000 et seq., required local agencies to divert from landfills half of the trash they produced. The Act gave local agencies discretion to grant exclusive waste disposal franchises. In order to meet its obligations under the Act, the city decided to grant an exclusive franchise. The city notified the company that it was planning to award an exclusive waste disposal franchise and that it could continue to operate under Cal Pub. Res. Code &sect; 49520 for up to another five years, but only as to its then-current accounts. The city subsequently amended its city ordinance to prevent waste disposal companies that had received the five-year termination notice from soliciting new business during that five-year period. The trial court found that the city's amended ordinance was not preempted by, and did not conflict with, state law. The court affirmed, holding that the city ordinance restricting waste disposal companies with nonexclusive franchises to their existing accounts during the &sect; 49520 phase-out period was not inimical to the Act. It did not prohibit what the statute commanded or command what it prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
