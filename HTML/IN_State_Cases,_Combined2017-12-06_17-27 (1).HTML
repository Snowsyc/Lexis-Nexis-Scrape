<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent Indiana Department of State Revenue investigated petitioner taxpayers' business activities to determine if they were not remitting the sales and income tax due. The Department generated jeopardy tax assessments. The taxpayers filed a verified petition for judicial review of a final determination by the Department and a petition to enjoin the collection of tax pending the original tax appeal. The Department filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the taxpayers' petition. The court noted that while Ind. Code &sect; 6-8.1-5-3, on its face, provided no opportunity to contest jeopardy tax assessments, taxpayers could challenge jeopardy tax assessments pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 6-8.1-5-1. The court next rejected the Department's claim that the taxpayers' failure to file a claim for refund with the Department precluded their challenge with the court. The taxpayers' challenge both arose under the tax laws of Indiana and was an initial appeal of a final tax determination made by the Department. It did not matter that the taxpayers had not filed a claim for refund because Ind. Code &sect; 6-8.1-5-3 was silent as to the manner by which a taxpayer could challenge the validity of a jeopardy assessment. Also, the claim for refund statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 6-8.1-9-1 (2007), made no mention of jeopardy tax assessments. In addition, 45 Ind. Admin. Code &sect; 15-5-8(c) (2007), the Department's own regulation, provided that taxpayers could protest a jeopardy assessment within 20 days after the assessment was made. Thus, the taxpayers' action was an original tax appeal.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners conceded that their lawsuit did not implicate a final determination from either the Indiana Department of State Revenue (DOR) or the Indiana Board of Tax Review (IBTR). Nonetheless, petitioners claimed they were entitled to judicial review without satisfying the &quot;final determination&quot; requirement. The tax court disagreed, first finding that petitioners could not be excused from the &quot;final determination&quot; requirement because the DOR and IBTR could not decide constitutional issues. The tax court could not confer subject matter jurisdiction upon itself because the issues raised were, according to petitioners, of &quot;unparalleled public interest.&quot; Finally, the tax court held that petitioners' contention that the tax court had jurisdiction over their case pursuant to Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county board argued that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-10-16(c)(3) (2004) was unconstitutional unless a use (for an exempt purpose) requirement was read into the statute upon application. The county board had not argued why the preservation of land or water did not qualify as an exempt purpose. Rather, the county board argued that neither the parcel owner nor the Indiana Board explained how or why property used to retain and preserve the natural characteristics of land or water did qualify as a municipal, educational, literary scientific, religious, or charitable purpose. The county board misunderstood its burden; it was required to demonstrate why the statute, or the application thereof, was unconstitutional. Its failure to do so was, alone, enough to resolve the case in favor of the parcel owner. Moreover, it was reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended subsection (c)(3)'s requirements to mirror similar requirements for undeveloped land. Finally, when interpreting or applying subsection (c)(3), logic dictated that if a taxpayer used the property in a manner inconsistent with its stated purpose for existence (such as making a profit), the exemption did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayer, a riverboat casino, brought an action against respondent Indiana Department of State Revenue in which it challenged the Department's calculation of its riverboat wagering tax (RWT) liability for July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2003, under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 4-33-13-1.5 (2003). The taxpayer filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 2002, the legislature legalized &quot;flexible scheduling&quot; for riverboat gambling. Casinos that implemented flexible scheduling were subject to a graduated tax rate on their adjusted gross receipts under &sect; 4-33-13-1.5, which was retroactively amended in 2003. The Department recalculated the taxpayer's RWT based on the amendment. The taxpayer argued that in the amendment, the legislature intended to change the law from a double RWT rate structure to a single RWT rate structure. The court rejected this argument. In the amendment, the legislature clarified a previous ambiguity by stating that when flexible scheduling was implemented, the graduated rates were to be imposed on adjusted gross receipts received while the riverboat implemented flexible scheduling, but the rate was computed as if the riverboat had engaged in flexible scheduling during the entire period beginning July 1 of each year and ending June 30 of the following year. 2003 Ind. Acts 224, &sect; 48, a non-code provision, further clarified the legislature's intent by rejecting an interpretation that receipts received before the implementation of flexible scheduling were not included in the determination of which rate applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent, the Indiana Board of Tax Review (BTA), determined that petitioner taxpayer was not entitled to the property tax deduction for equipment that was certified as a resource recovery system (RRS) under Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-12-35 for its 1994-1997 tax years. The taxpayer appealed. The BTA moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that the taxpayer failed to file a timely Form 133.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court had subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal under Ind. Code &sect; 33-26-3-1 since the appeal arose under Indiana's tax laws and was an appeal of a BTA decision. The court did not need to address the specifics of the BTA's motion to dismiss for the taxpayer's failure to file Form 133 because it dismissed the case for other reasons. After the trial, the Supreme Court of Indiana reversed the court's Inland Container Corp. decision. In Inland Container Corp., the Supreme Court of Indiana held that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-12-28.5, as amended by 1995 Ind. Acts 25, &sect;&sect; 15,&nbsp;99(a), effective as of May 1, 1995, was not unconstitutional as applied to taxpayers whose RRS was first certified after 1993. The taxpayer's RRS was first certified in 1994. Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-12-28.5, as amended, eliminated the RRS except that it allowed the RRS on a phased out basis only if the RRS was certified before 1994. Therefore, the taxpayer was not entitled to the RRS property tax deduction for 1994 and succeeding years.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed. The publication met the three examples provided by the department under Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-26(g), to be commonly considered a newspaper. The publication carried less than a preponderance of advertising, it was authorized by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to run legal notices, and it had a masthead setting forth the publisher, editor, circulation, and place of publication. Moreover, the publication was available by subscription to anyone in the public who wanted it and it was widely distributed. Finally, it was published on a monthly basis since 1951.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent Indiana Department of State Revenue assessing petitioner out-of-state taxpayer with use tax for the 1998, 1999, and 2000 tax years. The taxpayer requested review. The taxpayer claimed that its free-of-charge apartment guides that were distributed in Indiana for members of the general public were &quot;free distribution newspapers&quot; (FDN) such that the guide's production costs were exempt from the use tax under Ind. Code &sect; 6-2.5-5-31.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Indiana use taxes were assessed on the cost of printing, labor, equipment and materials used in the production of the guides. Ind. Code &sect; 6-2.5-5-31(c)-(d) exempted FDNs, as defined in Ind. Code. &sect; 6-2.5-5-31(a), those taxes. The taxpayer carried its burden to prove that the guides qualified as a FDN. A FDN was not only a &quot;newspaper&quot; as the term newspaper was commonly understood because FDN was especially defined by &sect; 6-2.5-5-31(a). A FDN also did not have to be a legal publication under Ind. Code &sect; 5-3-1-0.7 since &sect; 5-3-1-0.7 did not have to be read in para materia with Ind. Code &sect; 6-2.5-5-31. An FDN could not be a &quot;book&quot; under Ind. Code &sect; 6-2.5-5-31(a)(4). The guides were not books because individual or successive issues were not &quot;complete in themselves.&quot; The guides continually had new information. The guides were more like periodicals in that they were produced at intervals and contained little or material other than advertising. Also, compliant with Ind. Code&nbsp;&sect; 6-2.5-5-31(a)(5)-(6), the guide's advertisers were not all related to each other by common ownership and the guides did contain community notices, which did not have to be legal notices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the Department's determination.

Therefore, the taxpayer met its burden of proving that the Apartment Guides were free distribution newspapers which qualified for exemption from the use tax as provided by Indiana Code &sect; 6-2.5-5-31.</SPAN></P>

After appeals from the assessor were unsuccessful, the taxpayer sought review. On appeal, the court determined that riverboat casinos were taxed as real property under Ind.

Const. art. 10, &sect; 1. The Indiana Legislature legalized riverboat gambling in an effort to revitalize the economy; by requiring the taxpayer to pay property taxes, revenue was then pumped back into the local economy. As such, there was no artificial distinction between certain members of the class. However, the Board erred by allowing a withdrawal of admissions under Ind. R. Trial P. 36. The Board should not have allowed a withdrawal because Rule 36 was expansive enough to allow requests on matters concerning opinions, contentions, or legal conclusions. Moreover, the assessor never filed a formal motion to withdraw. The court found that the taxpayer was entitled to a higher percentage of physical depreciation and obsolescence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayer appealed from a decision by respondent Indiana Department of Revenue that required it to pay use tax on certain leased aircraft pursuant to Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 6-2.5-3-2 (1993). It argued on motion for summary judgment that a private ruling exempted it, that a withdrawal of that ruling was impermissibly retroactive, and that imposition of the tax on it violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer, an aviation company, leased aircraft out-of-state but eventually hangared them in Indiana. It obtained a private ruling from the Department to the effect that since the aircraft were used in interstate commerce, they would not be subject to the Indiana use tax. When new developments in case law suggested that the aircraft might permissibly be subject to use tax because they did not qualify for a public transportation exemption, the Department repeatedly warned the taxpayer that if it renegotiated the leases or renewed them, it could face use tax liability, but the taxpayer nonetheless renegotiated them. The court held, first, that once the circumstances changed, a private ruling did not protect the taxpayer. Moreover, since it had been warned, abrogation of the private ruling was not an improperly retroactive administrative action. The taxpayer was entitled to a refund of at least part of the use tax paid, however, up to the amount of sales tax paid in another state, because &sect; 6-2.5-3-2 impermissibly discriminated against out-of-state providers of aircraft, since credits or setoffs against out-of-state sales tax were not allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the administrative decision, remanded the matter to the Department, and ordered it to refund an appropriate amount of tax to the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayers appealed from the final determinations of respondent Indiana Department of State Revenue denying claims for state income tax refunds. On cross-motions for partial summary judgment, the taxpayers argued the appeal could be maintained as a class action lawsuit even though members of the class had not exhausted the administrative remedies of Ind. Code &sect; 6-8.1-9-7, and that &sect; 6-8.1-9-7 violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 12, 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under Ind. Code &sect; 6-8.1-9-7, while the members of a prospective class were not required to have received final determinations from the Department before pursuing class certification, they were required to have at least timely filed claims for a refund. Taxpayers were not barred from filing class actions under Ind. R. Trial P. 23. As to Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, the putative class members were not completely denied access to the court; they were merely required to present their claims first to the Department. Thus, the presumptive constitutionality of Ind. Code &sect; 6-8.1-9-7 had not been overcome. The underlying policy of &sect; 6-8.1-9-7 justified a difference in treatment between taxpayers seeking a refund on a class-wide basis and other litigants seeking class-wide relief. The exhaustion of the claim for refund process was the only way by which taxpayers could bring a refund case to the Tax Court, and for the court to have jurisdiction to hear such appeals. The classifications between taxpayers seeking a refund on a class-wide basis and other litigants seeking class-wide relief were not arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable. Section 6-8.1-9-7 did not violate Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers' motion for partial summary judgment was denied. The Department's motion for partial summary judgment was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Indiana Supreme Court remanded the case, in which petitioner taxpayer argued that the hospital care for the indigent tax was unconstitutional, for determination on whether the tax violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Due Process Clause. The taxpayer filed a motion for partial summary judgment, and respondent Indiana Department of Local Government Finance filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before the enactment of the Indiana Hospital Care for the Indigent (HCI) Tax, Ind. Code &sect; 12-16-2-1 et seq., each of Indiana's counties bore all responsibility for indigent health care. The HCI program was then transferred to the state, and the HCI tax was imposed to finance it. The amount of the HCI levy for each county was the previous year's levy increased by the percentage of growth in assessed value of all property in Indiana. The HCI tax rate varied from county to county because of the difference in the counties' historical expenditures on hospital services for the indigent. The tax was constitutional under Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23. The distinction between counties was rationally related to the legislative goal of matching burden with benefit. The HCI tax was uniformly applicable to all similarly situated persons, because all residents in the same county were taxed at the same rate. The HCI tax did not violate the Equal Protection Clause in U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The separate classification of counties for purposes of the HCI tax was rationally related to the legitimate policy that each county was to pay the HCI tax in proportion to its expenses for indigent medical care.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Board had properly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the challenge. Challenges to late fees were not among the enumerated areas of authority listed at Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.5-4-1(a) (2001). Since the Board was entirely a creature of statute, and since the court's jurisdiction was limited to appeals from matters properly decided by the Board, it held that the instant appeal was not properly before it, and reminded the taxpayer that in such situations, relief, if any, would have to be sought in a court of general jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The tax court held that the property owners' argument was without merit because Garcia held that the Board's regulations with respect to grades above an A were not arbitrary and capricious. The property owners also argued that the Board's failure to instruct the hearing officer of his duties, in writing, constituted an error as a matter of law.

In determining that it lacked jurisdiction, the tax court held that the certification did not constituted a final determination. The tax court noted that the taxpayer could not confer subject matter jurisdiction upon the court by sending a letter to the DLFG and insisting that the latter changed the certification into an adjudicatory proceeding. In addition, Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-17-16(f) did not state, as alleged by the taxpayer, that the certification action was a final determination that was directly appealable to the tax court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner apartment association alleged that a &quot;shelter allowance&quot; provision in the Indiana State Board of Tax Commissioners' 2002 Real Property Assessment Manual was unconstitutional. Respondent Indiana Department of Local Government Finance moved to dismiss, claiming the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether the court had subject matter jurisdiction. First, the court found the state board issued the shelter allowance pursuant to its statutory mandate to regulate property assessment and taxation, pursuant to the Indiana tax laws providing for the assessment and taxation of real property, and therefore the association's claim that the shelter allowance violated Ind. Const. art. X, &sect; 1 was reasonably related to the Indiana tax statutes providing for real property assessment and arose under Indiana tax laws. The second question was whether the association's claim was an initial appeal of a final determination of the state board. The court determined the shelter allowance sufficiently affected the association's rights such that the court could reasonably treat it as a final determination. The final question was whether the association had to exhaust its administrative remedies. The court found that the association did not need to pursue further administrative remedies because the reasons for exhausting administrative remedies had been satisfied.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 6-6-2.5-28(a), -4.1-4(a), -4.1-4.5(a), for five quarters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company commenced a tax appeal and the department filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied.

Code &sect;&sect; 6-6-4.1-4(d), 6-6-4.1-5(d). The department contended the tax court incorrectly decided Jack Gray. Specifically, the department claimed the tax court could not, as a matter of law, simply declare a clause of the exemption void but could only declare the exemption void in its entirety. The tax court noted that nothing in its prior decisions rendered the exemption a nullity in its entirety. In addition, the tax court found the department's argument that it was administering the exemption in a nondiscriminatory matter was without merit. Accordingly, the tax court concluded the department acted contrary to law when it denied the company's claims for a refund of the MCFT for the five quarters at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner bought farm land, subdivided it and sold all but one lot. On that lot, the property owner built a shopping center. The state board changed the lot's classification from agricultural to commercial. The property owner argued that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-4-12 did not allow for the re-classification of a subdivided lot until title changed. The appellate court held that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-4-12 allowed an exception to re-classification designed to encourage developers to buy farmland, subdivide it, and resell the lots. This exception, however, applied when land was subdivided into lots only, not when a change of use occurred. Because the property owner converted the lot into an income-producing property, the exception was inapplicable, and the lot had been properly reclassified. The property owner also argued that the state board's assignment of value to the atrium of the shopping center was arbitrary. However, the property owner failed to submit any evidence as to the atrium's pricing, and presented only an alternate calculation, which did not constitute probative evidence. The property owner failed to meet its burden of proof on this issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Since 1979, Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-12-28.5 had provided taxpayers with a deduction for most of the value of tangible personal property used in resource recovery systems for solid wastes. The taxpayer obtained this deduction in 1994. In 1995 an amendment to the statute took effect, making the deduction altogether unavailable to those approved after 1993, and providing for a gradual phase-out as to other taxpayers. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the taxpayer, a non-uniformly applied tax violating Ind. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1, because there was no justification for treating the taxpayer differently from other taxpayers who met all the same requirements a year earlier. The taxpayer was entitled to the pre-deprivation remedy it sought when it withheld payment of its property tax, so the court remanded the proceeding to the state taxing agency for a redetermination of tax due under the phase-out.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no conflict between IFTA art. III(A) and Ind. Code &sect; 6-6-4.1-4. Thus, the agency properly concluded that the corporation could not reduce its total fuel consumed figures by the number of gallons used by its vehicles while they idled.

The corporation was not entitled to &quot;full credit&quot; under the IFTA for tax-paid fuel consumed in non-member jurisdictions. The application of Ind. Code &sect; 6-6-4.1-6(a)(3) did not violate the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art.

In granting petitioners summary judgment, the tax court held that the statutes were not unconstitutional on the whole and did not authorize department to deny the exemptions and refunds, and instructed department to grant the exemptions and issue refunds to petitioners. On petition for rehearing, petitioners asked for rehearing from the denial of class certification and department argued that it should have been given an opportunity to present material evidence as to the subject matter jurisdiction of all petitioners before petitioners were granted summary judgment. The tax court held that rehearing on the class certification issue was not needed because petitioners failed to present persuasive evidence of numerosity to justify class certification. Department, however, was entitled to a rehearing because the tax court's subject matter jurisdiction was not clear as it was not apparent that all petitioners were appealing final determinations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent Indiana Department of State Revenue issued a final determination not to apply Indiana's proportional use exemption to the motor fuel and surcharge taxes found at Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-6-4.1-4(d), 6-6-4.1-4.5(d) (West 2000) to which petitioner motor carriers were subject. Petitioners appealed the determination and sought class certification. Respondent moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1991 the Indiana Legislature amended Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-6-4.1-4(d), 6-6-4.1-4.5(d) to limit exemptions for taxes paid on fuel used for non-highway use to use &quot;in Indiana.&quot; This language was found to be unconstitutional in 1998 and again in 1999. The legislature then amended the statutes to remove the language. Petitioners sought an exemption for the taxes they owed pursuant to the unconstitutional provision for the period between when the court opinions were issued and the legislature amended the statutes. The court denied class certification because judicial economy was best served by joinder. Respondent argued that petitioners owed the tax because the unconstitutional language was not severable. Since no recognized exception existed to make the statutes non-severable, the 1998 and 1999 court decisions did not find the entire statutes to be unconstitutional but merely the &quot;in Indiana&quot; limitations present in both statutes to be so. The cases severed the infirm part of the statutes, while leaving the rest of the law intact. Thus, petitioners were entitled to the exemptions and refunds for the quarters at issue.</SPAN></P>

Motion converted to summary judgment, and summary judgment granted to petitioners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayer appealed a final determination of respondent Indiana State Board of Tax Commissioners, arguing that the administrative assessment of its property was invalid because tax regulations relating to grade, condition, and obsolescence were arbitrary and capricious and because their application to petitioner's property was not supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayer appealed respondent agency's property tax assessment, arguing that Indiana's regulations governing grade, condition, and functional and economic obsolescence of improvements to property were unconstitutionally arbitrary and capricious because they contained no ascertainable standards, and that the assessment in petitioner's specific case was not supported by substantial evidence. The court noted that it had already held the regulations unconstitutional, but that this did not invalidate existing assessments, so it then looked to the actual assessments in question. It found that respondent's hearing officer followed the directions in existing regulations as best he could, and set forth evidence supporting his determinations, on the issues of the grade of the improvement and economic obsolescence. However, the findings on the issues of condition and functional obsolescence were purely conclusory, and remand for further findings, with the burden on petitioner to establish prima facie cases for proposed values, was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the final determination as to the grade and economic obsolescence of petitioner's improvement, but reversed and remanded on the issues of condition and functional obsolescence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent Indiana Department of State Revenue found that petitioner owed controlled substance excise (CSE) taxes on 2000 pounds of marijuana which was discovered in a storage unit leased by petitioner. The taxes assessed totalled over $ 300,000. Respondent turned the marijuana over to police following an offer of immunity from prosecution. Appellant challenged the assessment of CSE taxes. The court held that for CSE taxes to be imposed, Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 6-7-3-5 required that the controlled substance must be possessed in Indiana in violation of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-48-4. The court held petitioner had the ability to maintain dominion and control over the marijuana, as petitioner had a possessory interest in the storage unit as lessee, and possessed a key to the unit. The court held petitioner had the intent to maintain dominion and control over the marijuana. Petitioner presented no evidence that anyone else had access to the storage unit. Because petitioner had exclusive possession, the court could infer that petitioner had knowledge of the marijuana. The court held an error in the date of assessment of the CSE taxes did not prejudice petitioner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the finding by respondent that petitioner owed controlled substance excise taxes on marijuana, because petitioner had constructive possession of the marijuana which was discovered in his storage unit, and an error regarding the assessment date did not prejudice petitioner.</SPAN></P>

They then sought review by respondent Indiana State Board of Tax Commissioners, which decreased their property's assessed value. They appealed respondent's decision. Petitioners failed to submit probative evidence that comparable properties were assessed differently from theirs. They also failed to establish that their property's proximity to power lines and/or a highway or the presence of easements on the property justified application of a negative influence factor in its valuation. While petitioners submitted probative evidence that a lower grade, for valuation purposes, was appropriate for their property, respondent rebutted their prima facie case with substantial evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent state revenue department argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the challenge by petitioner rural electric membership corporation of respondent's determination that future purchases and use by petitioner of an &quot;Electric Consumer&quot; publication would no longer qualify for the newspaper exemption from sales and use taxes. The court disagreed, stating first that the court had power, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 33-3-5-2(a)(1) (1996), to hear and determine any case arising under the state's tax laws and that followed, as here, a final determination by respondent. Moreover, the case was ripe for review, as respondent ruled that petitioner's publication was not a newspaper and, thus, was subject to sales and use taxes. As a result, a sufficient factual basis existed for petitioner's challenge. Finally, the court possessed jurisdiction over the case as petitioner satisfied all statutory prerequisites before filing its appeal. Jurisdiction under Ind. Code &sect; 33-3-5-11(a) (1996) would be lacking only if statutory requirements for a tax appeal were not met.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent state revenue department's motion to dismiss was denied, because the court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider petitioner's challenge, as court had statutory authority to hear &quot;ripe&quot; cases arising under state tax laws when petitioner had satisfied all statutory prerequisites for making appeal.</SPAN></P>

Local assessing officials valued the subject property's land and improvements. Petitioner filed for a review with respondent, the State Board of Tax Commissioners. Respondent's final determination lowered the subject property's total assessed value, but did not alter the subject improvement's grade. Petitioner contended that respondent improperly assessed a retaining wall and iron fence on the subject property, and incorrectly assigned the grade. The court held that petitioner was obligated to submit evidence of probative value before respondent's duty to support its final determination with substantial evidence was triggered. Petitioner failed to provide probative evidence on either the retaining wall or the grade, and those determinations were affirmed. However, the court found that respondent violated the agency's ascertainable standards requirement when it assessed the iron fence because petitioner's assessment regulations provided no standards whatsoever with respect to valuing iron fencing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent's final determinations as to retaining wall and assessed grade were affirmed because petitioner did not present probative evidence regarding either existence or value of wall or grade, therefore respondent was not required to support its final determinations with substantial evidence, but respondent's final determination as to iron fence was reversed and remanded because it violated the ascertainable standards requirement.</SPAN></P>

The issue was one of first impression. In deciding whether to apply the exception, the court relied on the three-factor, Serrano inquiry enunciated by the California Supreme Court and adopted by the Montana Supreme Court. Under this inquiry, the court concluded that the exception was applicable because petitioners: (1) vindicated a constitutional principle of substantial importance, i.e., the state could not arbitrarily assess property taxes; (2) enforcement of the Property Taxation Clause, Ind. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, resulted in a significant burden on petitioners' time and resources; and (3) all Indiana citizens would benefit from the litigation's outcome.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent Department of State Revenue issued petitioner a controlled substance excise tax (CSET) assessment based upon cocaine discovered in petitioner's safe deposit box.

Petitioner filed a protest with respondent, contesting the CSET, but agents executed a tax warrant, seized his belongings, and sold them. He appealed, arguing the exclusionary rule applied because the CSET was quasi-criminal in nature.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners requested that the court order respondent, board of tax commissioners, to adopt and implement new real property assessment regulations by dates certain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court entered an order requiring respondent board of tax commissioners to adopt and implement new real property assessment regulations, as the old regulations were unconstitutional. Petitioners later requested that the court order respondent to adopt and implement the new regulations by dates certain. The court found respondent failed to complete new regulations by the time frame indicated by respondent. The court held that reasons identified in the earlier order for not requiring the regulations by a date certain no longer applied. Work on the new regulations was halted by an order of the state governor. Respondent had done little to adopt or implement new regulations. Therefore, the executive branch had not been diligent and expeditious in creating and implementing new regulations. The court held further delays could not be justified and would not be tolerated. The court ordered respondent to take necessary steps to have new, constitutional assessment regulations promulgated and in effect by June 1, 2001, held that real property must be reassessed as of March 1, 2002, and set dates for other actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted petitioner's request and ordered respondent to adopt new, constitutional regulations no later than June 1, 2001, because respondent had failed to comply with an earlier order, and to take other actions by dates certain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners appealed a final determination of respondent Department of State Revenue assessing petitioner husband for motor vehicle excise tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, domiciliaries of Illinois, jointly owned a vehicle petitioner husband used to commute to and from work in Indiana. Respondent Department of State revenue assessed motor vehicle taxes--current and for prior years--against petitioners for the vehicle, and petitioner's appealed respondent's final determination. The tax court reversed. Although petitioner husband maintained a room in a boarding house where he frequently stayed during the work week, the court found that petitioner had not lived in Indiana for 183 days of the years for which taxes were being assessed--the court interpreted &quot;183 days&quot; to mean full, not partial days, and petitioners established that petitioner husband had been present in Indiana less than 4,392 hours in each of the relevant years. Further, absent a statute allowing dual registration of one car in two states, the court declined to require petitioner husband to violate his home state's laws by registering his car in Indiana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Agency decision reversed. Because petitioner husband had been in Indiana less than 4,392 hours in each of the relevant years, he had not lived in Indiana for 183 days of each of those years; therefore, he was no required to pay the Indiana motor vehicle tax.</SPAN></P>
