</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A circuit court adjudicated the child neglected, made the child a ward of the court, and placed the child under the legal guardianship of the Department of Children and Family Services. The appellate court reversed and ordered that guardianship and custody of the child be placed with respondent father. The Illinois Supreme Court denied the State's petition for leave to appeal but directed the appellate court to vacate its judgment and reconsider.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father contended that the trial court erred when it adjudicated the child a neglected minor. The appellate court found no error, noting that the mother stipulated to allegations that the mother failed to protect the child by failing to follow the safety plan of the Department of Children and Family Services and the father failed to present any rebuttal evidence. The father also contended that the trial court erred in ordering the father to complete a sexual offender evaluation and follow the resulting recommendations because there was no law or fact to support such an order. The appellate court agreed, noting that the complete lack of evidence against the father led to the conclusion that the trial court's actions were both an abuse of discretion and against the manifest weight of the evidence. The mother's stipulation stating that allegations of sexual molestation had been made was the only &quot;evidence&quot; that the trial court heard. The trial court could not order such an evaluation based only upon uncharged, unsubstantiated, and unproved allegations that were misconstrued as evidence; the State was required to prove the allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The finding of neglect was affirmed. The trial court's dispositional order was reversed and the case was remanded for a new dispositional hearing.</SPAN></P>

He appealed, and contended that the trial court erred in not considering, as a sentencing credit, time he served under probation, and whether his mandatory Sheriff's Work Alternative Program (SWAP) time was creditable as well. He also contended that his mittimus had to be corrected to reflect a one-day credit for time served prior to sentencing and to reflect the proper conviction. He also asked that his case be remanded for a determination as to crediting with respect to his probation and SWAP time. The appellate court found that the State had conceded that defendant was entitled to a one-day credit for presentence time that he spent in custody and that the mittimus should be corrected to reflect that his conviction was for Class 2 offense of simple possession rather than a greater offense. It also found that it did not to consider his SWAP claim because the record did not show that he reported for it, and whether he should receive a credit for the probation, imposed due to a mistake by the State, had to be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee executors sued appellant state and county officials in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), alleging that the Illinois Legislature did not intend for 1993 Ill. Laws 30 to apply retroactively to their estates, that retroactive application violated Illinois constitutional law, and that 1993 Ill. Laws 30 was invalid. The court entered summary judgment in favor of the executors on the issue of retroactivity. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the parties contested the retroactive application and constitutionality of 1993 Ill. Laws 30, which amended 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/2 (2002) (amended 2004), and 1994 Ill. Laws 419, which enacted 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/3(c) (2004) during the pendency of the appeal, and whether the executors were entitled to attorney fees. The court found that the Illinois Legislature expressed its clear intent that the amendments to 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/2 were to be applied retroactively to the estates of people dying on or after January 1, 2003. Further, 1994 Ill. Laws 419 was clearly enacted to deal with the constitutional problem of out-of-state taxation associated with 1993 Ill. Laws 30. Thus, the retroactive application of 1993 Ill. Laws 30 was not barred by Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, the Illinois due process clause. Furthermore, the taxing scheme set out in 1994 Ill. Laws 419 did not violate federal notions of due process under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV. Finally, 1993 Ill. Laws 30 was not enacted in violation of the Illinois Constitution's three-readings rule under Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d). Accordingly, the executors were not entitled to attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for an accounting of the amount of refund due to one of the estates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kane County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a judgment that declared defendant city's lumber tax ordinance unconstitutional and granted summary judgment to plaintiff lumber company.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lumber company sold lumber and other building materials. It sold its products in two ways: (1) on-site sales generated at its retail centers, one of which was located within the city's corporate limits; and (2) off-site sales accepted at its central sales office. The lumber company and the village entered into an economic development agreement whereby the lumber company agreed to build a central sales office within the village in exchange for the village's promise to rebate to the lumber company a portion of its tax on the sales generated by the central sales office. All of the lumber company's off-site sales were accepted and processed at the village's office. The city promulgated an ordinance that would impose a tax on off-site sales of lumber accepted and processed at the village's office. After the lumber company filed a motion for summary judgment, the trial court granted that motion and declared the lumber tax unconstitutional. On appeal, the appellate court found that the ordinance operated extraterritorially because it taxed activity in the village and that the legislature had not expressly authorized such extraterritorial tax activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that he was entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the punishment applicable to predatory criminal sexual assault of a child violated the proportionate-penalties clause. He contended that the penalty for violation of &sect; 12-14.1(a)(1) was harsher than the penalties for offenses with identical elements, namely, predatory criminal sexual assault of a child while armed with a firearm, &sect; 12-14.1(a)(1.1) and predatory criminal sexual assault of a child involving the discharge of a firearm, &sect;&nbsp;12-14.1(a)(1.2). Examining the elements of the three crimes, the court found that the latter two crimes clearly included an element not found in &sect;&nbsp;12-14.1(a)(1), and therefore, the elements of the crimes were not identical. As a result, defendant failed to prove the punishment for predatory criminal sexual assault of a child violated the proportionate-penalties clause under the identical-elements test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first victim and the second victim were sitting in a car when defendant approached.

He was found guilty of armed robbery/armed with a firearm for shooting the second victim. He was then sentenced in each case. On appeal, the appellate court found that the two convictions regarding the first victim violated the one act, one crime rule, that his sentence for armed robbery violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois constitution, and that his sentence for armed robbery regarding the second victim was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of the delivery of one gram or more but less than 15 grams of a substance containing cocaine. The trial court sentenced defendant to six years' imprisonment, imposed a $ 2,000 drug assessment, and ordered defendant to submit a blood sample for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis. The Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) denied defendant's motion to reconsider sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that, pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/110-14 (2002), defendant was entitled to a $ 5-per-day credit toward the statutory drug assessment for the time defendant spent in custody prior to sentencing. The appellate court agreed, concluding that the $ 2,000 drug assessment, payable to the public treasury, was a fine. The appellate court noted that the assessment did not fall within the definition of a fee and more closely resembled a pecuniary punishment imposed as part of a sentence. The fact that &sect;&nbsp;110-14 allowed defendant to perform public service in lieu of monetary payment or that the payment of the assessment may be suspended if the offender entered a substance-abuse program did not detract from the punitive nature of the assessment. As for defendant's contention that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (Supp. 2003), which required defendant to submit specimens of blood, saliva, or tissue for entry into a computer database, was unconstitutional because it violated defendant's right to be free from unreasonable searches, the appellate court noted that the supreme court had already rejected such an argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was modified to reflect a credit of $ 1,710 against the $ 2,000 drug assessment. As modified, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

As a result of his conviction for aggravated kidnapping, defendant was required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/1 et seq. (2002) (Registration Act) and the Sex Offender and Child Murderer Community Notification Law, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 152/101 et seq. (2002) (Notification Act). Defendant appealed and claimed that the Registration Act and Notification Law were unconstitutional as applied to him because his crime did not have a sexual motivation or component. He also contended that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2002), which requires a blood sample for persons convicted of sexual offenses or found sexually dangerous, violated his constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure. The appellate court affirmed. It found that neither his due process, equal protection, or privacy rights were violated by the order that he register as a sex offender. It also found that the order that he provide a blood sample was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court then sentenced defendant and ordered him to give a blood sample for genetic testing pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2002). Defendant appealed his conviction and the order to provide the blood sample.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of two counts of concealment of a homicidal death in violation of 720 Ill.

He was then sentenced; he was also ordered to give a blood sample for genetic marker testing pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2002). On appeal, he argued that he was not convicted beyond a reasonable doubt of one of the counts of concealment, that of the first victim, because the evidence showed that the victim was still alive when the concealment occurred. He additionally argued that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2002), regarding the provision of a blood sample for genetic marker testing, was unconstitutional. The appellate court agreed that evidence in the case showed that the first victim was not dead at the time the fire was set and, thus, the concealment conviction as to the first victim had to be reversed. However, the appellate court also found that the order requiring him to provide a blood sample for genetic marker testing was proper since 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2002) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated and remanded the cause to reconsider the instant court's judgment in light of People v. Sharpe and People v. Guevara. Defendant first asserted the State's evidence was insufficient to prove him guilty of home invasion beyond a reasonable doubt since he presented four alibi witnesses and the State's eyewitness testimony was &quot;suspect.&quot; The instant court found there was more than one witness who identified defendant as the perpetrator, and the Neil factors did not weigh in his favor. Since the perpetrator was in their home 20 to 25 minutes, the victims had many opportunities to view him. Defendant also argued that his 15-year sentence enhancement for home invasion while armed with a firearm was unconstitutional because it violated the proportionate-penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970)). The court disagreed. Like the defendants in Guevara, defendant argued the 15-year sentence enhancement for home invasion while armed with a firearm violated this clause under the cross-comparison analysis when compared to aggravated battery with a firearm. However, in Sharpe, the supreme court had abandoned the cross-comparison test.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/121 et seq. (2002), but did not have the requisite insurance certificate. The Department issued a cease and desist order. The corporation sought review. The Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit, Peoria County (Illinois) upheld the Department's determination. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation claimed that the Department erred because it had no administrative rule outlining a definition of insurance, and that the Department applied an improperly promulgated rule when it used the common law definition. The appellate court concluded that the common law was an acceptable means of providing the definition. The appellate court also concluded that, contrary to the corporation's contention, the Illinois Insurance Code was not void for vagueness because it gave an ordinary person no notice of what conduct was forbidden. Next, the appellate court concluded that the Department did not err in concluding that the corporation's activities constituted insurance business, subjecting it to the requirements of the Code. The corporation's Assisted Living Service Agreement clearly satisfied the first three elements of the definition of insurance in that it had a specified ending date, each customer paid a specified amount under the contract, and each customer acquired an interest in the care prescribed in the contract. As for the assumption of risk element, the appellate court found that the risk was shifted in a contingent manner, which was the essence of insurance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly accosted a man, his wife, and their 11-year-old son and demanded that the man give him money lest the man be shot.

He was then sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 19 years for armed robbery and 10 years for each aggravated unlawful restraint conviction. On appeal, he contended that the State failed to prove him guilty of armed robbery and that his convictions for aggravated unlawful restraint violated the one-act, one-crime doctrine. He also contended that the armed robbery statute under which he was convicted was void because its penalty provision violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution. The appellate court found that the armed robbery conviction was sufficiently supported. However, it found that one of the unlawful restraint convictions had to be vacated since it involved the same conduct as the armed robbery of the man, that the proportionate penalties clause had not been violated, and that a 15-year enhancement had to be imposed on his armed robbery sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed after he was convicted in the Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois) on a charge of home invasion. He asserted that the trial court misstated the law when answering a question by the jury during deliberations. He also asserted a claim that his enhanced sentence under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-11(c) (2002) was unconstitutionally disproportionate to the penalty for another crime with identical elements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant left the victim's home after an argument about a drug transaction. He later returned and entered the home. The victim was shot during a further altercation.  The court reversed. The jury instruction on home invasion indicated that defendant's entry into the victim's home was &quot;without authority&quot; if, at the time of entry, defendant had an intent to commit a criminal act within the home. But, if defendant entered the home without criminal intent, his entry was &quot;with authority&quot; regardless of what happened afterward. The jury's question was whether the &quot;criminal act&quot; that would destroy the authority to enter could include a drug deal. The trial court's response was that the instruction did not limit the type of crime. Because the victim was willing to let defendant into the home to complete the drug deal, the trial court's response resulted in conflicting instructions on whether defendant's entry was &quot;with&quot; or &quot;without&quot; authority. The response at least implied that defendant's intent to engage in the drug deal with the victim made his entry into the home &quot;without authority.&quot; But the victim had specifically authorized defendant to enter so that the drug deal could be completed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. Because it resolved the appeal on the instruction issue, it did not reach the constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois), which denied defendant's motion to reconsider the 60-year sentence imposed on defendant for first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he should receive a new hearing on the motion because he had not been properly admonished under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 605(a) and that he was denied the right to be present at the hearing on the motion to reconsider. Defendant, who acted pro se at the sentencing hearing and in filing the motion, failed to appear at the hearing. The trial court denied the motion without further input from the State or defendant. The court affirmed. Defendant was deprived of his right to be present when the trial court ruled on his motion in open court, however, the error was harmless. Defendant had not attempted to show how his presence at the hearing would have improved his chances of persuading the trial court that his motion was meritorious. Further, defendant's right to present oral argument was extremely limited and did not extend to the motion for reconsideration. Additionally, although defendant was not properly admonished under Rule 605, he actually did file a post-sentencing motion. Moreover, he had not suggested any additional issues that he would have raised in the motion had he received proper admonishments. Thus, defendant suffered no prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff licensee's driver's license was suspended for 12 months pursuant to 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-206(a)(38) (2002), she filed an action against defendant Illinois Secretary of State in which she sought administrative review of the Secretary's decision denying her petition for rescission or modification of the suspension. The Sangamon County Circuit Court (Illinois) affirmed the Secretary's decision. The licensee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee, who was 20 at the time, went to an establishment to dance. After dancing, she took two or three gulps of a friend's drink and then realized that it was mixed with alcohol. About 30 minutes later, police &quot;raided&quot; the establishment to catch underage drinkers. The licensee registered a 0.005 blood-alcohol concentration and was charged with violating a municipal code prohibiting the purchase or possession of alcohol by persons under 21. She pleaded guilty, and her license was suspended. After the licensee paid her fine and court costs, her case was dismissed. The court held that the Secretary abused his administrative discretion in not rescinding or substantially modifying the suspension. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 92, &sect; 1001.460(d) allowed the period of a discretionary suspension to be reduced for good cause shown. Here, the licensee had no prior revocations or suspensions and had voluntarily submitted to testing. Furthermore, the penalty imposed on the licensee was harsher than she would have received under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-208.2(a) (2002) had she violated the zero-tolerance statute,&nbsp;625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-501.8 (2002), by drinking and driving.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) judgment convicting him of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. He was ordered to pay a $ 1,000 drug assessment under &sect; 411.2(a)(3) (720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 570/411.2(a)(3) (2002)) of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act and $ 5 toward the Spinal Cord Injury Paralysis Cure Research Trust Fund pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-9-1.1(c) (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed his confrontation rights were violated because the record lacked any indication that his attorney informed him of the legal consequences of entering a stipulation as to the composition of the recovered substances and as to the chain of custody. However, defendant did not object to the stipulation as to the chain of custody and chemical composition of the recovered items. The decision to stipulate to a forensic chemist's testimony was a matter of trial strategy. In accordance with People v. Fort, defendant's $ 1,000 drug assessment pursuant to &sect; 411.2(a)(3) of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 570/411.2(a)(3) (2002), was a fine for which he was entitled to $ 5-per-day credit for the three days he was incarcerated pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/110-14 (2002). Defendant's due process rights were violated when the trial court ordered him to pay the $ 5 fee for the Fund pursuant to &sect; 5-9-1.1 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-9-1.1 (2002); the relationship between his crime of possession of a controlled substance and the Fund was too attenuated to survive his due process challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed but the costs and fees order was amended to reflect a credit of $ 15 against the $ 1,000 &quot;Assessment Controlled Substance,&quot; and the $ 5 fee for the &quot;Trauma Fund Spinal Cord&quot; was stricken from the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a doctor and health care entities, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which converted them from respondents in discovery (RIDs) to defendants under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-402 (2004) in a medical malpractice action by plaintiff mother, individually, and plaintiff father, individually and as administrator of his deceased son's estate. The trial court certified a question to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' eight-year-old son died as a result of the alleged negligence of various health care entities and individuals. Plaintiffs filed suit against multiple parties as RIDs. Prior to the expiration of the six-month conversion window of &sect; 2-402, plaintiffs' motions to extend the time for discovery and for conversion of RIDs were granted. Thereafter, the Robinson case was decided and several RIDs sought termination of their RID status. Plaintiffs moved to convert certain RIDs to defendants. The trial court granted plaintiffs' request and denied the RIDs' motions, as well as their motion for reconsideration, although the conversion occurred nine months after the Robinson modified decision. However, the trial court certified a question for appeal on the applicability of extending the conversion period. On appeal, the court interpreted the key phrases of the Robinson modified decision. It found that the case was filed prior to the date range of prospective application, and as defendants were named as RIDs prior to that date, the six-month period did not commence after the Robinson decision. The extension and conversion practice in place prior to Robinson was applicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question by holding that the trial court had discretion to extend the six-month statutory window for conversion of RIDs to defendants after the initial statutory window had expired. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a joint bench trial, both defendant and co-defendant were acquitted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver within 1,000 feet of a park but found guilty of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to six years' imprisonment in the Department of Corrections. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the evidence established that defendant had constructive possession of the cocaine. The evidence showed that defendant intended to aid co-defendant in the sale and delivery of cocaine. Co-defendant would engage in a conversation with a buyer and then direct the buyer across the street to give defendant the money. Co-defendant would then retrieve an item for a leaf pile and hand the item to the buyer. Defendant also contended that his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated by counsel's stipulation to the chain of custody and to the chemical composition of the recovered substance. The appellate court disagreed because the stipulation was not tantamount to a guilty plea and defendant was present in the courtroom at the time of the stipulation and failed to raise an objection. Finally, defendant contended that his Class X sentence was unconstitutional and violated Apprendi. The appellate court found no error, noting that the record was sufficient to establish defendant's eligibility for Class X sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed, and it was ordered that the mittimus be modified to reflect the offense of which defendant was convicted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile was convicted of the aggravated kidnapping of a minor. The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, imposed an indeterminate juvenile sentence and a 20-year adult sentence under the Illinois Extended Juvenile Jurisdiction Prosecutions Act, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/5-810 (2002), and required him to register as a sex offender under the Illinois Sex Offender Registration Act. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, 16, car-jacked a 17-year-old at knife-point and took his wallet. He argued that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 150/2(B)(1.5) of the Registration Act was unconstitutional as applied to him. He claimed that as there was no evidence he had a sexual motive for the kidnapping, requiring him to register as a sex offender violated his rights to privacy and to substantive and procedural due process under the state and U.S. Constitutions. The appellate court disagreed. The state supreme court had held that the Registration Act did not implicate the right to privacy under either Constitution. As to substantive due process, the legislature could have rationally concluded that kidnappers of children posed such a threat to sexually assault those children as to warrant their inclusion in the sex offender registry. His procedural due process rights were not violated, since he was able to contest the kidnapping charges at trial. The 20-year adult sentence, which would be executed only if he violated the conditions of his juvenile sentence, was not excessive in light of his prior criminal history, including the fact that he was on probation for robbery when he committed the crime.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-4(a)(3) (2000). The trial court sentenced defendant to natural life in prison, pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33B-1 (2002), because of defendant's criminal record. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim identified defendant as the person who stole the victim's truck through the use of a gun. Defendant was later found in possession of the truck. The victim identified a BB gun found in the truck as the weapon defendant used. On appeal, the court found that (1) the evidence was sufficient because the jury's finding that the BB gun could have been used as a dangerous weapon was not erroneous; (2) defendant's contention that his conviction required reversal as the proof at trial showed that he was armed with a firearm while the indictment alleged that he was armed with a bludgeon was without merit; (3) defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed as counsel's decision not to present a witness was a matter of sound trial strategy; (4) defendant's contention that he was denied a fair trial by the cumulative effect of the prosecutor's comments was without merit as none of the prosecutor's closing comments were erroneous; and (5) defendant's enhanced sentence under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33B-1 was constitutional as the timing and sequence of defendant's prior convictions were inherent in the convictions themselves and did not need to be submitted to a jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was not proved guilty of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt because the identification testimony against him was insufficient. The appellate court concluded that none of the claimed identification shortcomings, such as the fact that the gunman wore a hood or the fact that the incident happened quickly, rendered the testimony against defendant sufficiently unreliable that his convictions must be disturbed. Among other things, the appellate court noted that the witness' identification of defendant was consistent and that the identification was bolstered by the fact that the witness had encountered defendant on multiple occasions prior to the night of the shooting. The appellate court also concluded that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had an intent to kill, as he filed several shots at the victims. Next, the appellate court conclude that defendant's sentence was not an impermissible violation of the prohibition against sentence increases. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the trial court should have inquired further into defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kane County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a final judgment of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty in a second trial of aggravated vehicular hijacking while carrying a firearm in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-4(a)(4) (2002). The trial court then sentenced him to 14 years in prison. Defendant's first trial had ended in a mistrial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman and her passenger drove the pickup of the woman's mother to a store. Just then, a black man with a goatee approached. He pulled out a gun, told them he was going to take the pickup, let them get out, jumped in, and drove away. The woman later identified defendant in a photo array. Defendant's first jury trial ended when the trial court declared a mistrial after it was informed that the jury had deadlocked at 7 to 5. In defendant's second jury trial, the trial court instructed the jury on the charged offense of aggravated vehicular hijacking while carrying a firearm, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-4(a)(4) (2002), and on the lesser-included offense of vehicular hijacking, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-3(a) (2002). The jury found defendant guilty of the aggravated vehicular hijacking charge. It then sentenced defendant. On appeal, the appellate court found that the second jury trial did not violate defendant's double jeopardy rights, that his sentence violated the proportionate penalties clause and rendered 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-4(a)(4) (2002) void ab initio, and that a conviction of vehicular hijacking, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-3(a) (2002), was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment of conviction entered for aggravated vehicular hijacking was reversed and the sentence imposed thereon, 14 years in prison, was vacated. Also, the appellate court ordered that judgment be entered on a conviction of vehicular hijacking and the cause was remanded to the trial court to have defendant resentenced based on that conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because new DNA evidence established that the inmate was not physically connected to the crimes and, therefore, demonstrated the inmate's actual innocence. The inmate also contended that the trial court erred in denying the motion because the State presented false evidence and made untrue or incorrect arguments to the jury which prevented the inmate from being able to confront witnesses against him in violation of due process and the right to confrontation under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The appellate court determined that the trial court committed error in denying the petition because new DNA evidence demonstrated that the result upon retrial would have been different. The appellate court noted that the victim's impeaching prior inconsistent statement that she was not sexually assaulted, coupled with the State's own expert's incorrect testimony regarding the serology results, cast serious doubt as to whether the inmate committed aggravated or attempted aggravated criminal sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, the convictions of aggravated criminal sexual assault and attempted aggravated criminal sexual assault were reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially charged with all but two counts of home invasion. The two additional counts were not added until 116 days after the original charges were filed. On appeal, defendant argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to invoke his speedy-trial rights. The appellate court held that the State was responsible for the 116-day delay in filing the additional home invasion charges and that defendant was not responsible for any subsequent delay that defense counsel agreed to before the filing of the new charges and that did not actually delay the scheduled trial date. The appellate court concluded that the speedy-trial period expired three days after the new charges were filed, at which time counsel should have requested a speedy-trial discharge; counsel's failure could not be justified as a matter of trial strategy. Next, the appellate court concluded that any error in the trial court's jury instructions regarding identification testimony was not serious in light of the overwhelming evidence against defendant. Finally, the appellate court concluded that defendant was not entitled to a new trial, but merely a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, State of Illinois Motor Vehicle Review Board and a vehicle manufacturer, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which reversed the Board's dismissal of a protest filed by plaintiff dealership franchisee and remanded the protest to the Board for a hearing on the merits. The protest was filed under the Illinois Motor Vehicle Franchise Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 710/4(e)(8), 12(c) (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutory sections provided that a franchisor violated the Act if it relocated a dealership into the relevant market area of an existing franchisee without good cause and placed the good cause determination with the Board. The instant versions of the sections became effective in 1995. The court reversed. Prior versions of the statutory sections had been found unconstitutional and were void ab initio. There was no public policy basis for departing from the void ab initio doctrine to apply the earlier versions to plaintiff's 1989 franchise agreement. Thus, under plaintiff's agreement the manufacturer was not statutorily prohibited from relocating dealerships into plaintiff's relevant market area. Sections &sect;&sect; 4(e)(8) and 12(c) of the Act created a substantive right to challenge relocations. They could not be applied retroactively. Plaintiff had no common law right to protest dealer relocations on a good cause basis. Plaintiff had no third-party beneficiary rights under the manufacturer's contract with the relocated franchisee. Finally, applying the statutory sections to post-1995 franchise agreements but not to pre-1995 agreements did not violate equal protection concepts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois), which resentenced him to an extended-term of seven and a half years in prison on his admission to violating probation that was imposed on a guilty plea to aggravated battery. The extended term was imposed after a prior three-year sentence, which was ordered by a different judge, was vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received probation on a guilty plea to aggravated battery. He later admitted to a revocation petition (RP) before a judge who set a resentencing date. Before that date, a different judge, while sentencing defendant on two other matters, resentenced him on the RP to three years in prison. The judge who originally heard the RP vacated that sentence and resentenced defendant. On appeal, defendant argued it was improper to vacate the three-year sentence as it was imposed by a judge with jurisdiction. The State responded that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-1(b) (2004) mandated that the judge who accepted the plea on the RP had to impose a sentence. The court found that, if &sect; 5-4-1(b) was mandatory rather than directory, it would encroach on a constitutionally authorized court rule at Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 21(b) conferring power to the circuit's chief judge to assign judges and would thereby violate the separation of powers under Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. Allowing the first judge to increase the three year sentence would violate the prohibition against increasing a lawfully imposed sentence under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(c) (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded with directions to reinstate the three-year sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee business operators filed suit in the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois), to enjoin appellant railroad from stopping its trains at a crossing and thereby obstructing a public road for more than 10 minutes in violation of 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18c-7402(1)(b) (2002). The circuit court granted a permanent injunction that prevented the railroad from obstructing the crossing for greater than 10 minutes. The railroad appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business operators alleged that the railroad crossed a public road which was the only means to get to and from the operators' business facilities, that the railroad's trains often blocked the public road to motor vehicles for 15 to 45 minutes at a time, that the repeated obstruction of the public road deprived the operators of the right to use their properties and compromised public health and safety, and that the operators had sustained irreparable harm and had no adequate remedy at law. The railroad claimed that the operators did not have a private right of action under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18c-7402(1)(b) and that the action was preempted by the Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1994, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 20101 - 20153 (2000); the ICC Termination Act of 1995, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 10101 - 16106 (2000); and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. On appeal, the court found that the operators had an implied private right of action under &sect; 18c-7402(1)(b), that the operators' action was not preempted by federal law, and that there was sufficient testimonial evidence to satisfy the requirements for a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant note holder appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois) awarding plaintiff borrower $ 500,000 in punitive damages in the borrower's action against the note holder alleging conversion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borrower sued the note holder for conversion after the note holder caused the borrower's car to be repossessed after the borrower had paid the car loan in full. The note holder was unresponsive to the borrower's attempts to seek the return of items stolen from her car during the repossession. The trial court awarded $ 25,000 in compensatory damages. The $ 500,000 punitive damages award was excessive and violated due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. With regard to the reprehensibility of the note holder's conduct, the harm was economic rather than physical. There was no evidence that the note holder was aware of the borrower's financial vulnerability. The borrower presented evidence that the note holder had committed wrongful repossessions more than one time, but there was no specific evidence as to how many times. There was no evidence of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit. The punitive damages award was 20 times larger than the amount of compensatory damages. A punitive damages award of $ 225,000 was constitutional, as the award would have been less than the double-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages against which case law had cautioned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as modified. The case was remanded for a remittitur to reduce to the judgment to $ 225,000, unless the borrower did not consent, in which case there was to be a new trial on the issue of the amount of punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner and two other inmates tried to escape from a prison operated by the State.

The prisoner then tried to mail the report to a community activist. Defendant captain and defendant warden refused to allow him to do so. The prisoner filed a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action and claimed that the refusal violated his First Amendment rights. The Attorney General's office represented the government representatives. The prisoner's attorney moved to disqualify the Attorney General's office, but the motion was denied. The trial court granted summary judgment to all of the government representatives, including the captain and warden. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed the denial of the motion to disqualify, but agreed with the prisoner as to the captain and warden that the refusal to allow him to mail the report, under circumstances where the report was part of a public record, violated his First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of eight counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and two counts of home invasion with a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a home invasion, a gun was used, and a victim was sexually assaulted. Defendant was convicted of various crimes, and he sought review. On appeal, the reviewing court determined that it was unclear whether or not defendant waived his rights under the Confrontation Clause. An evidentiary hearing was required to determine if defendant had forfeited the privilege to confront a witness because he wrongfully procured his silence by writing a letter regarding his testimony. Next, the reviewing court held that the sentence did not violate the prohibition against double enhancement. The firearm factor under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-14(a) (2002) was used only once, which was to enhance defendant's sentence. However, the 15-year mandatory add-on provision under &sect; 12-14(d) violated Ill Const. art. I, &sect; 11 because aggravated criminal sexual assault was punishable more severely than the identical offense of armed violence predicated on a sexual assault. Finally, a similar challenge to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-11(a)(3) (2002) was rejected because the cross-comparison test under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;11 was no longer used, and no other viable ground was asserted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions and sentences were vacated and remanded with instructions to determine whether defendant waived his rights under the Confrontation Clause. If he did waive the rights, the trial court was directed to reinstate convictions for four sexual assaults and one home invasion. Resentencing was required on the sexual assaults only. If defendant did not waive his constitutional rights, a new trial was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of the first degree murder of her infant grandson.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction. Among other things, there was expert testimony opining that the victim's death was not a case of overlay or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. In addition, a paramedic testified that copious amounts of water came out of the baby after she turned him over and administered back blows. The appellate court further concluded that defendant knowingly waiver her right to a jury trial, noting that she acknowledged that she understood the meaning of a jury trial and specifically stated to the court that she was giving up that right. Defendant's ineffective assistance claim also failed where defendant failed to demonstrate that there was reasonable probability that, but for her attorney's decision not to subpoena prior to trial the past autopsy records of the coroner, the outcome would have been different. Nor did defendant show that she was prejudiced by counsel's failure to impeach the state's expert; the trial court was aware that the expert did not personally perform a test on the baby's eyes and that the outside expert's report showed no hemorrhages in the white's of the baby's eyes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court of the 21st Judicial Circuit, Kankakee County, Illinois, that dismissed his injunction and declaratory judgment action against defendants, a county board and a sanitation company, pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-615 (2002) on the sole basis that he was required to bring his action in quo warranto under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-101 (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen alleged that the county board adopted an ordinance that changed the method of electing its members and that the board failed to hold a referendum to approve the change in method of electing board members as required by Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3(b). Specifically, the citizen alleged that the board was not able to accept the sanitation company's filing of its request for site location approval, nor make any binding decision on its request. The appellate court held that because the citizen's complaint challenged the validity of the board's authority to act, a proceeding in quo warranto was an appropriate and adequate remedy. Because neither 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-101 (2002) nor case law expressly made quo warranto an exclusive remedy, the trial court erred in dismissing the citizen's complaint on that basis under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the trial court's Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 605(b) admonishments, defense counsel indicated that defendant wanted to file a motion for reconsideration of sentence and to correct a void sentence. The motion was denied. On appeal, defendant argued that remand was necessary because defense counsel failed to file an Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d) certificate. The State argued that no Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d) certificate was necessary because defendant was acting pro se when he filed his motion to reconsider sentence. Defendant had asked for appointment of counsel. Defense counsel stated that defendant wanted to file a pro se motion for reconsideration of sentence and to correct a void sentence. These actions, alone, did not suggest that defendant elected to proceed pro se. Remand was necessary, as strict adherence to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d) was required. Classification of defendant as a sex offender because aggravated kidnapping was a sex offense under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/2(B)(1.5) (2000) violated due process, as the crime was not sexually motivated and there were no allegations of any sexual offense in the case.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the trustee argued 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3.1-10-5(b) (2002) violated equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the statutory scheme allowed a convicted felon to run for a constitutional office after completion of the sentence, but it did not restore the same rights to a felon seeking a nonconstitutional elective office. The court found there was a rational basis for the distinction that was related to the legitimate state interest in maintaining the public trust in local elective offices, which had much more freedom over fiscal decisions and were subject to less oversight than constitutional office holders. Requiring a pardon by the governor under Ill. Const. art. V, &sect; 12, before a felon could have the right to seek elective office restored was a legitimate way to meet that goal. Since a rational basis existed for the legislature's distinction between qualifications for office holders, there was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, usually considered a Class 3 felony. Because the victim was defendant's son, the offense was elevated to a Class 2 felony. 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3(f) (2000). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to 12 years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3(a) (2000) was unconstitutional because it violated his right to due process. Defendant contended that the statute bore no rational relationship to the legislature's stated purpose, to fight and deter domestic violence. Defendant alleged that &sect; 9-3(f) was not reasonably designed to implement the legislature's purpose because involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional act, and an unintentional act could not be deterred by an enhanced penalty. The appellate court concluded that &sect; 9-3(f) was constitutional. The appellate court concluded that the plain language of &sect;&nbsp;9-3(f) made it clear that the legislature intended the penalty for involuntary manslaughter to be more severe under certain circumstances. The appellate court saw no reason why the legislature could not have created an additional offense of involuntary manslaughter against a family or household member, imposing a Class 2 penalty. The appellate court also found no merit in defendant's challenge to the compulsory extraction and perpetual storage of his DNA, as such had previously been held constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction, sentence, and entry of the DNA order were affirmed. The costs and fees order was amended to reflect a credit of $ 5,000 against defendant's $ 5,000 fine, and the mittimus was amended to reflect a 1,226-day sentencing credit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court merged the charges into two counts of home invasion and imposed sentences accordingly. On appeal, defendant argued that the State's delayed filing of the home invasion charges violated his speedy-trial rights and, thus, his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to move for their dismissal, that the trial court erred in instructing the jury regarding eyewitness identification testimony, and that the two convictions of home invasion violated the one-act, one crime principle. The State conceded the one-act, one-crime violation. The appellate court then found that the State's delayed filing of the home invasion charge violated his speedy-trial right and, thus, his counsel was ineffective for not seeking dismissal of those charges. It also found that defendant waived the jury instruction issue by not objecting at trial and that the plain-error doctrine did not entitle him to relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed a document with the agency which the corporation called an application for modification of its operating permit. The appellate court found that, in reality, the corporation was trying to transform its &quot;local&quot; pollution control facility into a &quot;regional&quot; pollution control facility. The application was correctly denied by the agency and board as an attempt to operate a regional pollution control facility without first obtaining the necessary siting approval. The corporation challenged the limitations contained within a special condition of its permit, which it requested and failed to object to for approximately 10 years. The slight burden the permit imposed on interstate commerce did not outweigh the benefits that the permittees and the village enjoyed when the facility was established. This case involved a private entity that made a choice to forego the siting process more than 12 years earlier when it had that option. The special condition was not unconstitutionally vague. The corporation had no problem deciphering the condition for 10 years, and seemed to clearly understand the terms when it applied for a permit that did not require siting approval.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1991, the inmate was convicted of armed robbery, armed violence, and aggravated robbery. The inmate was sentenced to serve consecutive 30-year prison terms. The instant postconviction petition was the fourth filed by the inmate. The inmate filed the instant petition pro se in 2004. The inmate alleged that the State failed to disclose the victim's statement made at the hospital after the alleged attack and that this statement differed substantially from the victim's testimony at trial. In dismissing the petition, the trial court found that the petition did not comply with 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1(f) (2004). Section 122-1(f) required the inmate to obtain leave of court before filing a successive postconviction petition. Thus, the trial court could have properly dismissed the inmate's successive postconviction petition on the basis that the inmate had failed to obtain leave of court before filing the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) sentencing him to concurrent prison terms of 45 years for armed robbery, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-2(a)(1) (2002), seven years for unlawful use of a weapon by a felon, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.1(a) (2002), and 45 years for home invasion, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was represented in the trial court by a public defender. Nevertheless, defendant filed several pro se, pretrial motions. On appeal, defendant argued that his Fifth Amendment right to due process and his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation were violated when the trial court refused to hear the pro se motions. Defendant was not entitled to representation of counsel and to self-representation at the same time. As a result, defendant was not permitted to file the pro se, pretrial motions that addressed strategic matters under counsel's control. While a defendant was permitted to file a pro se ineffective assistance of counsel claim, none of defendant's pro se motions at issue raised claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant argued that his 15-year sentence enhancement under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-11(c) (2002) for home invasion violated the proportionate penalties clause. The enhancement was not declared unconstitutional when defendant was sentenced. 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-11(a)(3) was not vague. That provision clearly applied a 15-year sentence enhancement to home invasion as prescribed by 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-11(a)(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that: (1) the trial court committed reversible error in admitting hearsay evidence that the quality assurance department agreed with the testifying forensic scientist's conclusion that fingerprints found at the scene of the crime matched defendant's; (2) there was error in sentencing him as a Class X offender pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3(c)(8) (2002) when his presentencing investigation report (PSI) did not show he committed his first qualifying felony subsequent to the date required by the statute; and (3) &sect; 5/5-5-3(c)(8) was unconstitutional. The court agreed that defendant waived his challenge to the admission of hearsay evidence by failing to object. Regardless, even though the testimony was inadmissible hearsay, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt so that reversal was not warranted. Moreover, defendant waived his right to a jury prior to trial, so any contention that a jury was required to determine beyond a reasonable doubt the facts necessary to impose Class X offender status was waived. Finally, the court found that &sect; 5/5-5-3(c)(8) was constitutional under the recidivism exception to the Apprendi doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building owner was the owner of a building at a particular location, which defendant city's building inspector observed and alleged violated the Chicago Building Code, specifically Chicago, Ill., Mun.

At trial, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found him liable and imposed a fine of $ 500. On administrative review to the trial court, the ALJ's judgment was affirmed. The building owner appealed. The appellate court found that building owner was not deprived of his due process rights to a full and fair administrative hearing because he never requested that the ALJ force the building inspector to appear for cross-examination about what was contained in the inspector's violation report, the ALJ did not find that the city's evidence was inherently more credible that the evidence of the building owner, Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 13-196-530(b) (1990) was not unconstitutional, and the ALJ did not act unreasonably in assessing the maximum daily fine, especially since only one day's fine was imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed that defendant voluntarily accompanied two plain clothed detectives to the police station, believing he was a witness as opposed to a suspect on three separate dates, January 16, 17, and 18, 1999, with regard to the murder. Defendant asserted on appeal that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him on the 16th since the police had no warrant and did not observe him committing a crime. Defendant further asserted on appeal that his statement made on the 18th was involuntary. The court found that defendant's incriminating statement was the product of his arrest without probable cause, his poor education, his limited intelligence, his poor health, his sleeping conditions, his lack of facilities to bathe, his restricted use of the restroom, and his 54-hour illegal detention. As such, defendant's statement was not an act of free will and required suppression.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 4-156-150, 4-156-190, and 4-156-280, which prohibited and authorized the seizure of certain illegal amusement devices.

The ordinances clearly described exactly what components would make a device illegal, so as to satisfy due process, and were narrowly tailored to limit only amusement activities involving a narrow range of machines. The procedures for seizure and subsequent proceedings were also constitutionally proper. The mechanical components prohibited were those that made the devices gambling machines, and gambling was an activity subject to regulation and complete prohibition by ordinance. Furthermore, the seizures authorized by the scheme were only temporary, and devices could only be destroyed after a full administrative hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was allegedly involved with two codefendants in the attempted robbery of a grocery store. Multiple charges resulted including a murder charge because one person was shot to death during the attempted robbery. Each of the codefendants was tried in a separate trial regarding the attempted robbery. Defendant was then tried. The trial court, pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10.2 (2002), published to the jury the custodial statements and prior testimony of the two codefendants; neither of them testified at defendant's trial. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the appellate court found that while 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10.2 (2002) did not facially violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause, the admission of the custodial statements and prior testimony of the two codefendants violated defendant's rights to confront witnesses because defendant did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the codefendants either during the interrogations that resulted in their statements or during their testimony at their separate trials.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DuPage County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a judgment that reversed defendant board of commissioner's decision to terminate plaintiff firefighter's employment and ordered him to be reinstated. It found that the prior decision of defendant pension fund to deny disability benefits to him was res judicata on whether he could be terminated due to a disability. The board of commissioners, the pension fund, and other defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighter sought administrative review against the board of commissioners, the pension fund, and other defendants from a decision of the board of commissioners to discharge him from his employment as a firefighter. The board of commissioners had found he was unable and unwilling to perform. The trial court reversed the decision and ordered the firefighter reinstated. The trial court reasoned that a prior administrative decision of the pension fund denying disability benefits to the firefighter was res judicata and barred the board of commissioners from discharging the firefighter. On appeal, the appellate court found that the pension fund's prior decision finding that the firefighter was not entitled to a disability pension did not bar the board of commissioners in a subsequent proceeding from finding that the firefighter could be terminated due to a disability. It so held because it found that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel did not prevent the subsequent decision since the board of commissioners, a nonparty to the earlier decision, was not bound by the earlier proceeding that involved a party to the current proceeding, the firefighter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for relief from judgment (735 Ill. Comp. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court found that the trial court properly rejected the petition. Defendant asserted that the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/1 through 99 (1998), was unconstitutional, but that argument had been rejected by the supreme court. He claimed the jury violated its instructions, the State's witnesses repeatedly perjured themselves, and the State presented prejudicial testimony of uncharged offenses. Some of those arguments were made, or could have been made, in the direct appeal, and defendant's affidavits and other materials were not sufficient to show the existence of a meritorious defense or claim. Defendant asserted his counsel was ineffective in failing to object to certain testimony, to introduce letters and other evidence, to investigate the claims and credentials of the experts, and to expose lies &quot;which are too numerous to list exhaustively here.&quot; Defendant was represented by new counsel on his direct appeal. No reason appeared why the claims defendant now made could not have been raised on direct appeal. Also, his affidavits and other materials did not establish that any other action by counsel would have changed the outcome.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him on eight counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and two counts of home invasion with a firearm, and which sentenced him to a total of 84 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and the imposition of his sentence upon application of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-14 (2002). He raised five arguments, but the court found dispositive defendant's argument that admission of a codefendant's statement as an unavailable witness violated his U.S. Const. amend. VI confrontation right. The court agreed since he never had an opportunity to cross-examine. However, the State raised a valid issue on whether defendant committed wrongdoing that caused the codefendant's unavailability, which would waive his right to raise the confrontation issue. However, whether defendant waived the right was a factual issue that required the court to vacate defendant's convictions and remand for a fact hearing on whether defendant waived his right. If defendant did not waive the right, the court ordered a new trial. If defendant waived the right, the court ordered the home invasion conviction and sentence reinstated. It also ordered four of the assault convictions reinstated, but a new sentencing hearing was required because the 15 year mandatory add-on provision of &sect; 5/12-14(d)(1) violated the proportionality clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's convictions and remanded with directions for a hearing on whether defendant forfeited his right under the confrontation clause to challenge the admission of an unavailable witness's out-of-court statement. If he did, four aggravated criminal assault and one home invasion convictions were reinstated, along with the sentencing on the home invasion, but a new sentencing hearing was required on the assault convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A student found with marijuana told authorities that defendant had sold him the drugs. As defendant was walking from his house to his friend's car, an unmarked police car screeched to a stop in front of the friend's car. A police officer ordered defendant to come to the police car. The officer told defendant he knew about the drugs in his backpack. The officer told defendant open his backpack, and defendant complied. The officer found marijuana in a locked box. The officers then led defendant into the home and searched the residence, uncovering more marijuana. On appeal, defendant argued that the marijuana was inadmissible because his consent to the search was involuntary. The appellate court held that defendant was seized when the officer told him that he knew defendant had marijuana in his backpack. Therefore, the appellate court found that defendant's consent to the search was not voluntary. In light of the circumstances surrounding the request to search the home, the appellate court held that a reasonable person in defendant's position would not have felt free to leave. Therefore, defendant's consent to the search of the home was deemed involuntary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) that convicted him of disorderly conduct under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/26-1 (2000) and sentenced him to two years' probation; defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient, that his counsel was ineffective, and that a probation condition was unreasonable and constitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the victim saw a &quot;flash&quot; outside her bay window, she saw defendant standing outside the window with his shorts unzipped and his hand moving up and down rapidly near his genital area. Defendant ran away when he saw the victim go to her telephone. The police found spots containing a &quot;milky, creamy&quot; substance on the right edge of the porch. A condition of defendant's probation stated that he could not enter any school, park, or forest preserve. The circumstantial evidence, when considered collectively, gave rise to a reasonable inference that defendant was looking into the victim's house through the window in violation of &sect; 5/26-1. Although defense counsel assumed that defendant looked into the window, the questions were not needed to establish the window-peeping element of the offense. Accordingly, defendant was not prejudiced by counsel's performance. The probation condition did not contain any terms or exceptions to its geographic application as required by 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-6-3(b)(14) (2002). Therefore, the condition was not narrowly drawn and was unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated as to the probation condition; it was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers saw the driver of a Lexus fire three or four shots through the passenger window at a group of people standing in front of a Blues Lounge. The officers pursued the Lexus, engaging the squad car's siren and emergency lights. The officer estimated that the Lexus' speed was approximately 70 to 80 miles per hour on a street with a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour. Defendant was convicted of armed violence, unlawful use of a weapon, and aggravated fleeing or attempting to elude. On appeal, the court found that armed violence occurred if a defendant committed a felony while having on or about his person a dangerous weapon or if a defendant was otherwise armed, and that that clearly occurred here, where defendant was shown to have a loaded handgun in his possession while fleeing from or attempting to elude police. The court found that if ever there was a felony offense during which the use of a deadly weapon should be deterred, it was a high-speed flight from or attempt to elude police. As such, the court found that the 15 year sentence, though harsh, was not cruel degrading, or so grossly disproportionate to the offense as to shock the moral sense of the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Lake County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered final judgments of conviction after defendant was found guilty by it of two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in violation of 720 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a respite care worker, was charged due to his conduct in supervising the victim. The victim was a 12-year-old child with a reported full scale IQ of 49. Defendant met the victim when the victim's mother sought respite care for the victim from defendant's employer. Eventually, based on defendant's alleged conduct in touching the victim's penis, defendant was charged with aggravated criminal sexual abuse in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-16(c)(1)(i) (2002). Over defendant's objections, out-of-court statements the victim made to a subsequent respite care worker and an investigator were admitted at defendant's bench trial pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10 (2002). The victim testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the appellate court found that none of the statements admitted violated Crawford because the victim testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination, the statements were properly admitted pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10(b)(3) (2002), and no error occurred in finding that the statements were reliable as that term was used in 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10 (2002).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which convicted defendant of drug-induced homicide, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3.3(a) (2004) and involuntary manslaughter, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3(a) (2004), with regard to one victim, and the criminal sexual assault of another victim, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-13(a)(2) (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms of 20 years for drug-induced homicide, five years for involuntary manslaughter, and 11 years for criminal sexual assault. Defendant's convictions arose from a drug party at a house wherein the dead victim overdosed on methadone that belonged to defendant. The sexual assault allegedly occurred early in the morning with another victim. The court found that while the evidence was not overwhelming, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions of criminal sexual assault and of drug-induced homicide or involuntary manslaughter. Because the trial court erred in failing to sever the sex offense and homicide charges, however, defendant was entitled to a new trial. The court agreed with defendant that the sex offense and homicide charges arose from distinct acts affecting two different victims and that an intervening event of defendant travelling into Chicago with the alleged sex-offense victim also added to the finding that the charges did not arise from the same comprehensive transaction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's convictions and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings, noting that the court's disposition considered other issues raised in the appeal that might arise again on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by indictment with two counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child under 720 Ill.

The appellate court found no error, noting that the victim testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination; as such, none of the statements admitted pursuant to &sect;&nbsp;115-10 were improper under Crawford. Defendant also argued that he was entitled to a new trial because 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10(b)(3) rendered the victim's hearsay statements, testified to by a respite worker and an investigator, statutorily inadmissible. The appellate court disagreed, concluding that the victim's status as mentally retarded permitted the admission of the statements. Finally, defendant contended that the State failed to establish the time, content, and circumstances of the hearsay statements at issue were reliable within the meaning of &sect;&nbsp;115-10. The appellate court found no error, noting the victim's use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age and the consistent repetition of the child's statements; the descriptive terms used were those expected from a child and supported the conclusion that the statements were reliable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from that portion of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that required him, upon conviction of drug possession, to pay a $ 500 assessment without allowing a 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/110-14 (2002) credit for pretrial incarceration. Defendant further argued that assessment of an additional five dollar assessment and a DNA sampling requirement were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was for simple possession. That conviction called for imposition of a $ 500 assessment under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 570/411.2 (2002). Defendant had been jailed pending trial, and had not been able to make bail, so he argued that he should receive a credit of five dollars a day against the assessment under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/110-14 (2002). Although the State argued that the assessment was not a fine to which the credit applied, the court found no basis for that argument in either the plain language of the statute or its legislative history. The credit made it unnecessary to consider whether defendant could afford to pay the full assessment. The court further found that there was no rational relationship between an assessment of five dollars to benefit a fund benefiting victims of spinal cord injuries and a conviction of simple drug possession. Therefore, imposition of that assessment violated due process. Finally, it was already settled law that a requirement that convicted felons submit DNA samples did not violate substantive due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment to allow the credit for pretrial incarceration and to set aside the five dollar assessment but otherwise affirmed the judgment in all respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of aggravated battery under 720 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Members of defendant's family called the paramedics because they believed he was ill. Fire department paramedics responded to the call. Defendant was unresponsive, and paramedics believed that he was intoxicated and feigning unconsciousness. It was Chicago fire department policy that intoxicated individuals were to be transported to the hospital. As one of the paramedics wrapped his arms under defendant's armpits and attempted to grab defendant's wrists to prop him up, defendant became combative and bit the paramedic's left forearm. Defendant was convicted of aggravated battery. On appeal, the court found that the evidence clearly proved defendant guilty of aggravated battery because it showed that he knowingly bit an on-duty fireman on the arm causing him bodily harm. The court found also that the indictment clearly identified the victim, the nature of the incident, and the date and place of the incident and that the judgment could be presented to bar subsequent prosecution for the same conduct, preventing the risk of double jeopardy. Lastly, the court rejected defendant's objections to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4-3, noting that it previously upheld the statute as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a judgment that found defendant guilty of two counts of defacing firearm identification marks and two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of two counts of defacing firearm identification marks and two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon (UUW). On appeal, defendant contended that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-5(b) (2002), regarding the defacing of firearm identification marks, contained an unconstitutional mandatory presumption that relieved the State of its burden of proving that a defendant knowingly or intentionally defaced the identifying marks on a firearm beyond a reasonable doubt, that his multiple convictions of defacing a firearm and multiple convictions of aggravated UUW violate the one-act, one-crime doctrine, that the trial court's mistaken belief that aggravated UUW was a Class 3, rather than a Class 4, felony influenced its sentencing decision, that he was prejudiced when the trial court failed to completely admonish him of his appellate rights, and that compulsory extraction of his DNA as part of his sentence violated his constitutional rights. The appellate court found that the statute was unconstitutional for the reason he described, agreed that the one-act, one-crime doctrine had been violated, and rejected his remaining contentions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgments of conviction finding defendant guilty on two counts of defacing a firearm and one of the two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon were reversed. However, the trial court's judgment of conviction on the second of two counts of aggravated unlawful use of weapon and the sentence associated with that conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed that portion of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Vermilion County (Illinois) that imposed an enhanced sentence on him, under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (2002), after he was found guilty of armed robbery. He argued that the sentencing statute was unconstitutional in permitting an increased sentence without a jury or even a judge having found the existence of a prior felony conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of attempted murder had occurred within 10 years before his armed robbery conviction. He never contested the records of his past felony convictions, and he received an enhanced sentence. At that point, he challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 5-5-3.2(b)(1), arguing that earlier cases finding that the scheme did not violate the rule of Apprendi had been wrongly decided. The court adhered to its earlier holdings of constitutionality, noting that the nation's highest court had expressly reserved a recidivism exception to the rule otherwise requiring jury findings. Furthermore, the fact of the prior conviction did not have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt because it was not an element of the armed robbery offense of which defendant was being convicted, but simply a sentencing factor. Therefore, the trial court could rely on the information in the presentence report, the accuracy of which defendant had not challenged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly forced the victim, his 10-year-old stepdaughter, to perform oral sex on him. Defendant's wife investigated and called police. The victim allegedly told the wife and police that defendant had forced her to have oral sex not only on that occasion, but also on an earlier occasion. Defendant was charged with one count of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. In a pretrial hearing, the trial court ruled that the victim's out-of-court statements to her mother and the police would be admissible pursuant to the statutory exception to the hearsay rule, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10 (2002). At trial, the State called the victim as a witness and also presented her hearsay statements. The jury found defendant guilty. On appeal, the appellate court found that evidence of the uncharged sex offense was admissible pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-7.3 (2002). It also found that because the victim testified and was subject to cross-examination, the admission of her hearsay statements did not violate the Confrontation Clause.

Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/25-1(a)(2) (2004). In all cases, defendants received dismissal of the mob action charges due to a preexisting injunction from a federal court that enjoined enforcement of &sect; 25-1(a)(2). The State appealed and the court consolidated those appeals. The court found that the injunction was still in effect, even though a ruling that the statute was unconstitutional was reversed, and that injunction precluded the State from prosecuting each defendant for the mob action crime. The court rejected the State's contention that the injunction only applied to the parties in the federal action. A controlling decision from the state supreme court held that the injunction was still in effect and that the State had no valid basis for refusing to honor the injunction. Since that decision was controlling precedential authority, the court upheld the decisions that the mob action charges could not be enforced while the injunction was still valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers executed a search warrant at a house. One officer noticed a backpack lying on the living room floor. The backpack had protruding from it a plastic bag containing what appeared to be cannabis.

Defendant then conceded that he was familiar with the bag and had been smoking the cannabis from the bag. At a trial in absentia, he was found guilty of possession of cannabis in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 550/4(d) (2002). He was sentenced and given a credit for time spent in prejudgment incarceration. Pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2002), he was also required to submit to mandatory genetic testing. On appeal, the appellate court found that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction and the trial court did not err in ordering the reimbursement of attorney fees without determining defendant's ability to pay since defendant's trial was in absentia.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1995, defendant pled guilty to armed violence. Because of the Safe Neighborhoods Act, his minimum sentence was 10 years. In Cervantes, the state supreme court declared the Safe Neighborhoods Act to be unconstitutional. Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 et seq. (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the lateness of his petition was not due to his culpable negligence because the basis for his petition, the Illinois Supreme Court's decision in Cervantes, did not arise until four years after his conviction. The appellate court concluded that defendant was not culpably negligent for failing to file his post-conviction petition during the period before Cervantes was decided. However, defendant was culpably negligent based on the time period that elapsed between the decision in Cervantes, issued in December 1999, and the filing of his petition on May 27, 2003. Defendant offered no reason for his delay in filing a petition until over 40 months after Cervantes was issued. Thus, the trial court should have granted the State's motion to dismiss defendant's petition as untimely. In addition, defendant's conviction and sentence were not void, but merely voidable. Thus, he could not challenge them at any time in any proceeding as he could a void judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lost control of his vehicle as he drove down an interstate entrance ramp. The vehicle rolled over. A state trooper questioned defendant at the scene. According to the trooper, defendant had bloodshot eyes, slurred his speech, and smelled of alcohol. Defendant admitted to having consumed a couple of beers. Defendant was taken to the hospital. Shortly after defendant arrived, the trooper arrested him for driving under the influence in violation of 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-501(a)(2) (2002). Based on defendant's blood test, he was charged with the offense of which he was convicted. Defendant argued that the trooper lacked probable cause to arrest him. Defendant pointed to inconsistencies in the trooper's testimony. Defendant failed to point to any inconsistencies in the trooper's testimony regarding the indicia of intoxication. The trial court's finding that the inconsistencies in defendant's testimony did not impeach the remaining testimony was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Probable cause existed to arrest defendant, as he rolled his vehicle over, exhibited indicia of intoxication, and admitted to having consumed beer before driving.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) convicting him of armed robbery, home invasion, and criminal damage to property. He argued that the armed robbery provision, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18-2(a)(2) (2000), and the home invasion provision, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-11(a)(4) (2000), he was convicted of violating were invalid under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, as imposing disproportionate penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant carried a gun when he and another invaded the victims' home, and one of the victims was badly injured when shots were fired during a struggle. The robbery and home invasion statutes under which he had been charged had been amended to provide a range of very severe penalties in cases where a firearm had been used. Certain subsections of each statute had already been found to violate the proportionate penalties clause, and the court found that the subsections under which defendant had been convicted were similarly defective because the resulting sentences were far more severe than those that could be imposed for crimes that necessarily included serious injury or death from a firearm. The definitions of the offenses were not severable from the disproportionate sentence enhancements, so reversal was required. The armed robbery conviction could be replaced with a conviction of simple robbery, but home invasion had no such lesser-included offenses, so that conviction and sentence were simply vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the armed robbery and home invasion convictions and vacated the sentences on those offenses. It affirmed the conviction of criminal damage to property. It ordered that the trial court enter a judgment convicting defendant of the lesser-included offense of robbery and remanded for sentencing for that offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff manufacturer and nominal defendant new auto dealership appealing a decision of defendant Illinois Motor Vehicle Review Board sustaining defendant existing dealerships' protests to the establishment of additional dealerships in their area as unsupported by good cause under 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 710/12 (2000) challenged the affirmance by the Sangamon Circuit Court (Illinois) of the administrative decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The existing dealerships protested the manufacturer's decision to add two more dealerships to their saturated areas. The court, reviewing the Review Board's findings with great deference, held that the determination that good cause, as defined at 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 710/2 (2000), did not exist for adding new dealerships was not against the manifest weight of the evidence and there were no clearly erroneous findings. It then considered the manufacturer's many constitutional challenges to the Motor Vehicle Franchise Act. &quot;Good cause&quot; was readily understandable enough to survive a vagueness challenge, and the proceedings themselves moved slowly only because of their complexity. The Act did not unduly burden interstate commerce, and it rationally related to a legitimate state concern with preventing manufacturers from unfairly using their great economic power to burden or destroy dealerships. A related challenge under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1-7, failed because the Franchise Act fell within the Sherman Act's state-action exemption. Although an award of attorney fees was allowed under the Act, the award was not yet reviewable because no amount had been specified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the administrative decision in all substantive respects, but vacated an award of attorney fees because that issue was not ripe for review. It remanded the matter to the Review Board for a determination of fees and costs to be awarded.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to an extended-term of six years' imprisonment for the Class 3 felony offense of aggravated battery and a concurrent term of six years imprisonment for the Class X felony offense of burglary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with residential burglary after he entered a home that was being remodeled and attempted to remove certain tools. He was chased from the home but returned with a 30 inch &quot;club,&quot; which he was swinging wildly when he hit the battery victim. Because the house was being remodeled, the trial court ruled that defendant was not guilty of residential burglary but was instead guilty of simple burglary. The court reversed the burglary conviction, holding that 1) the amendment to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/19-3(a) (2002), which made burglary a lesser included offense of residential burglary, went into effect after defendant was charged, was substantive in nature, and could not be applied retroactively; 2) as the trial court had specifically ruled that defendant was not guilty of residential burglary, double jeopardy precluded his retrial on that charge; 3) the trial court properly ruled that the club defendant used was a deadly weapon; 4) defendant's prior aggravated battery conviction made him eligible for the extended sentence he received for the instant aggravated battery conviction; and 5) 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (2000) was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which, following a bench trial, rejected defendant's insanity defense, found him guilty of murdering his girlfriend and his daughter, but also found him mentally ill, and which sentenced him to natural life without parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant did not challenge the murder findings. All appellate issues concerned his insanity defense. He argued that the insanity statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-2 (2000), violated the Due Process, Cruel and Unusual Punishment, and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Illinois constitutions. He also challenged findings that he was competent and that he did not prove insanity. The court found that the clear and convincing burden of proof for an insanity defense did not violate due process. The insanity statute did not make mental illness itself a crime, so there was no cruel and unusual punishment. A rational basis existed for treating insanity and intoxication defenses differently, so equal protection was satisfied. Despite evidence that defendant had delusional thoughts or recollections of the crime, evidence also showed that he was fully aware of the charges and the nature of the proceedings, and he was able to work with counsel on his defense, so he was competent to stand trial under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/104-16(b) (2000). Finally, the trial court properly weighed conflicting evidence to find defendant did not prove his insanity defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which convicted defendant of the drug-induced homicide and involuntary manslaughter of one woman and criminal sexual assault of another woman.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from a night of partying. Defendant contended on appeal that numerous errors occurred on the part of the trial court that entitled him to a new trial or a reversal of his convictions. He contended that the trial court erroneously declined to sever the criminal sexual assault count from the homicide counts, erroneously admitted evidence of other uncharged sex offenses that he committed before the night of the incident, erred in denying him the right to confront the criminal sexual assault victim and one of his codefendants about their motives to testify, and other assertions. The Stated addressed each of the issues raised by defendant and asserted that a remand was in order for the trial court to impose mandatory consecutive sentences. The court concluded that the trial court erred in denying the motion to sever the criminal sexual assault charge from the drug induced homicide and involuntary manslaughter charges, which error was compounded by the erroneous admission of evidence of defendant's other sex crimes and the corresponding jury instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted at a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of aggravated battery, under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-4(b)(1) (2000), and burglary, under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/19-3 ( 2000). Defendant was sentenced to an extended-term of six years' imprisonment for the felony offense of aggravated battery and a concurrent term of six years imprisonment for the felony offense of burglary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A homeowner was having his house remodeled while he was still living in the house. Construction workers at the site noticed defendant picking up the construction company's tools in the house. An altercation ensued in which defendant used a stick that was approximately 30 inches long and two inches thick to hit a construction worker in the head. None of the homeowner's property was missing after defendant's unauthorized entry. On appeal, the court found that (1) defendant's burglary conviction was improper because an amendment to the residential burglary statute, which included burglary as a lesser-included offense of residential burglary, was not effective until after defendant's conviction; (2) sufficient evidence existed to find defendant guilty of aggravated battery beyond a reasonable doubt predicated upon his use of a deadly weapon to commit a battery; (3) 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3(c)(8) (2000) was constitutional; and (4) the extended-term sentencing provision of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (2000), which allowed discretionary extended-term sentencing by the judge based on prior convictions, did not violate defendant's due process or jury trial guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) determined that defendant was a sexually dangerous person under &sect; 1.01 of the Illinois Sexually Dangerous Persons Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 205/1.01 (1996), the instant court vacated the judgment and remanded. The Supreme Court of Illinois denied the State's petition for leave to appeal but directed the instant court to vacate its opinion and reconsider its judgment in light of another case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was reconsidered in light of In re Detention of Varner, which involved the constitutionality of a civil commitment proceeding under the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/1 et seq. (1998). The trial court never made a lack-of-control determination as required by the U.S. Supreme Court in Crane or the Illinois Supreme Court in Masterson. The State claimed, however, that defendant's diagnosis of paraphilia met the &quot;serious difficulty&quot; requirement under Crane and maintained that defendant's diagnosis as a pedophile necessarily implied that he lacked volitional capacity such that he had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. The appeals court disagreed. Defendant's diagnosis as a pedophile did not necessarily imply that he lacked volitional capacity such that he had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. Consequently, the trial court's judgment had to be vacated and remanded with directions to determine whether defendant's mental condition caused him serious difficulty in controlling his criminal sexual behavior. The &quot;serious difficulty&quot; finding required by the State's petition was to be made by the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was vacated, and the cause was remanded for a new commitment hearing wherein the parties would have a full and fair opportunity to adduce evidence pertinent to the applicable standards announced. The court retained jurisdiction for the purpose of reviewing the trial court's determination following the commitment hearing, and defendant and the State were allowed to submit supplemental briefs addressing this issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, after a motion to dismiss attempted first-degree murder charges was denied, was convicted in a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of two counts of attempted first-degree murder, pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/8-4 (2000). The circuit court sentenced defendant to two concurrent six-year terms in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appeared to have planned his attack on the victim by discovering the victim's home, timing his arrival at the victim's home to when the victim left for work, and dressing to conceal his identity. After shooting the victim, defendant chased the victim down in his car apparently to finish the job. Defendant later lied to the police about the condition of his car after the attack. Defendant argued that the attempt statute was unconstitutional, and that he was under the influence of prescription antidepressant medication and involuntarily intoxicated when he committed the offenses. On appeal, the court found that, while the state supreme court had held that the attempt statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/8-4 (2000), as amended by 1991 Ill. Laws 404, &sect; 5, was unconstitutional as it violated the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, only the amendment to the statute was unconstitutional. Thus, the statute was properly applied as it existed before the amendment. Further, the evidence rebutted defendant's position that he was intoxicated under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-3 (2002), whether voluntarily or involuntarily, when he committed the offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), defendant was found guilty of first degree murder. The jury additionally found that during the commission of the offense, defendant personally discharged a firearm that proximately caused the victim's death. The trial court sentenced defendant to two concurrent 50-year prison terms for two counts of first degree murder. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court could not say that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to question potential jurors regarding the principles articulated in Zehr. Because of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, he could not show a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different had such questioning taken place. Although defendant waived the argument because he failed to raise an objection to the court's failure to inform potential jurors of the principles embodied in Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 431(b) at trial or in a posttrial motion, the jurors were substantially informed in accordance with Rule 431(a) prior to the commencement of trial, and defendant was not deprived of a fair trial. Defendant contended that the trial court's admonishment to the deadlocked jury improperly coerced a holdout juror, but the trial court's instruction to the jury was a modification and clarification of the Prim instruction and was a correct statement of the law. The appeals court agreed with defendant and the State that the two convictions for counts IX and X improperly violated the one-act, one-crime doctrine and that count IX, which required a more culpable mental state, should stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's murder conviction was affirmed under count IX and vacated under count X, and he was entitled to 911 days of credit against his sentence. The mittimus was corrected in accordance with the holding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois), found defendant guilty of home invasion, a violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-11(a)(3) (2002). Defendant's posttrial motion was denied and he was sentenced to an enhanced sentence under &sect; 12-11(c). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence to find him guilty of home invasion and that his 15-year sentence enhancement, mandated by &sect;&nbsp;12-11(c) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. Two eyewitnesses identified defendant as one of two men who invaded their home. One of witnesses was at an arm's length from defendant for at least 10 minutes. The fact that the eyewitnesses failed to describe defendant as having facial hair did not negate their identifications. Further, the jury had the right to believe the eyewitnesses testimony over that of defendant's alibi witnesses. As to the sentence enhancement, the court applied a cross-comparison analysis to determine if home invasion with a firearm was a less serious offense than aggravated battery with a firearm but was punished more severely. The court concluded that both offenses shared the same statutory purpose. As home invasion could cause emotional and psychological trauma greater than that caused by an aggravated battery with a firearm, the legislature had determined that home invasion with a firearm was a greater evil than aggravated battery with a firearm. Therefore, the sentence was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

Ann. 5/2-1008 (2004) special representative of original defendant deceased doctor and his incorporated practice, appealed and plaintiff patient cross-appealed from a judgment on jury verdict of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) awarding the patient millions of dollars on his malpractice claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient sued the doctor after an operation on his ear resulted in severe disability. The doctor died during the trial and rather than delay, the patient elected to have a special administrator appointed under &sect; 2-1008, and was awarded a large sum which was, however, under &sect; 2-1008(b), limited by the amount of the doctor's malpractice coverage. The court held that the evidence was ample to support the jury's findings both that the doctor was negligent in failing to abort an operation that was going wrong and that the negligence proximately caused the injuries. The evidence adduced at trial did not, however, adequately establish vicarious liability of the practice, because it was based solely on extrajudicial admissions in unverified pleadings. The patient argued that he should be allowed to pursue the doctor's estate, which had since been opened, for any deficiency after malpractice coverage had been exhausted, but the court held that the statute meant what it said, and that the plain meaning comported with legislative intent of allowing an expedited process as long as plaintiffs were willing to accept the limits the legislature had placed on the statutory right it had created.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial on the issue of negligence but reversed the order denying a new trial on the issue of the practice's liability under agency principles. It affirmed the trial court on matters of statutory interpretation raised in the cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

However, in the event that the board's doctors did not unanimously certify an applicant as disabled, whatever meritorious arguments the applicant might raise at a hearing would have no bearing on the outcome of his case because just one unfavorable certificate rendered the entire proceeding pointless. Accordingly, the &sect; 3-115 certification requirement, as it was currently drafted, was unconstitutional as applied to the officer and did not bar him from receiving a pension. As to the declaratory judgment action, even if the court were to agree with the officer that his due process rights were violated, it would not change the outcome.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment in the declaratory action was affirmed, but the circuit court's affirmance of the pension board's decision to deny the officer a pension was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the board for further proceedings because the board did not make a determination as to whether the officer was entitled to a &quot;line of duty&quot; pension or a &quot;not on duty&quot; pension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a class action complaint against defendants, the Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois and the Justices of the Supreme Court of Illinois, alleging that Ill. Sup. Ct. R. Prof. Conduct 1.15, which established a program to provide for interest on lawyers' trust accounts (IOLTA), violated the Fifth Amendment. The Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois) granted defendants' motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, plaintiffs raised numerous issues. In Brown, the United States Supreme Court found that Washington's IOLTA rule resulted in a per se taking of private property for public use. However, because &quot;just compensation&quot; was measured by the property owner's loss, rather than the government's gain, and because if the Washington rule was followed, only funds that could not generate net interest for the client were to be placed in IOLTA accounts, the amount of compensation due was zero. The appellate court found no meaningful difference in the language of the Washington rule and the language of the Illinois rule. Accordingly, it found the holding of the United States Supreme Court in Brown to be apposite. The just compensation due a client under the terms of the Illinois rule was zero. Therefore, there had been no violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the trial court was not in error when it dismissed plaintiffs' complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Temporary custody of the child had initially been granted to the father. Custody was transferred to the mother pursuant to a motion filed by the child's representative. The motion indicated that the father was failing to cooperate in necessary providing the child with necessary therapeutic services. The court granted leave to appeal but affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that 1) the proper method for bringing an interlocutory appeal of a custody order was to follow the procedures in Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 306(a)(5), (b); 2) once leave to appeal was granted, the procedures set forth in Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 306A were to be followed to ensure expedient review of child custody cases; 3) the father's notice of appeal was sufficient to provide notice of an interlocutory appeal; 4) 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/506(a)(3) endowed a child's representative with the authority to file motions for changes in temporary custody; and 5) as the father never requested an evidentiary hearing on the motion filed by the child's representative, 750 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois), which convicted him on a jury verdict of guilty to first degree murder in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(a)(1), (a)(2) (2002), and which sentenced him to 65 years' imprisonment after including a 25 year sentence enhancement under &sect; 5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(iii) of the Unified Code of Corrections, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(iii) (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed the victim. The 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(iii) 25 year sentence enhancement was imposed for defendant's use of a firearm. On appeal, defendant challenged only the enhancement. He argued it did not apply to him because &sect; 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(iii) required the firearm be discharged at a person other than the victim. He challenged &sect; 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(iii) under the due process clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, under the proportionate penalties clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and as an impermissible double enhancement. The plain language of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(iii) applied the enhancement when a firearm harmed anyone other than defendant, including the victim. The enhancement was consistent with, and furthered, the legislative goal of deterring gun violence, so it satisfied due process. A comparative proportionality review was inappropriate since the enhancement deterred gun violence in addition to murder, and defendant had no other proportionality argument. Since the firearm, and not the victim's death, triggered &sect; 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(iii), there was no double enhancement to the existing enhancement for a first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's murder conviction and the 65 year sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was the biological father of the minor's half-sister. The minor had resided with petitioner and his sister for two years prior to the filing of the petition. Neither his biological mother or father were capable of or wanted to care for the minor. It was clear that the minor had benefitted from living with petitioner and he wanted petitioner as his guardian. The probate court agreed that appointment of petitioner as the guardian was in the minor's best interest. However, the petition was denied under 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-3(a) (2004) due to petitioner's felony conviction 10 years earlier. The court reversed. Courts in Illinois had the inherent authority under the common law to appoint guardians where doing so was in the best interests of a minor. Strict application of &sect;&nbsp;11-3(a) was not required where such application would lead to unjust consequences by forcing a probate court to ignore its own conclusion and subordinate a minor's interest to the generic criteria contained in &sect;&nbsp;11-3(a). As the probate court had done just that, its decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of attempted armed robbery, attempted aggravated robbery, and aggravated battery for accosting a man and his wife one night.

He also contended that his conviction for attempted aggravated robbery had to be vacated since it arose from the same act as the attempted armed robbery. He further asserted that his extended-term sentences for attempted aggravated robbery and aggravated battery were improper. Too, he claimed a lack of proper admonishment under Ill. S. Ct. R. 605(a) regarding his appeal rights. Finally, he contended that compulsory extraction of his DNA, as required by statute, violated his constitutional search and seizure rights. The appellate court agreed that the attempted aggravated robbery conviction had to be vacated, but otherwise affirmed, especially since it found his ineffective assistance claim to be insufficient, a lack of prejudice as to other issues, and that the statute authorizing the taking of his DNA was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The police pension board also denied his motion requesting a hearing into the alleged biases of two police pension board trustees. On administrative review, the trial court affirmed the police pension board's decision upon finding that the police pension board's ruling was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling. It found that there was no question that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the police pension board's finding that the claimant was not disabled, as such evidence was indicated in the report and evidence deposition of one of the three physicians selected by the police pension board to determine whether he was disabled. It also found that the Illinois Pension Code did not mandate or permit a hearing on his claim that two police pension board trustees were biased against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, four children of a decedent, appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed their legal malpractice action against defendant attorney because the complaint was filed after the repose period set forth in 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-214.3 (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney filed a medical malpractice action on behalf of the decedent's estate in 1986. He purposely failed to file an affidavit from a healthcare provider because the wanted to test the constitutionality of 735 Ill. Stat. Ann. 5/2-622 (2000). As expected the case was dismissed. The constitutionality of &sect; 2-622 was ultimately upheld by the Illinois Supreme Court. The attorney's attempt at refiling a complaint on behalf of the children in 1996 was unsuccessful. The children filed their legal malpractice suit in 2000. The court reversed, holding that 1) the statute of repose applied to bar the instant action unless it had been tolled; 2) 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-214.3(e) (2000) did not toll the statute of repose; 3) the children's fourth amended complaint sufficiently pled fraudulent concealment by the attorney, as their fiduciary, of the cause of action against him, which tolled the statute of repose; and 4) the allegations in the fourth amended complaint adequately established a reasonable reliance by the children on the attorney's representations about the status of their case such that the attorney was equitably estopped from raising the statute of repose as a defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois) following a partially negotiated guilty plea. Under the plea, defendant was convicted of four counts of reckless homicide, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3(a), (c)(1), (e-5) (2002) and was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 10 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed, challenging the propriety of his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed four people in a vehicle accident. When he was charged, &sect; 9-3(e-5) elevated the offense to a Class 2 felony if two or more people were killed. Prior to sentencing, that portion of &sect; 9-3 was removed from the statute. Similar language was added to the aggravated driving under the influence (DUI) statute,&nbsp;625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-501 (2002). Defendant argued that he should have been told he could be sentenced to a Class 3 felony under amended &sect; 9-3. The court affirmed, holding that 1) defendant was actually attacking his plea agreement, in which he agreed to be sentenced for a Class 2 felony, and his failure to file a motion to withdraw his plea was fatal to his appeal; 2) defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to advise defendant he could be sentenced under either the old or new version of the reckless homicide statute as he continued to be subject to a Class 2 felony under the amended DUI statute; 3) the sentence was not based on improper aggravation; 4) Apprendi did not apply to the sentence; and 5) the trial court properly ruled that the sentence was subject to the truth-in-sentencing provisions of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-1-1 et seq. (2002).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retired police officer appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) that, after remand, adhered to its original finding that defendant police pension board had properly interpreted 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-114.1 and 3-115 (2002) in denying him line-of-duty disability benefits because of his failure to present certifications from three physicians as to his disability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer had pre-existing problems, but there was little doubt that his career-ending injury occurred in the line of duty. Two of the three physicians he consulted certified him as disabled in the line of duty. The third physician did not certify him as disabled at all. After instruction by the state's highest court, the trial court and the instant court considered whether the dissident physician's opinion was against the manifest weight of the evidence. They decided that it was. All the same, this did not change the result. Section 3-115 clearly required certifications from three physicians. There was nothing that stopped the officer from obtaining permission to seek a fourth opinion, and there was every likelihood that the fourth opinion would have found him disabled. But in the absence of three certifications, there was nothing a court could do to help. The legislative mandate was clear.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty in the Circuit Court of Livingston County (Illinois), to a charge of child pornography, violating 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-20.1(a)(1)(vii) (2002)). He was sentenced to four years in prison. Defendant appealed, arguing that, as applied to him, the mandatory minimum four-year sentence for child pornography was unconstitutional because it violated the proportionate-penalties clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with child pornography after he photographed his 13-year-old stepdaughter in a pose involving a lewd exhibition of her unclothed genitals and buttocks. On appeal, defendant contended that (1) his four-year prison sentence was &quot;wholly disproportionate&quot; to the offense he committed and (2) the offense of child pornography violated the proportionate-penalties clause when compared to the similar offense of sexual exploitation of a child, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-9.1(a-5) (2002). The court disagreed. The victim had suffered serious psychological injuries even though she suffered no physical injury, and the fact that defendant committed the offense against a member of his family made his actions even more serious. Considering the ongoing psychological issues that were affecting the victim, the court concluded that the statutorily mandated statute was not grossly disproportional to an offense that shocked the moral sense of the community. Further, as child pornography contained an element not found in the sexual exploitation statute, photographing the victim, the two statutes did not have identical elements and different sentences could be imposed.</SPAN></P>

Both subsections denied a parent any right of rebuttal of the presumption of unfitness, while a finding of unfitness under &sect; 1(D)(i)(2), which dealt with convictions for first or second degree murder, was rebuttable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff clinical social worker sought administrative review to reverse an Illinois Department of Professional Regulation decision that suspended his license 60 days and placed him on probation based on the Department's determination that he exhibited professional incompetence and committed malpractice. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied administrative review and affirmed the Department's decision. The social worker appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Director of the Department determined that the social worker violated 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 20/19(1)(e) and (f) of the Clinical Social Work and Social Work Practice Act by encouraging a client's adolescent sexual activity with other minors, instructing the client on sexual technique, and failing to report the client's sexual activity. On appeal, the social worker claimed that the Department's determination was clearly erroneous. The appeals court found that under the holding in In re T.W. and the definition of &quot;abused child&quot; in 325 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, 325 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1 et seq. (1998), the clinical social worker's client and the other minors with whom the client engaged in consensual sex could all be considered to be abused children. This fact could then trigger the requirements of the Reporting Act, compelling the social worker to report the client's sexual activity to the Department. Contrary to the social worker's claim, nothing in the Practice Act required that the charge against him specifically allege that he was mentally or physically impaired before he could be required to submit to an examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision upholding the Department's finding that the social worker violated the Practice Act was reversed. The matter was remanded to determine whether the client or other minors were to be considered an &quot;abused children&quot; under the Reporting Act and, if so, whether the social worker was required to report the client's sexual activities. The Department was to consider whether the parties should be allowed to present new evidentiary matters.</SPAN></P>

Ordinance M-28-2001, an ordinance passed by defendant village which granted defendant historical society a special use permit and a zoning variation. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered an order and memorandum opinion granting defendants' motions for summary judgment, denying plaintiffs' cross-motions, and entering judgment for defendants. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that after amending the zoning ordinance to define &quot;nonessential public use&quot; (Winnetka, Ill., Mun.

The appeals court found the village council was granted the authority to determine what constituted a &quot;nonessential public use.&quot; No additional evidentiary hearing was required. Moreover, there was a sufficient factual basis that the historical society was a nonessential public use affected with the public interest. There was evidence that the special use would not substantially diminish neighborhood property values, that traffic congestion would be minimized, and that adequate parking would be provided. Plaintiffs failed to show a conflict of interest on the part of a trustee, failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of validity that attached to the village's legislative act granting the zoning variation and enacting the ordinance, and failed to show that the village's use of Illinois Municipal Code, 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-1-1 et seq. (2002), language to define a special use exceeded the village's authority or that such definition was unduly vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant admitted to charges of burglary, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and criminal sexual assault. He was committed to the Illinois Department of Human Services. Appellant did not challenge the commitment.

No per se conflict existed in such an arrangement, and appellant failed to argue or show that any actual conflict existed between his wishes and the GAL's judgment regarding appellant's best interests. While independent counsel might be needed in some cases, appellant failed to establish that separate counsel was required in his case.</SPAN></P>

The case was dismissed for want of prosecution (DWP) when the patient, who was acting pro se at the time, failed to appear at a status conference. The patient then filed the 735 Ill. Comp. Stat.

As he had never filed the required affidavit and health professional report, he had not established a meritorious medical malpractice claim. Thus, the trial court's grant of &sect; 2-1401 relief was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

After defendant was convicted, he was ordered to submit a DNA sample pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2002). Defendant argued the stipulation violated his right to confrontation and that &sect; 5-4-3 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. Defense counsel could waive defendant's right to confrontation so long as defendant did not object and the waiver was part of sound trial strategy. Defendant had not voiced an objection, and trial counsel's decision to enter into the stipulation in order to concentrate on other aspects of the case was a sound decision. The purpose of &sect; 5-4-3 was to create a database of recidivist criminal offenders, and it had been repeatedly upheld as constitutional under the balancing test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) convicting him on jury verdict of home invasion in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-11(a)(2) (2002), aggravated battery in violation in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-4(b) (2002), and domestic battery in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-3.2(a)(1) (2002) and imposing extended sentences for the latter two offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose out of defendant's invasion of a former girlfriend's home and his administration of a savage beating upon her. The court held, first, that since aggravated battery, involving a deadly weapon, and domestic battery, which required a prior conviction as charged as well as a victim who was a household member, were distinct offenses, conviction on all three charges did not violate the one-act, one-crime rule. It was improper, however, for the trial court to have enhanced the sentences for the battery offenses since they were part of the same series of acts as the most serious offense, the home invasion. The domestic battery statute was not unconstitutionally vague in adopting a definition of &quot;family or household member&quot; that included persons whom a defendant had formerly dated because the definition was readily understandable without any time limit. Defendant's post-verdict, pre-sentence letter to the trial judge was sufficient to establish a pro se motion for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel, so that motion should not have been denied without a preliminary investigation into the claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, modified the judgment to allow credit for defendant's presentence confinement, remanded with directions to issue a written amendment of judgment to that effect, vacated the extended term sentences for aggravated battery and domestic battery and reduced those sentences to the maximum non-extended terms, and directed the trial court after remand to investigate defendant's counsel ineffectiveness claims.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment, holding that 1) the only competent evidence concerning the custody of the 1987 will came from the decedent's secretary, who stated it was last seen in the decedent's possession; 2) as the original could not be found, the presumption was that the decedent had destroyed the 1987 will; 3) testimony from the nephew about what transpired at a photocopier after the secretary last saw the will was barred by the Dead Man's Act, 735 Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of the 14th Judicial Circuit, Whiteside County, Illinois, which found him to be an unfit parent and terminated his parental rights. The father argued that the trial court erred when it found him unfit pursuant to &sect; 1(D)(q) of the Adoption Act, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(q) (2002), because that provision was violative of equal protection and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to terminate the father's parental rights to three children. The State alleged, inter alia, that he had been convicted of aggravated battery of a child. The State moved for summary judgment, alleging that the father's aggravated battery conviction rendered him an unfit parent as a matter of law pursuant to 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(q) (2002). The trial court granted the motion. The Illinois Supreme Court had determined that there was no rational basis for treating persons subject to fitness proceedings under &sect; 1(D)(q) differently from those facing the same proceedings under &sect; 1(D)(i). Accordingly, it held that &sect; 1(D)(q) was unconstitutional as violative of equal protection. The court also held that the proper remedy for that constitutional violation was to extend the opportunity to rebut to persons subject to &sect; 1(D)(q) proceedings. The appellate court held that since the trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment without affording the father the opportunity to rebut the presumption of unfitness arising from his aggravated battery of a child conviction, he was denied equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs argued the ordinance violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court affirmed, holding that 1) as the ordinance did not give the County &quot;unbridled discretion&quot; to grant or deny license applications, the ordinance did not constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech; 2) as the ordinance did not ban all adult establishments, it was properly analyzed as a time, place, or manner restriction; 3) in enacting the ordinance, the County relied on both studies of the effects of adult establishments conducted elsewhere and information received from law enforcement representatives, and therefore, the ordinance was content-neutral; 4) the evidence at trial showed that the ordinance served a substantial government interest and also showed a nexus between the ordinance and the harm it sought to alleviate; and 5) plaintiffs argument regarding the age restriction in the ordinance was waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the holder of an Illinois license, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which upheld an order of defendant Illinois Secretary of State that suspended plaintiff's driver's license pursuant to recommendations and findings issued by defendant hearing officer. Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-206(a)(10) (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's license was suspended after he was arrested for public intoxication in Iowa and was found to be in possession of his older brother's Illinois identification card. The older brother was above the legal drinking age, but plaintiff was not. Plaintiff alleged that &sect; 6-206(a)(10) violated his right to due process and that his simple possession of the card created an unconstitutional presumption that he intended to use the identification card for purposes of obtaining alcohol. The court affirmed holding that &sect; 6-206(a)(10): (1) did not violate due process because it was rationally related to the State's interest in fostering safe and legal operation of motor vehicles; (2) was not unconstitutional on its face and was not applied unconstitutionally to plaintiff; and (3) did not violate Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970). Further, the hearing officer's decision in the case was not against the manifest weight of the evidence where the evidence established that plaintiff was not of legal drinking age, he was intoxicated when arrested, he was in possession of the identification card during a time he was illegally consuming alcohol, and he held a valid Illinois driver's license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicting him of violating the Illinois Harmful Materials statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-21 (2002). He argued that the statute was unconstitutional and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was employed at a residential treatment center for teen-aged boys. He brought a purported sports video into the center that turned out to show defendant engaged in sex acts with various women. One of the women shouted out a greeting to the boys at the center in one of the episodes. Except for a few seconds the first time one boy viewed the tape, the evidence indicated that the boys viewed the tape, which defendant had not removed, when defendant was not present. The court held, first, that there was no First Amendment violation, in part because the usual standards for determining whether material was obscene did not apply in the case of reasonable exercises of the police power to protect minors. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague either, since the phrases it used, such as &quot;prurient interest,&quot; had already been approved as sufficiently precise in decisions of the highest courts in both Illinois and the nation. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to support conviction even though defendant had not been present for most of the viewings since he knew he had brought the video to the center, did not remove it, and had one of the participants greet the boy viewers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed in part and reversed in part; cause remanded with directions.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Vermilion County (Illinois) found defendant guilty of possession of a substance containing cocaine and sentenced him to probation with various terms and conditions. One condition was that he submit to genetic testing pursuant to &sect; 5-4-3(a)(3.5) of the Unified Code of Corrections, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3(a)(3.5) (2002) (as amended by 2001 Ill. Laws 829), at his own expense and pay a $ 200 analysis fee. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the compulsory extraction and storing of his deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) violated the Sixth Amendment and that the trial court lacked authority to order him to pay the cost of DNA collection in addition to the analysis fee. The appeals court found that as a convicted felon sentenced to probation, defendant had a diminished expectation of privacy and agreed with courts that applied the balancing test when reviewing the constitutionality of &sect; 5-4-3(a)(3.5). Collection and cataloguing of DNA assisted the State in identifying repeat offenders who could conceal or alter their identity and could assist the State in solving past and future crimes. Thus, the State had a compelling interest in genetic-marker collection of felons. Because the State's interest outweighed a convicted felon's diminished privacy rights and due to the fact that DNA sampling was only minimally intrusive, &sect; 5-4-3(a)(3.5) did not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, until the statute was amended, trial courts were limited to imposing the $ 200 analysis fee under &sect; 5-4-3(j) of the Unified Code (730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3(j) (2002)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The requirement that defendant submit to genetic testing was found constitutional. However, the trial court lacked the authority to order defendant to pay the cost of DNA collection. The case was remanded with directions to modify the order of probation to vacate the condition that defendant pay the cost of DNA collection.</SPAN></P>

DiMarzio, Judge, Presiding.  <BR>People v. Traynoff (In re Traynoff), 338 Ill. App. 3d 949, 789 N.E.2d 865, 2003 Ill. App. LEXIS 574, 273 Ill. Dec. 691 (Ill. App. Ct., 2003)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that sufficient evidence existed that respondent was a sexually violent person. After the court remanded the case to the trial court with directions to conduct a Frye hearing to determine the admissibility of the actuarial instruments used to measure the likelihood of reoffense, the Supreme Court of Illinois directed the court to vacate its opinion and reconsider its judgment in light of its decision in In re Commitment of Simons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on expert testimony, the trial court concluded that respondent suffered from mental disorders that made it substantially probable that he would engage in acts of sexual violence. The court went beyond what Varner had interpreted Crane to require. Thus, there was no due process violation, and respondent's constitutional challenge to the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/1 et seq. (1998), failed. All three experts agreed that respondent suffered from paraphilia not otherwise specified and posed a moderate to high risk to reoffend. This testimony, in conjunction with respondent's refusal to undergo treatment, his denial of self-blame, and his placing blame on the victim, established that he lacked the ability to control his sexually violent behavior. Compelling him to submit to an evaluation did not violate his 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/25(c)(2) (1998) right to remain silent. In light of Simons, holding that actuarial risk assessment had gained general acceptance in the psychological and psychiatric communities and was therefore admissible, the trial court properly admitted the expert testimony of two psychologists.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found him guilty of 12 counts of predatory criminal sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and aggravated criminal sexual abuse, with the lesser offenses merging into the greater, as well as counts of sexual exploitation of a child and unlawful restraint, and sentenced him to natural life in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10 (2002), which allowed for the introduction of the victim's statements to third persons at his trial, was unconstitutional on its face and that the wrongfully admitted statements resulted in his conviction. The appellate court concluded that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10(b)(1) and (b)(2)(A) interacted to specifically provide that a victim's hearsay statements should be admitted only when there were sufficient safeguards of reliability surrounding the statements and the victim actually testified at trial. Thus, in requiring the appearance of the victim at trial, the statutory procedure was wholly consistent with the holding of Crawford and, in and of itself, suffered no constitutional impediment. The appellate court found 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10(b)(2)(A) to be severable from any other allegedly unconstitutional provisions in 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10. In addition, defendant's confession corroborated the victim's account of the sexual abuse, and these sources of evidence alone provided overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/18-4(a)(4). The first trial ended in a mistrial and defendant objected. Defendant was retried and convicted. Defendant appealed first contending that the second trial violated his double jeopardy rights under the United States and Illinois Constitutions. The court noted that where a mistrial was declared over defendant's objection, retrial was permitted where there was a manifest necessity for declaring the mistrial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding a manifest necessity for a mistrial because the jury could not collectively agree, they deliberated for a sufficient period of time, the trial was sufficiently long, the issues presented to the jury were not complex, the judge properly communicated with the jury, and further deliberations would have been exhausting and coercive in nature. Therefore, retrial did not offend defendant's double jeopardy rights. Defendant also argued that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/18-4(a)(4) was unconstitutional. The court held, however, that the crime charged did not exist at the time of defendant's trial, thus reversal of the conviction was mandated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was improperly convicted of two counts of threatening a public official because the police officer and dispatcher did not hold positions created by statute as required under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-9(b)(1) (2002). A statute creating the office had to expressly create the office. A statute or ordinance creating a department or department head was insufficient to create a subordinate office. The record did not reflect any statute or ordinance that expressly created the offices of the municipal police officer, the county dispatcher, or the county correctional officer. While 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/10-2.1-4 (2002) provided for the appointment of municipal police officer by a board of police commissioners, the statute did not expressly create the office of the municipal police officer for the municipality at issue. Likewise, none of the statutes cited by the State created the offices of dispatcher and correctional officer for the county at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state commerce commission entered a decision that canceled the telephone company's wireless termination tariff on the grounds that the telephone company failed to give proper, actual notice of the tariff to affected customers known as commercial mobile radio service telecommunications (CMRS) carriers. On appeal, the telephone company claimed that the CMRS carriers were not customers entitled to individual notice of its proposed tariff. It also argued that the Illinois Administrative Code and state statutory law, which allowed out-of-state attorneys to petition to appear pro hac vice in state commerce commission proceedings, impermissibly encroached on the powers of the state judiciary. The appellate court rejected both claims. It found that since the tariff would change the rates for the CMRS carriers, actual notice was required pursuant to Ill. Admin. Code tit. 83, &sect; 745.110(c)(1). It also found that neither the Illinois Administrative Code provision nor the state statutory provision allowing out-of-state attorneys to appear before the state commerce commission were unconstitutional, as the state commerce commission had the discretionary authority to permit them to appear.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which found defendant a sexually violent person pursuant to the provisions of the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act (the Act), 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/1 et seq. (2000). Defendant had pled guilty to the charge of aggravated criminal sexual assault in 1992 and was sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five days before his scheduled mandatory supervised release, the State filed a petition to commit defendant pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. &sect; 207/40 (2000) of the Act. The petition alleged that defendant was suffering from paraphilia, alcohol dependence, and severe antisocial personality disorder. The State alleged that defendant was dangerous to others because his mental disorders created a substantial probability that he would engage in future acts of sexual violence. The court found no merit in defendant's constitutional challenge to the Act because prior caselaw had already resolved that issue. Further, the court found no error with regard to the admission of expert testimony presented by the State regarding the results of certain actuarial instruments utilized to predict the likelihood that defendant would reoffend. The court held that expert testimony predicated upon actuarial risk assessment instruments was admissible in cases seeking commitment under the provisions of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Authority owned, operated, and maintained a general aviation airport and owned property leased to various tenants, including private, for-profit, commercial entities.

Ann. 200/15-160 (2000), as fulfilling an &quot;Airport Authority purpose.&quot; The trial court concluded that an amendment to the Airport Authorities Act (Act), 70 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1 et seq. (2000), changed the definition of &quot;Airport Authority purpose.&quot; However, the appeals court, in considering the Code, did not believe that a Code amendment evinced a clear intent on the legislature's part to overrule the holding of Harrisburg-Raleigh Airport Authority that private leases that fulfilled an airport purpose could be exempt under the Code. After considering the language of the Code and the Act (as amended), the appeals court concluded that the legislature did not intend to change the definition of &quot;Airport Authority purposes&quot; from that articulated in Harrisburg. It was clear that the disputed property did not meet the standard for &quot;Airport Authority purposes&quot; under the Code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the denial of his motion to quash his arrest and suppress evidence, defendant stipulated to a bench trial. The Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) found defendant guilty of driving under the influence (DUI), 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-501(a)(2) (2000) and operating an uninsured vehicle, 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-707 (2000), imposed concurrent terms of conditional discharge, and fined defendant a total of $ 1,250.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was illegally seized. Defendant argues that the officer's activation of her squad car's lights removed her actions from the realm of her community caretaking function, thereby requiring a reasonable suspicion in order to justify her stop of defendant. The appellate court noted that there was nothing in the record to suggest that the officer's stop of defendant's vehicle was justified on any basis other than reasonable suspicion. The officer did not testify that she observed the car drive off rapidly or recklessly, but merely that it began to pull up, whereupon she activated her lights and stopped it. The officer indicated that the mere presence of the car in the parking lot after hours led her to suspect criminal activity. The appellate court held that, under the circumstances, the officer lacked a reasonable and articulable basis to justify her decision to perform a Terry stop. Thus, the trial court should have granted defendant's motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence. The appellate court further concluded that the State would have been unable to prove defendant's guilty without the fruits of the stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate entered a negotiated guilty plea to attempted first degree murder of a peace officer after his juvenile case was transferred to adult court. Subsequently, 1994 Ill. Laws 680, which added the transfer statute, 705 Ill. Stat. Ann. 405/5-4 (3.3) (1996), and amended the sentencing statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/8-4 (1996), was held unconstitutional. The circuit court dismissed the petition, finding that the inmate's sentence was appropriate even though the sentencing statute had been held to be void. The circuit court did not address the inmate's claims that he had a right to a new transfer hearing and trial. The inmate argued that as the transfer and sentencing statutes were void, so were his transfer hearing, his plea, and his sentence. The court agreed. Because 1994 Ill. Laws 680 had been ruled unconstitutional, the judgment had to be voided, and the case remanded to the juvenile court. On remand, the presumptive transfer provisions of 1997 Ill. Laws 590, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/5-805(2)(b) (2002), would be applied. Application of the statute to the inmate's case would not violate the ex post facto clauses in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect;10 and Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the daughter's disability benefits were exempt under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 407(a) from the claims of the daughter's creditors and, therefore, could not be used to pay her attorney or guardian ad litem (GAL). The mother also argued that the parties could not stipulate that the daughter was disabled or to the trial court's authority to award visitation. The court disagreed. While &sect; 407(a) protected the disability payments from attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, it did not extend to situations in which the person receiving the benefits voluntarily agreed to the payments. All of the parties, including the GAL, the mother as guardian of the daughter's person, and the father as guardian of the daughter's estate, had agreed to the payments. Further, the appointment of the GAL and the daughter's attorney had been in her best interests. The parties' stipulations regarding the daughter's disability and visitation were in the nature of a consent decree. They could not be amended or varied without the consent of all of the parties unless they were contrary to public policy.

The mother testified that she was willing to make the daughter available for visitation anytime the daughter wished to visit with the father but that she did not want to force the daughter to do so. The trial court found that the mother's denial of visitation was wilful and without cause or provocation. The court held that the order of visitation was void because the daughter was 24 years old at the time and the trial court had no jurisdiction over a child who had reached the age of majority. In turn, the mother could not have been held in contempt for violating a void order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), defendant was convicted of possession with intent to deliver cocaine and heroin and sentenced to concurrent prison terms of seven and four years. He appealed from both his convictions and sentences, contending, among other things, that the State's evidence was insufficient to support his convictions and that the trial court relied on improper evidence in finding him guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court heard unchallenged testimony of an officer and a forensic scientist as to the chain of custody. Defendant stipulated to that testimony and, by consenting to its admission, could not object to its admission for the first time on appeal. The forensic scientist's stipulated testimony did not lack an adequate foundation. The evidence was sufficient to support his conviction as defendant was observed retrieving a small object from a bag and handing it to another individual in exchange for cash. A bag containing individual packets of cocaine and cash were found on his person, and he was observed dropping another bag containing 25 individual packets of a suspected controlled substance. It was not unreasonable for the trial court to infer that defendant intended to deliver the narcotics found in his possession, and the evidence adequately supported such an inference. However, because there was no indication from the record that the parties agreed to a specific sentence, the State and defendant were without authority to waive the written presentence investigation report requirement, and the trial court was without authority to accept their purported waiver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court as to defendant's convictions was affirmed, but his sentences were vacated and remanded for a new sentencing hearing in accordance with the appeals court's instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was sentenced to 80 years in prison after he was found guilty by a jury of first-degree murder. His direct appeal was then denied. Several years later, he filed a postconviction petition for relief and alleged that the sentence in his case violated the recent Apprendi decision. The trial court allowed the petition to proceed to the second stage of review. It then summarily dismissed the petition on the ground that retroactive application of Apprendi was barred where direct appeals had been exhausted as of the date of the Apprendi decision. Petitioner then appealed and claimed that the trial court's summary dismissal violated his rights under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-2.1(a) (2002). He also argued that his postconviction attorney had not complied with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c) regarding consultation with petitioner. The appellate court found that even if those provisions were violated, the violations amounted to no more than harmless error because petitioner could not show prejudice due to the fact that in any event, his Apprendi claim was barred due to the fact that he had exhausted his appeals before Apprendi had been decided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicting him of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon (UUW) in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6 (2002) and sentencing him to 14 years in prison. He argued that the aggravated UUW statute violated substantive due process and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and that his sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated UUW after being found with a loaded weapon by police investigating citizen reports of a person pointing a weapon at cars. Adhering to previously decided case law, the court found no due process violation in the aggravated UUW statute because it provided for a level of scienter--knowing action--and the enhanced penalties it allowed bore a rational relationship to the evils the statute sought to prevent. Although the statute criminalizing reckless discharge of a firearm provided for far less severe penalties, there was no violation of the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, because the two statutes had very different purposes as well as distinct levels of required scienter. Defendant also argued that the trial court had abused its discretion in giving his failure to show up at his sentencing hearing undue weight in imposing sentence. The court did not have to resolve that issue because it found that defendant's prior felony history, which had also been considered, more than justified an enhanced sentence under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3.2 (2002).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful manufacture of more than 900 grams of a substance containing methamphetamine, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 570/401(a)(6.5)(D) (2000), and unlawful possession of more than 30 grams of cannabis with intent to deliver, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 550/5(d) (2000). The Circuit Court of Marion County (Illinois) sentenced him to 15 years for manufacturing and 5 years for possession, to run concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to defendant's arguments as to the validity of the search warrant, the appellate court found that there was sufficient probable cause to support issuance of the warrant based on the informant's testimony that he tried to buy drugs from another person and saw that person making methamphetamine. While the affidavit and warrant did not list the specific postal address of the premises, the search was executed at the correct location. Thus, the warrant sufficiently described the place to be searched. The appellate court further concluded that the items listed in the warrant were easily identified by a trained officer as contraband and thus, the descriptions were sufficient to satisfy the particularity requirement. Defendant's ineffective assistance claim failed due to the fact that the warrant was of sufficient particularity such that any failure to challenge the warrant would have been futile. Finally, the appellate court concluded that a reasonable inference of intent to deliver was derived from the fact that the police discovered more than 30 grams of marijuana, money in a locked box, scales, a walkie-talkie, two hand-held police scanners, and drug paraphernalia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife, individually and as special administrator of the estate of her late husband, appealed the Circuit Court of Cook County's (Illinois) grant of summary judgment to appellee insurer in its declaratory judgment action where it sought a declaration of no coverage as to the wife's underinsured motorist claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife and the husband were passengers involved in a car accident. The driver was insured through the insurer. The insurer attempted to prorate the $ 300,000 per accident bodily injury maximum between six accident victims. The wife, however, also sought to recover $ 28,500 each under the driver's underinsured motorist coverage, so that she and her husband's estate would each receive the $ 100,000-per-person limit provided for bodily injuries. The insurer contended that underinsured motorist coverage was unavailable as the driver's car was not an underinsured vehicle as defined in a policy exclusion. The appeals court agreed with decisions from other jurisdictions that allowing a person to receive benefits under both the liability and underinsured motorist provisions of a single policy would amount to an impermissible rewriting of the policy to increase the liability coverage. Since liability and underinsured motorist limits were coextensive in an insured's policy under the scheme envisioned by 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/143a-2(4) (2000), a situation would not arise where that insured's vehicle would be underinsured as to itself. Legislative intent also supported this conclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence enhancement was based on defendant's use of a firearm in committing the murder.

Defendant also argued that the enhancement constituted improper double enhancement and that it violated the proportionality clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970). The court disagreed on all points, holding that 1) as used in the enhancement statute, causing the death &quot;of another&quot; referred to a person other than defendant, not other than the victim of the crime; 2) the 25-year enhancement did not constitute a double enhancement because it was based not on the victim's death itself, which was the basis for the murder conviction, but on the use of a firearm to cause the death; 3) the enhancement statute did not violate the proportionality clause because the statute had the legitimate statutory purpose of deterring the use of firearms in the commission of murder, which the legislature had deemed to be a threat to the public's health, safety, and general welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 12.5 required the Illinois EPA to collect fees from certain NPDES permit holders, including plaintiffs. The court affirmed dismissal of the complaint, holding that 1) &sect; 12.5 did not violate the uniformity clause, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1970) where defendants submitted a legally sufficient justification for imposing fees on aggregate mines holding NPDES permits, imposing a fee on school districts holding such permits would not advance the objective of increasing state revenues, and the imposition of fees only on point sources of pollution was reasonably related to that legislative purpose; 2) as the uniformity clause was not violated, there was no violation of either the equal protection clause or the substantive due process clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970); 3) 2003 Ill. Laws 32 (eff. June 20, 2003) did not violate either the appropriations clause or the single-subject clause in Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d); 4) the federal Clean Water Act did not preempt state laws regarding NPDES permit programs; 5) there was no violation of the regulations promulgated under the Clean Water Act; and 6) the trial court properly refused to allow plaintiffs to amend their complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 9th Judicial Circuit Court, Knox County (Illinois), entered final judgments of conviction after it found defendant guilty on three counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. The trial court then sentenced defendant to a 60-day term of incarceration, a fine, and a 30-month term of probation. Defendant appealed his judgments of conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated criminal sexual abuse pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-16(d) (2002). The counts alleged that when defendant was at least five years older than the alleged victim, who was 13 years of age but under 17 years of age, he had sexual intercourse with her. Police learned that the victim and defendant regularly communicated by e-mail; eventually, defendant came to her house to meet her. The DNA profile on her underwear matched defendant's DNA profile. He admitted in an e-mail that he had a sexual relationship with her. At trial, the e-mails were authenticated and then admitted into evidence. Defendant was found guilty regarding three of the counts. On appeal, the appellate court rejected his argument that the aggravated criminal sexual abuse statute violated his equal protection rights because 16-year-olds who received parental consent to marry pursuant to 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/203 (2002) could engage in sexual conduct as the appellate court found that 16-year-olds under the two statutes were not similarly-situated individuals. it also found that e-mails were properly authenticated for the purpose of admitting them into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment on jury verdict of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicting him of reckless homicide and aggravated driving under the influence. He challenged jury instructions, the admission of certain evidence, comments made during closing argument, and imposition of a maximum extended term sentence pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3.2 (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Lay witnesses testified that defendant was very drunk when they saw him run a red light and hit an old man as he crossed the street with his three-year-old grandson. Defendant argued that the jury charge should not have included a modification of the pattern instructions for his offenses regarding fact findings about the victims' ages, but the court found no abuse of discretion in that the trial court had to modify the instruction to permit the jury to find facts needed to support sentencing enhancement. Photographic evidence was not more prejudicial than probative, and the lay witnesses were qualified by ordinary experience to comment on defendant's intoxication. A comment by the prosecutor during closing did not rise to the level of an attack on defense counsel's ethics. Since there was no evidence that prosecutors had any idea that one witness was falsely claiming to have given a statement to them soon after the offense, there was no showing of knowing reliance on perjured testimony. Finally, the trial court had properly weighed factors in both aggravation and mitigation in determining what sentence to impose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered that a tax deed be issued to the property buyer. The property resident filed a motion to vacate the tax deed, which the trial court denied. The property resident then filed motions to vacate the tax deed under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat.

The trial court denied those two motions. The property buyer's posttrial motion was not directed against that judgment. On appeal, the appellate court found that it did not have jurisdiction over an appeal from the trial court's denial of the initial motion to vacate since no timely appeal was filed. However, it found that the property buyer's motion that was not directed against the judgment did not nullify the property resident's notice of appeal of the denial of her two motions. It also found that no error occurred in denying her 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1401 (2002) motion to vacate and that 35 Ill. Comp. Stat.

The trial court dismissed the landowners' complaint pursuant to &sect; 2-615 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-615 (2002)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case concerned defendants' plans for the construction of a roadway to connect two interstate highways. On appeal, the landowners contended that their second amended complaint for declaratory relief properly stated a claim sufficient to avoid dismissal under &sect; 2-615; substantively, the landowners claimed that &sect; 4-510 (605 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-510 (2002)) of the Illinois Highway Code, 605 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-101 et seq. (2002), violated due process by allowing the State to effect a taking of the landowners' property without just compensation. The appeals court found the landowners' contention that 605 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-510 (2002) dispensed with the procedural requirements of eminent domain law was not borne out by the plain language of &sect; 4-510. The court saw nothing in &sect; 4-510 that circumvented the constitutional requirements of the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Once defendants decided to acquire the landowners' land other than by purchase, they had to employ condemnation proceedings under the eminent domain law, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-101 et seq. (2002), to accomplish their purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, 13 state agencies to which defendant employees received four-year term appointments beginning in 2002, appealed from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) judgment affirming the Illinois Civil Service Commission's decision reinstating them after their positions were terminated by an incoming governor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2003, the governor fired approximately 60 employees appointed by the previous administration in 2002 to four-year terms in state government jobs. The appeals of 27 employees came before the Commission, which reinstated them. The appeals court agreed with the state agencies that the Commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction over 20 of the 27 employees since those employees were not &quot;appointed under the rules and after examination&quot; as required by &sect; 11 (20 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 415/11 (2000)) of the Personnel Code, 20 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 415/1 et seq. (2000). As to the remaining employees, although the Commission had jurisdiction over their terminations, rule changes authorizing the term positions, promulgated by the Department of Central Management Services under the previous administration, were void ab initio because they contradicted the Personnel Code. When the employees were discharged, they were within the probationary period in effect previously and were subject to termination at will by the incoming administration. 5 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 100/5-10(c) (2000) was inapplicable, and the employees could not rely on it to validate the amendments.</SPAN></P>

The agencies' request to order all of the employees to disgorge the back pay and benefits they received since they were reinstated by the Commission was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Lake County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a judgment in a personal injury and wrongful death case which struck the affidavit of plaintiff injured party's retained expert witness because he was not qualified to render a professional opinion since he was not licensed as a professional engineer in Illinois. After denying the injured party's motion to reconsider, the trial court granted the injured party's motion for an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party alleged in her complaint that defendants' alleged design defect caused the auto accident that resulted in her injuries and the deaths of two other people. The trial court granted defendants' motion to strike the affidavit of her retained expert because he was not licensed as a professional engineer in Illinois pursuant to the Illinois Professional Engineering Practice Act of 1989, 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 325/1 et seq. (2002). The trial court granted the injured party's motion for interlocutory appeal and certified two questions for review. As to the first question, the appellate court found that it could not determine whether the engineer's retention as an opinion witness in the case constituted the unlicensed practice of professional engineering under the Act because the initial determination of that question was relegated to the Department of Professional Regulation. On the second question, it found that the Van Breemen case did not control the issue of striking the affidavit. Finally, it found that the affidavit should not have been stricken because the engineer was not required to be licensed in Illinois in order to render an expert opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court declined to answer the first certified question, answered the second certified question in the negative, reversed the trial court's judgment striking the engineer's affidavit, and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contester's petition for an election contest alleged voter irregularities, including insufficient reasons given by physically incapacitated voters on their applications for absentee ballots, improper assistance given to disabled voters by members of the candidate's campaign, and illegal delivery or mailing of absentee ballots. The candidate asserted similar allegations in his petition as well as challenged the validity of 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/19-6 (2002). The court found that &sect; 19-6 was not preempted by federal law and did not place an undue burden upon disabled voters with regard to choosing who may assist them. The court found clear evidence that the candidate's campaign worker violated &sect; 19-6 by taking absentee ballot applications to voters, helping them fill them out and watching them do so, placing the applications in envelopes, providing stamps, and mailing the applications. That campaign worker also helped voters following receipt of their ballot by returning to their homes and helping them fill out the ballots as well as mailing them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Illinois Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Guaranty Association petitioned the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for review of appellee Director of the Illinois Department of Insurance's decisions that the Association was liable to appellee health care providers for services rendered an insolvent HMO's enrollees. The complaints were dismissed. After appeal, the trial court affirmed awards of interest and hearing costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The providers submitted claims to the Association for services rendered to an insolvent HMO's enrollees. The providers sought review of the Association's denial of their claims by the Director, under the Illinois Health Maintenance Organization Guaranty Association Law, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 125/6-1 et seq. (2000). The hearing officers found the Association liable to 20 of the 24 providers for their principal claims and interest. The Director approved the hearing officers' decisions on the principal claims, and awarded hearing costs and interest. Rather than request any rehearings, the Association filed 24 complaints for administrative review in the trial court. On appeal, the court found that (1) the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine required that the Association file motions for rehearing with the Department before filing complaints for administrative review in the trial court; (2) the notices of appeal did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to enter the monetary judgments; (3) the hearing costs assessed were proper; and (4) the trial court's refusal to impose prejudgment interest as provided by a settlement agreement was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part as to the dismissal of the complaints, the judgments awarding the principal amounts and hearing costs, the imposition of post-judgment interest, and the imposition of prejudgment interest in favor of all but one of the providers. The imposition of prejudgment interest to one provider was vacated, and the case was remanded for recalculation of prejudgment interest owed to that provider.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Nine employees filed wage claim applications with the state labor department pursuant to the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act, 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 115/1 et seq. (2002) (Act), alleging that the businessman failed to pay them for unpaid vacation time. A hearing officer conducted an informal investigation and found him responsible for the payments. The state labor department then issued of wage payment demand to the businessman and indicated to him that its investigation of the matter disclosed &quot;apparent&quot; Act violations. Eventually, he tendered full payment in compliance with the wage payment demand and expressed a desire to appeal. The trial court treated his request as one for a common law writ of certiorari and reversed the state labor department's determination. On appeal, the appellate court found that the state labor department's wage payment demand was not subject to administrative review under the common law writ of certiorari because the wage payment demand did not adjudicate any rights and the state labor department had been acting in an investigative, but not quasi-judicial, role in its proceedings under the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a stipulated bench trial defendant was convicted of unlawful manufacture of a controlled substance containing methamphetamine and possession with intent to deliver cannabis. The Circuit Court of Marion County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms of 15 years on the manufacturing conviction and 5 years on the intent-to-deliver conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the search warrant was unconstitutional and the items seized should have been suppressed because the place to be searched and the items to be seized were not identified with particularity. The appellate court found no error, noting that, inter alia, there was no evidence that the search was executed at the wrong location and the warrant listed the items to be seized such that the trained officer could easily identify them as contraband. Next, the appellate court found no merit in defendant's argument that the penalty provisions for unlawful manufacture of a controlled substance containing methamphetamine constituted unconstitutional disproportionate penalties, noting the conduct of a methamphetamine manufacturer was sufficiently different from that of a distributor that proportionate review was inappropriate. As for defendant's contention that his conviction for possession of cannabis with intent to deliver should have been reduced to simple possession because the State failed to prove the intent-to-distribute element, the appellate court disagreed, concluding that the evidence, when taken together, established the element of intent to deliver cannabis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the 13th Judicial Circuit, La Salle County (Illinois), entered a final judgment of conviction after defendant was found guilty of controlled substance trafficking. Defendant was then sentenced to 18 years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a Massachusetts resident, was charged under the Controlled Substances Act (Act), 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 570/401.1(a) (2000), based upon a traffic stop of his accomplice's vehicle. A search revealed 5,000 vials of ketamine. At trial, the accomplice testified that he was transporting the vials cross-country to Boston and that the controlled substance belonged to defendant. Defendant claimed that he was merely passing through Illinois and did not intend to deliver the controlled substance in Illinois. He was convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison. On appeal, the appellate court found that the language of the Act plainly intended not only to punish those who deliver drugs into Illinois but also to punish the traffickers who travel through Illinois. It also found that defendant's sentence did not violate the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, even though controlled substance trafficking was punished more harshly than possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance because those statutory offenses did not share a common purpose and, thus, the legislature could reasonably punish those offenses differently.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of De Witt County (Illinois) of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred by admitting certain hearsay testimony in violation of the Confrontation Clause, U.S. Const. amend. VI, and 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10 (2000) and that he was denied a fair trial by the prosecutor's rebuttal argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's mother, a child advocate, and one of the victim's friends testified at a &sect; 115-10 hearing about statements the victim made regarding her attack. The trial court admitted the statements made to the mother and to the advocate. The victim also testified at trial. She related the events leading up to the attack and the events that occurred immediately thereafter. She did not answer questions about the attack itself, and defense counsel chose not explore the attack during cross-examination. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that (1) the Confrontation Clause was not a factor regarding the victim's statements because the victim testified and was available for full cross-examination; (2) the victim's statements were admissible under &sect; 115-10, even though they were not made until 33 days after the attack, where the victim's lack of understanding of the term &quot;penetration&quot; and the consistency of her statements indicated she had not been &quot;coached&quot; on what to say; and (3) defendant waived his right to appeal from errors he claimed were made in the prosecution's closing argument by failing to promptly object, and the claimed errors did not constitute plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) entered a judgment that found defendant guilty of violating the Sex Offender Registration Act, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/1 et seq. (2000). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the sexual exploitation of a child, a Class A misdemeanor. As a result, he was required to register as a sex offender and to report any change of address pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/3, 6 (2000). However, he did neither. He was then charged with failing to register as a sex offender. Failing to register as a sex offender, as required under the Sex Offender Registration Act, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/1 et seq. (2000), was a felony. Thus, failing to register was punished more severely than defendant's underlying offense. Defendant's motion to dismiss contending that the penalty portion of the Act was unconstitutional as applied to him because of its disproportionality was denied. On appeal, the appellate court found that the Proportionate Penalties Clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, had not been violated. It so concluded because it found that the purposes of the Act and the sexual-exploitation-of-a-child statute were distinct, especially since the Act had the additional purpose of tracking the movements of sexual offenders to prevent the recurrence of attacks on adults as well as children.</SPAN></P>

Defendant IDPR Director suspended the nurse's license for three years, followed by two years' probation, fined her $ 2,500, and required her to complete a 12-hour ethics course. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) affirmed these administrative orders. The nurse appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the nurse raised numerous issues. The appellate court concluded that the IDPR did not err in ordering her to cease and desist the practice of midwifery and the Director did not err in suspending her license because the nurse could only engage in midwifery and advanced practice nursing if she complied with the licensing requirements of the Nursing and Advanced Practice Nursing Act, 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 65/5-1 (2000), and she failed to comply with the requirements. In addition, the Nursing Act had previously been held not to be unconstitutionally vague. Also, the nurse's due process claims failed because she received notice of the charges and enjoyed a hearing before an impartial tribunal, at which she was represented by counsel and was allowed to cross-examine witnesses, present evidence in her own defense and inspect documentary evidence against her. Finally, the suspension of the nurse's license, followed by probation and a fine, was reasonably related to the purpose of the Nursing Act and was affirmed. However, no argument was provided explaining the relevance of the 12-hour ethics course to the purposes of the Nursing Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the orders requiring the nurse to cease and desist the practice of midwifery and suspending her nursing license and fining her; the appellate court vacated the requirement that the nurse complete an ethics course.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father was the custodial parent. The mother paid child support. She left a job in Illinois to move to Indiana, where she accepted a lower-paying job. She claimed that she intended to pursue further education. She sought a child support reduction, and due to the fact that distance prevented her from maintaining a prior visitation schedule, she sought grandparent visitation for her parents. The court affirmed the trial court. There was no basis for modification of the support obligation. The mother voluntarily left a good paying job and accepted the lower paying job. Her educational plans were vague at best. Better paying jobs were available without leaving the state, and it appeared that the move was meant as a way to evade her financial responsibilities. As to visitation, like court ordered grandparent visitation under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/607(b)(1), (b)(3) (2000), prior common law that would have authorized such visitation was also unconstitutional. Such visitation could not be ordered absent an agreement between the parties.</SPAN></P>

However, he kept his address in the forum county and spent a great deal of time there. Thereafter, defendant's father asked defendant to run for election to the county board of the forum county. Defendant filed a statement of candidacy that stated his residence was in the forum county. He was then successfully elected to the county board of the forum county. The State later filed an information against him and alleged he committed perjury by stating in his statement of candidacy that his residence was in the forum county rather than in the county where he was attending school. Defendant was convicted on that charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him for criminal sexual assault and predatory criminal sexual assault of a child (PCSA) in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-14.1 (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions, arguing that the admission of certain statements by the victim violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, that the State failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and that he was improperly convicted of multiple crimes based upon the same conduct. The court found that the trial court properly admitted hearsay statements that the child-victim made to her mother and to her grandmother in which she accused defendant of pinching and kissing her vaginal area. The statements were made to family members and were not made to governmental personnel, so they were not &quot;testimonial&quot; statements. Accordingly, the indicia of reliability framework attached to their admissibility and the hearsay exception set forth in &sect; 115-10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10 (2000), determined that the statements were properly admissible. Moreover, when combined with the evidence of defendant's confession, there was sufficient evidence to show the State proved defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, plaintiff billboard owners challenged decisions in their separate cases before the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which dismissed some of their claims against defendant city for writing tickets due to failure to remove billboards. The dismissals were based on alleged time bars of the owners' claims under &sect; 7-101 of the Eminent Domain Act (EDA), 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-101 (2002) and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city zoning ordinance was amended to ban billboards, though it provided a seven-year grace period. The city began enforcing the ban after the grace period by issuing tickets, which the owners received. They brought separate actions against the city, including claims under the EDA and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Those claims were dismissed in each action on statute of limitations grounds. The owners appealed, arguing the claims did not accrue until the grace period expired and tickets were issued. The court agreed that both kinds of claims accrued when the city issued the tickets, so the claims were timely and were improperly dismissed. The court found that a final determination of the applicability of the zoning ordinance to the owners' billboards did not occur until the city began issuing tickets. Since the &sect; 1983 actions were premised on a denial of procedural due process rights, they were timely filed within the two-year personal injury period applicable to &sect; 1983 actions. Moreover, the EDA claims did not accrue until there was a radical curtailment of the owners' property rights in the billboards. That also occurred when the tickets were issued and not when the ordinance was passed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissals in both cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a minor, was charged in a petition for adjudication of wardship with two counts each of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and aggravated criminal sexual assault. After a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), she was found delinquent and made a ward of the court. She filed an appeal from the charges, asserting that her conviction should be reversed because she was not allowed to cross-examine one of her accusers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether a child victim's out-of-court statements to her grandmother were admissible as evidence at trial. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Crawford reasoned that the testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial would not be admissible unless the witness was unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. Although some uncertainty remained regarding the exact definition of &quot;testimonial statements,&quot; the appeals court found the victim's statement to her grandmother fell within the purview of Crawford and was protected by the Confrontation Clause. The victim bore accusatory testimony against defendant which was offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, specifically, that defendant sexually assaulted her. Because defendant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the victim, defendant's constitutional rights were violated and she was entitled to a new adjudicatory hearing. The error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The appeals court found Crawford rendered &sect; 115-10 of the Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10 (2000)) unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The finding of delinquency was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for an adjudicatory hearing consistent with the opinion. Double jeopardy considerations did not prevent retrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police detective was told to bring defendant to the police station because his description matched that of a possible homicide suspect. The detective indicated that he saw no crime committed and had no involvement with defendant after bringing him to an interview room. The detective who interviewed defendant stated that he was investigating a murder, and that defendant was not accused of anything when he confessed. Defendant claimed that he was locked into the interview room for three days and that he was handcuffed. Further, he claimed that the police were misleading in their conversation with him. The trial court denied defendant's motions to quash arrest and to suppress evidence and statements. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. The court found that defendant was not &quot;arrested&quot; when he got into the police car and went to the police station. However, he was arrested while at the police station, in that he was not free to leave. The court found no probable cause to justify the arrest, which it deemed illegal. Nor was there attenuation in order to avoid suppression of defendant's statements. Accordingly, his confession should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The party filed a nominating petition for three candidates for county positions. The objector opposed, alleging that the petition violated 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/10-2 (2004) because it did not nominate candidates for other open county positions. The circuit court found that for that reason, the party's petition was insufficient and invalid. On appeal, the party argued that the petition did not violate the wording of 5/10-2 and that if the statute were interpreted to require a new political party to field a candidate for every office, it was unconstitutional. The court found that 5/10-2 plainly required a new political party to field a candidate for each open position in a political area and the party's petition did not nominate candidates for all open positions. Therefore, the petition was insufficient under 5/10-2 and was properly rejected. Also, the full-slate requirement in 5/10-2 was reasonable and nondiscriminatory in that it insured that a new party had sufficient support to be considered a party. Finally, candidates were not prevented from running for office because they could run as independents. The statute was properly interpreted and it was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision to deny the party's and the candidates' motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with several battery counts arising out of incidents while he was in the state-run youth center's custody.

However, he also stated he was taking &quot;a lot&quot; of psychotropic medication for bipolar disorder, mood swings, and an anxiety disorder. Eventually, he indicated that he knew the charges to which he was pleading guilty and that he had received enough time to speak with his attorney about his plea. The trial court found the plea was knowing and voluntary, accepted the plea, and sentenced defendant. In so doing, it gave him 29 days of credit for time in presentence custody. In addition, defendant was ordered to submit to DNA testing. On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court was not required to have sua sponte ordered a fitness hearing to determine defendant's fitness to plead guilty, as it could have determined that no bona fide doubt existed as to his fitness.

The Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois, found the petition to be moot due to the patient's subsequent discharge from the facility and denied his posttrial motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was purportedly admitted to the facility as a voluntary inpatient.

The motion was denied. He then filed the instant petition, asserting the same arguments. The appellate court held that despite the patient's release after filing the petition, the appeal was not moot since the scenario was capable of repetition and incapable of resolution on appeal within a constricted time frame. As there was no evidence the facility's director fulfilled his mandatory duty under 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-404 (2004) of the Illinois Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code to request, at the end of the patient's first 30 days of hospitalization, that he reaffirm his desire to continue voluntary treatment, the patient had been entitled to a declaratory judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which, in entering judgment dissolving his marriage to petitioner wife, denied his motion to vacate a non-paternity order, denied his petition for sibling visitation, and ordered the husband to pay attorney fees for a guardian ad litem.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties had one daughter before the wife sought a divorce. She then gave birth to a second daughter. The father filed a successful petition for establishment of non-paternity as to the second daughter, and attached DNA test results. Almost four years later, the husband filed an unsuccessful motion seeking to vacate that order and for sibling visitation. On appeal, the court affirmed, first finding that the issue of sibling visitation was moot because the parties had agreed to terms and the wife and second daughter were in Kentucky under that court's jurisdiction. Second, the order regarding non-paternity was not imposed by the trial court against the husband's wishes and was entered through a consent decree, which could not be set aside without a showing of fraud or public policy violation, factors not shown in the present case. Lastly, the court found that the trial court properly assessed guardian's fees under the Marriage Act, because the guardian's representation of the child was related to the father's parentage and sibling visitation, all of which were related to issues of custody, visitation, and parentage as required under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/506 (2002).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder committed while personally discharging a firearm. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to consecutive terms of 30 years for first degree murder and 20 years for personally discharging a firearm during the commission of the murder pursuant to Illinois' &quot;15/20/25-to-life&quot; mandatory sentencing enhancement provision, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(ii) (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the 20-year sentence enhancement violated the proportionality clause of the Illinois Constitution because it punished first degree murder committed while personally discharging a firearm more severely than similar offenses that constituted greater threats to the health and safety of the public, aggravated battery with a firearm and aggravated discharge of a firearm. The appellate court found no merit to that argument, noting that the legislative purpose behind the statutes differed; thus, comparative proportionality review was inappropriate. The appellate court held that the aggravated battery and aggravated discharge offenses constituted a less serious threat to publish health and safety. Therefore, the more severe punishment for defendant's crime was proper. The appellate court also found no reason to depart from judicial precedent to find that the enhancement violated due process. Finally, that appellate court found no merit to defendant's argument that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request that the trial court inquire about potential gang bias amongst the venire members, as gang evidence permeated the trial and both sides utilized it.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/19-6 (2002), was preempted by and violated the Voting Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 since it restricted the individuals with whom an absentee voter could entrust their ballot for mailing. The appeals court found the trial court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss, as &sect; 19-6 prevented a candidate or his or her agent from asserting undue influence upon a disabled voter and from manipulating that voter into voting for the candidate or the agent's candidate, and was designed to protect the rights of disabled voters. Respondent had not established that the federal legislature intended to preempt the rights of state legislatures to restrict absentee voting, and, particularly, who could return absentee ballots. Section 19-6 did not violate equal protection principles, as the burden placed upon absentee voters by the restriction on who could mail an absentee ballot was slight and nondiscriminatory and substantially contributed to the integrity of the election process.</SPAN></P>

Ann. 5/12-3.2(a)(2) (2002). Following a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) found defendant guilty and sentenced him to conditional discharge for a period of 12 months.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State did not succeed in proving him guilty of domestic battery beyond a reasonable doubt because the State failed to show that he intentionally or knowingly closed a door on his wife's foot. Defendant maintained that he only tried to close the door between the garage and the house one time and that he did not intentionally smash his wife's foot in the door. The appellate court declined to overrule the trial court's finding that the wife's testimony that defendant tried to close the door twice was more plausible. Defendant also argued that the statutory penalty for domestic battery violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution because it permitted judges to grant supervision to defendants convicted of a Class A misdemeanor such as simple battery, but denied the judge that same discretion for those defendants convicted of domestic battery, which was also a Class A misdemeanor. The appellate court held that there was no proportionality violation as battery and domestic battery did not share identical elements; battery applied to any individual, and domestic battery applied to all family or household members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner former husband sought to terminate respondent former wife's visitation with his son from a previous relationship. The Circuit Court of the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit, Whiteside County, Illinois, found that the stepparent visitation statute,&nbsp;750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/607(b)(1.5), was constitutional as applied to the facts of the case and denied the husband's petition. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the settlement agreement, the husband allowed the wife to visit his son. The wife made seven reports to the State alleging the child was abused. The appellate court noted the visitation agreement was based on 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/607(b)(1.5), which allowed a trial court to grant visitation to a step-parent if it would be in the best interest of the child. Section 607(b)(1.5) was facially unconstitutional, as it a placed a fit parent on equal footing with the step-parent in their attempts to convince the trial court that visitation was or was not in the child's best interest. As the statute was void ab initio, the trial court erred in finding an &quot;exception&quot; to its unconstitutionality - the husband's unfitness. There was no common law right to step-parent visitation in Illinois, and estoppel by remarriage did not apply because the wife's challenge was not to the judgment of dissolution as a whole, but only that portion granting her visitation. Equitable estoppel did not apply, as the wife did not claim she was induced to provide health care coverage for the child based on the husband's representations. The visitation agreement lacked consideration and was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a finance company, sued defendants, purchasers, to recover money owed on a motor vehicle. The purchasers filed a third-party complaint against third-party defendant, an automobile dealership, alleging violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/2B (2002). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted the dealership's motion to stay the litigation pending arbitration, and the purchasers appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the purchasers bought a car from the dealership, one of the purchasers signed an arbitration agreement. The purchasers attempted to return the vehicle, but the dealership refused to take the car back. In the third-party complaint, the purchasers argued that the dealership failed to give the purchasers notice of their right of rescission and refused to cancel the contract and accept return of the vehicle, in violation of the Consumer Fraud Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/2B. The purchasers argued that the trial court erred in finding that the arbitration agreement applied to the third-party action. The appellate court held that compliance with the Consumer Fraud Act was not a condition precedent to the existence of an enforceable contract. Moreover, the mere existence of the right to cancel under 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/2B in and of itself did not indicate that the exercise of that right would render the contract void or unenforceable. Accordingly, the trial court properly found that the issue of whether the Consumer Fraud Act was violated by the dealership was arbitrable.</SPAN></P>

(2002), defendant was committed to an agency for control, care, and treatment. He subsequently filed a petition for conditional release, and a motion challenging the constitutionality of the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was placed in a prison facility after the sexually violent person adjudication, the only facility approved for sexually violent persons. In a periodic reexamination, a doctor found that defendant had not received the proper care for his condition, and suggested that he be transferred to another facility where appropriate treatment could be rendered. Under the Act, the trial court had only two options regarding defendant's commitment: institutional care in a secure facility, or conditional release, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/40(b)(2) (2002). The appellate court found that because defendant's request would not have removed him from care in a secure facility, he was not asking for conditional release at all. Defendant asked the trial court to do more than identify goals for his treatment; he wanted an order telling the agency where to hold him, thus encroaching on the agency's statutory authority to determine the nature of the facility. As to defendant's claim that the Act was unconstitutional as applied to him, the appellate court held that defendant could seek appropriate relief through a properly drafted petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from a Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) order dismissing his declaratory judgment action against defendants, the Cook County sheriffs office, the Cook County State's Attorney's office and the Illinois State Police. His complaint sought a declaration that the Illinois Sex Offender Registration Act (Registration Act) (730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/2 (2002)) did not require him to register as a sex offender in Illinois.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was convicted of indecent assault under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, an offense not explicitly listed in &sect; 2(B) of the Registration Act. He was required to register as a sex offender in Illinois only if indecent assault was substantially equivalent to any of the offenses listed in &sect; 2(B). Defendants claimed the trial court properly dismissed his declaratory judgment action under &sect; 2-619 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-619 (2002), because indecent assault was substantially equivalent to the listed offense of criminal sexual abuse. Plaintiff was convicted of indecent assault for kissing the victim on the mouth, straddling her, and touching her breasts for sexual gratification. Proof of these facts also satisfied the elements required for criminal sexual abuse. Therefore, indecent assault was substantially equivalent to criminal sexual abuse and the conviction for indecent assault required him to register in Illinois as a sex offender. The trial court properly dismissed his &sect; 2-619 action. Contrary to plaintiff's claim, criminal sexual abuse did not require that the offense be committed against a child under 13.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicting him of child abduction in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/10-5 (2000). He argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him especially in the absence of a bill of particulars, that his 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/103-5 (1998) speedy trial rights were violated, and that he should not have been ordered to undergo certain tests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with child abduction after videotaping neighborhood children playing and then inviting them to his parents' condominium. He admitted to prurient thoughts while doing the videotaping, but there was no evidence indicating he ever tried to act on them. When defendant sought a bill of particulars regarding the actual unlawful purpose he was alleged to have had, an essential element of the offense, his motion was denied. That action was an abuse of discretion and resulted in &sect; 10-5 being unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, since it subjected him to a mandatory presumption of an unlawful purpose that he could not rebut. Furthermore, the State had not even amended the indictment to allege an unlawful purpose, a required element for criminal liability, until after the 120-day statutory speedy trial period had expired, so none of the delays that occurred during the period of an invalid indictment could be charged to defendant, and the amended indictment was subject to dismissal. Finally, the State conceded that ordering of HIV/AIDS and genetic marker tests was not warranted where there was no allegation of intent to engage in actual sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the matter for further proceedings which were to include dismissal of the indictment and expungement of the order requiring HIV/AIDS and genetic marker testing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been using marijuana and cocaine, drove away when a police car approached his vehicle. The officer gave chase, and defendant reached speeds of up to 80 miles per hour. He ran through a red light and collided with another vehicle. The occupants of the other vehicle were killed, as was the unborn fetus of one of the occupants. Defendant was convicted of reckless homicide. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that although at the time of defendant's trial, the Illinois Supreme Court had not yet found unconstitutional the mandatory statutory presumption in &sect; 9-3(b) of the Criminal Code of 1961, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3(b) (2000), which provided that being under the influence of alcohol or other drugs at the time of an alleged violation would be presumed to be evidence of a reckless act, another district appellate court had held the &sect; 9-3(b) mandatory presumption to be unconstitutional. Accordingly, the court found that it could assume that the trial judge was aware that the presumption was mandatory and thus unconstitutional and that the trial court did not rely on it in finding defendant guilty of reckless homicide.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him following a bench trial for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a church (UDC) in violation of &sect; 407(b)(2) of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, 720 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his UDC conviction, arguing that the State did not show he sold drugs near a place used for worship, a chain of custody was not established for evidence, and 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4-3(a)(3.5), which required him to give a DNA sample to the State, violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The court found that a rational trier of fact could have inferred the structure was used primarily for religious worship based solely on the fact that the name included the word &quot;church.&quot; The State satisfied its burden to show that reasonable measures were taken to protect the evidence from the time it was seized, and that it was improbable that the evidence was altered, so the chain of custody was established. Finally, defendant, as a convicted person, had a diminished protected privacy interest, his identity was a matter of state interest, and he lost any legitimate expectation of privacy in the identifying information derived from bodily sampling, such as DNA. In balancing the State's strong interest in identifying and deterring felons against defendant's diminished privacy rights, the court held that &sect; 5-4-3(a)(3.5) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a church.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a guilty plea to criminal sexual assault, defendant sought a declaration from the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Illinois) that the statute under which he was to be sentenced was unconstitutional because it failed to provide a probation option. The trial court denied the motion. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion to reconsider and asked the trial court to reduce his sentence. Defendant appealed from the denial of that motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the sentencing scheme violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970)), as well as the equal protection. Under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3(e) (2000), prior to its amendment, whether or not a defendant was eligible for probation depended on whether or not he was a family member of the victim. Probation could be imposed so that if a defendant was a major financial provider for the family, he or she could continue to do so. Thus, the distinction within the sentencing statute made for family members was not unconstitutional under the proportionate penalties clause. Since defendant and others similarly situated were not members of a suspect class, equal protection required only that there be a rational basis for a legislative classification that differentiates between them. If the defendant complied with certain conditions of probation, this might allow the defendant to continue providing financial support for the family, who could be victimized again if this support was extinguished. Accordingly, a rational basis existed to offer &quot;family member&quot; probation. No equal protection violation was found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1993, the inmate was convicted of two counts of armed robbery and was sentenced to concurrent extended prison terms of 55 years.

The second petition alleged that his 55-year extended term sentence was unconstitutional under Apprendi. That claim was rejected. The Illinois State Appellate Defender was permitted to withdraw as counsel for the inmate. There was no right to appointed counsel in a habeas corpus proceeding since such a proceeding was civil in nature. Under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 105/10(a) (2002), appointment of the State Appellate Defender was only in criminal and delinquent minor proceedings. As a result, there was no authority to appoint the State Appellate Defender as counsel in the appeal from a habeas corpus proceeding. There was no reason to dismiss the appeal due merely to the erroneous appointment of the State Appellate Defender as counsel. Dismissal, however, was appropriate. Apprendi did not apply because the inmate's direct appeal process was completed before Apprendi was decided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from the shooting death of a 17-year-old in a public housing complex, apparently after a series of arguments took place between the pair. During the final confrontation, defendant drew a gun and shot the victim twice. The trial judge found defendant guilty of first degree murder and of personally discharging the firearm that caused the victim's death, after rejecting defendant's assertions that the shooting was in self-defense or constituted second degree murder based upon an unreasonable belief in self-defense. The trial judge sentenced defendant to 45 years of incarceration, which included a 25-year enhancement for personally discharging the firearm that caused the death. The court upheld defendant's conviction for first degree murder and the trial court's rejection of defendant's provocation argument. The court found it was reasonable for the jury to have concluded that defendant's act of shooting the victim was wholly disproportionate to the mutual combat that had ensured between the pair. The court agreed that the mittimus required correction to reflect one conviction of a single count of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment on jury verdict of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicting her of solicitation of murder for hire and attempted first-degree murder of her husband, and sentencing her to concurrent terms of 23 and 10 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's primary defense after she was arrested for soliciting an undercover officer to kill her husband was that she had been rendered vulnerable to entrapment as defined at 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-12 (1998) by a pattern of spousal abuse. The appellate court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's exclusion of expert evidence to that effect, as it carried great potential to confuse the jury. Disclosure by a prosecutor to a potential defense witness, defendant's boyfriend, of matters that the People intended to raise on cross-examination did not unconstitutionally interfere with defendant's right to defend herself. The severe sentences mandated by statute for murder for hire did not violate defendant's rights to proportionality in sentencing or to due process, but it was error to sentence her to any term of imprisonment above the statutory minimum where the only factors cited by the trial court as aggravators were inherent in the offense. There was no violation of the &quot;one-act, one-crime rule&quot; where the acts giving rise to each conviction were distinct. Finally, a conceded error in the mittimus required correction on remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered resentencing, as well as correction of the mittimus to reflect the correct number of attempted murder counts, but otherwise affirmed. It remanded the matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Village of Elk Grove Village appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of plaintiff City of Chicago in the City's action seeking a declaration that an ordinance enacted by the Village, imposing a fee on any property owner who sought to disconnect property from the Village, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City sought to purchase Village properties to use in reconfiguring an airport. That required disconnection of the properties from the Village. The Village passed Elk Grove Village, Ill., Ordinance no. 2901, which imposed a fee for disconnecting property from the Village. The appellate court found that the ordinance was invalid. Elk Grove Village, Ill., Ordinance no. 2901 on its face applied to any disconnection. Because disconnection necessarily involved other municipalities than merely the Village, disconnection was solely within the power of the state to regulate pursuant to Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6. The Village argued that the ordinance did not regulate disconnection and did not conflict with statutory disconnection procedures, as it merely attempted to allocate the costs of its services. Elk Grove Village, Ill., Ordinance no. 2901 imposed notice requirements and filing fees for disconnection. The fee imposed by the Village, when multiplied by the minimum disconnection area of 20 acres under 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-3-6 (2002), amounted to $ 2.7 million. The Village was not permitted to burden access to the courts for disconnection proceedings to such an extent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) ordered defendant employer to pay a penalty for knowingly failing to pay child support from its employee's wages pursuant to &sect; 35 of the Income Withholding for Support Act, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 28/35 (2002). On appeal, petitioner argued the trial court miscalculated the penalty owed under the statute. The employer cross-appealed, arguing it owed no penalty and that &sect; 35 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered the employer to pay $ 38,100. Petitioner claimed the &sect; 35 penalty should be assessed on all eight paychecks the employee received from the employer. The appellate court found the first four paychecks, issued prior to service of a 2000 support order, were not subject to the penalty provision. The trial court correctly determined that only the last three paychecks were subject to the penalty. As to the final three paychecks, the court agreed with petitioner that the trial court erred in calculating the penalty, and that $ 90,600 was the proper penalty, as service of a 1997 support order on the employer was valid. The trial court expressly found the employer knowingly failed to pay amounts withheld from the final three paychecks. The employer's actions raised the presumption of a knowing violation. Section 35 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied because the $ 100-per-day penalty was not included in &sect; 50 (750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 28/50 (2002)), entitled &quot;Penalties,&quot;; the legislature chose to include the penalty provision in the section detailing the duties of an employer to withhold and pay over income upon being served with an income withholding notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment assessing a $ 38,100 penalty was reversed and a penalty of $ 90,600 was imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from his act of leaving his child in his vehicle while he attempted to go to a bookstore.

The court found that there was testimony that an ambulance was called to the scene after the child was discovered and that the child's vital signs were checked. However, there was no testimony that the child suffered probable physical or mental damage as a result of being left in the vehicle. There was no testimony regarding the internal temperature of the vehicle, which may have been conclusive evidence that defendant placed the child in circumstances that endangered her life or health. As a result, the court held that the State failed to meet its burden of proof in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial in 1983, petitioner was convicted of murder, armed robbery, and armed violence for his involvement in a store robbery. Petitioner appealed from the Circuit Court of Cook County's (Illinois) denial in 2002 of his pro se petition for relief from judgment filed pursuant to &sect; 2-1401 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1401 (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued his extended-term sentence, based upon the brutal or heinous behavior, violated Apprendi. The appellate court found the &sect; 2-1401 petition raised only a pure question of law - whether his extended-term sentence violated Apprendi. At the time of the claim's summary dismissal De La Paz, which held Apprendi did not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, was the controlling authority. Therefore, the circuit court properly found the Apprendi challenge frivolous and without merit. Petitioner disputed the extended-term portion of his sentence since this &quot;enhanced&quot; offense was uncharged in the indictment and not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. However, Ring, like Apprendi, which required proof of an aggravating factor to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, did not embody a substantive rule to be applied retroactively. Petitioner's challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment, for failure to charge him with &quot;brutal or heinous&quot; conduct, also failed. Where the State brought separate charges, each of which would support a separate conviction and were not lesser-included offenses of the other, the convictions for armed robbery and armed violence were proper.</SPAN></P>

Police arrested defendant at 2 p.m. on August 1, 1999, and he was interviewed by two detectives who initially asked him for his help in the investigation. Defendant was shown the videotape of the shooting four times and repeatedly told that he was identified by a witness as the shooter. Finally, 91 hours after the arrest, and 85 hours after the custodial detention began, defendant gave his videotaped statement, the first videotaped statement ever taken in Illinois. Then, on August 6, 1999, more than 110 hours after his arrest, defendant was presented before a judge for a probable cause determination. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress his statement, and he was convicted. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding that even if the statement were found to be voluntary under the Fifth Amendment, the State failed to show an emergency or extraordinary circumstance that would explain the violation of defendant's U.S. Const. amend. IV rights in delaying the probable cause hearing. Accordingly, the court found that the failure to suppress defendant's confession was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) summarily dismissed the petition pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-2.1 (2002). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the summary dismissal of his petition for declaratory judgment was improper under the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-101 et seq. (2002). The State argued that the pleading was in substance a post-conviction petition. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the pleading conformed in substance to the requirements for a complaint for declaratory judgment far better than to those for a postconviction petition. The core of the pleading was that the Department of Corrections misinterpreted his sentence, a claim not cognizable under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, as it did not relate to any flaw in the proceedings before his conviction. The appellate court further concluded that summarily dismissing defendant's pleading was an error that was not harmless, as it eviscerated defendant's right to be heard, the most basic procedural safeguard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police officer appealed an order from the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which affirmed the decision of defendant city police pension board denying him a disability pension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer was hired as a full-time police officer in 1982. In 1989, he injured his right knee playing football. A doctor examined him in 1991 and again in 1992, when his knee problems continued. In 1997, he twisted his right knee playing softball and underwent arthroscopic surgery. His knee problems continued. In 2002, he injured the same knee when he tumbled down an embankment while escorting a prisoner. Thereafter, he filed an application seeking a disability pension. The board denied the officer a line-of-duty disability pension under 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-114.1 (2002), in part because one of the three doctors selected by the board to examine the officer did not certify him as disabled pursuant to &sect; 3-115 of the Illinois Pension Code, 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-115 (2002). On appeal, the court found that the board correctly interpreted &sect; 3-115 as requiring that three physicians chosen by the police pension board file certificates of disability on an applicant's behalf in order to entitle an applicant to a disability pension. The court noted that whether the applicant was seeking line of duty or a non-duty pension was not pivotal to the question under &sect;&nbsp;3-115.</SPAN></P>

The officer saw a closing panel on the dashboard indicating the possible presence of an illegal secret compartment, and two bags containing large amounts of cash ($ 29,477) sitting on the floor. Defendant was arrested for operating a vehicle with an illegal secret compartment. Pursuant to a custodial search, defendant was found to be in possession of a small bag of a green leafy substance the officers suspected was cannabis. Thereafter, the officer drove the van to the police station for a warrantless dismantling and search. Officers found a handgun and four kilograms of cocaine hidden in compartments. Defendant was convicted on drug and weapons charges. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the trial court properly denied his motion to dismiss evidence obtained from the search of the van because, based on the totality of the circumstances confronting him at the scene, the officer had probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of defendant's minivan, including the dismantling at the station.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of committing first-degree murder in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(a)(1) (1998). In finding defendant guilty, the jury rejected defendant's claim that he was insane under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-2(a) (1998). After denying defendant's motion for a new trial, the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) sentenced him to 45 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the insanity statute was unconstitutional in that it violated equal protection, due process, and the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 11. The state supreme court had previously held that requiring a defendant to prove insanity did not violate due process. As to equal protection, defendant argued that the insanity statute impermissibly denied him an opportunity to escape criminal responsibility based on his inability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, while the intoxication statute permitted the defense. The appellate court concluded that the availability of an affirmative defense was not a suspect classification under the equal protection clause, and that the Illinois General Assembly had a rational basis for amending the definition of insanity. Thus, defendant's equal protection and due process rights were not violated. The appellate court also rejected defendant's claim that the insanity statute violated the proportionate penalties clause because defendant lacked standing to make such a claim where defendant was unable to show that he was actually an aggrieved party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was struck by defendant multiple times when an altercation between defendant and the victim occurred after the victim tried to prevent defendant from shoplifting. The victim testified that he did not receive any injuries. A police officer testified, however, that the victim had contusions on his face after the fight. The victim's testimony did not preclude a finding that he suffered bodily harm as required to satisfy the elements of aggravated battery under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-4(b)(15) (2002).  The officer's testimony that defendant suffered contusions on his face was sufficient to establish bodily harm under &sect; 12-4(b)(15), as evidence of bruises was sufficient. The order that defendant submit a biological sample for genetic marker testing pursuant to former 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2002) did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The State's interest in maintaining a bank of DNA samples to more accurately conduct criminal investigations exceeded defendant's expectations of privacy under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was resentenced by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) on four counts of attempted murder of a police officer and nine counts of unlawful use of a weapon (UUW) because the statute under which he was sentenced had been ruled unconstitutional. Defendant appealed his new sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On resentencing, the trial court imposed concurrent 35-year terms on the attempted murder convictions and a concurrent five-year term on the UUW charges. The sentence was basically the same sentence as had previously been imposed. Defendant asserted that the attempted murder sentences violated the proportionality clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970) because the penalty for attempted murder of a police officer was harsher than the penalty for second degree murder. The court disagreed. A comparative proportionality review of the two statutes was inappropriate because the statutory enhancement for attempted first degree murder of a police officer served a specific purpose that the second degree murder statute did not. It sought to both deter the intentional killing of police officers and to protect police officers who were performing their official duties. Further, the sentencing range for the attempted murder charges was not cruel, degrading, or wholly disproportionate to the crime. Finally, the record showed that the trial court carefully considered all of the mitigating and aggravating factors presented and the court could not say that the sentences were excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After denying defendant health care providers' motion to dismiss a medical malpractice action by plaintiffs, a patient and his wife, the Circuit Court of Coles County (Illinois) certified questions for interlocutory appeal regarding whether all requirements of former 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-622 (1996) were resurrected upon reenactment in 1998 Ill. Laws 49, and if so, whether the patient's complaint should have been dismissed with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's earlier complaint had been voluntarily dismissed. When he and his wife filed a new complaint, it was again accompanied by affidavits, as required by &sect; 5/2-622, relating to expert certification and delays in obtaining it, but there was no affidavit to the effect that no prior action had been voluntarily dismissed. That requirement had been added in the 1996 version. Although that version of &sect; 2/622 had later been held unconstitutional, the highest court in Illinois had explicitly found no fault with &sect; 2/622 itself, and had authorized reenactment by the legislature. It was clear that this was what the legislature had intended in a prompt reenactment, so the 1996 requirements, including an affidavit regarding voluntary dismissals, continued to apply. Although the trial court normally had discretion to determine whether a dismissal was to be with or without prejudice, it had no discretion in the patient's case because the deficiency could not be cured in a refiling. The previous voluntary dismissal was a matter of record, so it would not be possible to attach an affidavit that it had not occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the requirements had been resurrected, and that since the complaint had not and could not have satisfied the requirements, dismissal with prejudice was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After vacating an appellate court order modifying a natural life sentence imposed on defendant after his conviction, at a second trial, of first-degree murder, the Supreme Court of Illinois issued two supervisory orders directing the appellate court to determine whether failure to have the jury make the findings justifying enhanced sentencing was harmless error and also directing the court to decide all other issues raised in defendant's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's original conviction and death sentence were reversed. A jury at his second trial also convicted him of first-degree murder, but with the least of three possible levels of culpability. Finding heinousness and brutality, the judge sentenced him to life in prison. The appellate court held, first, that since subsequent case law had vindicated use of anti-anxiety drugs, defendant could not argue that his right to testify was chilled by the possibility that his earlier testimony would be used to impeach him. The evidence did not support a lesser-included offense instruction. A juror's affidavit regarding misgivings felt and expressed in the jury room could not be used to impeach the verdict in the absence of any showing that jurors lied during voir dire. Most evidentiary rulings were within the judge's discretion, and one abuse was harmless error. With reluctance, since the Blakely decision suggested such error was never harmless, the court undertook, as directed, harmless error review of the trial court's imposition of a life sentence. It held that the jury in question, which struggled to reach a guilty verdict, would never have found facts supporting an enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction, but once again modified his sentence to one of 60 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In related cases, defendants, property owners and tenants, challenged orders from the Circuit Court of Kendall County (Illinois), which were in favor of plaintiff county on charges that they violated Kendall, Ill., County Zoning Ordinance (CZO) &sect; 7.00(H)(3)(b), which imposed fines on them, and which ordered them to remove a grain bin that was constructed too close to a roadway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county filed complaints alleging that the owners committed zoning violations on their property. Identical complaints were filed against the tenants. The complaints alleged that the location of a grain bin on the property was in violation of setback provisions in CZO &sect; 7.00(H)(3)(b). Following hearings, the trial court entered orders for an injunction to remove the bin and for convictions of the owners and the tenants for violating the CZO. After fines were assessed, the owners and the tenants appealed. The court found that the record did not show that the trial court balanced the equities, so it abused its discretion in issuing an injunction. Moreover, the evidence did not show that the tenants had knowledge that the location of the grain bin violated the CZO, or that they had the power to cure the violation, so the tenants could not be found to have violated the CZO. Finally, the fines imposed on the owners were partially invalid because there was not a clear preponderance of the evidence that the owners were subject to multiple fines. A remand for findings as to the proper sentencing of the owners was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders on the complaints against the tenants for a mandatory injunction and for a conviction of the tenants. The court affirmed the convictions on the complaints against the property owners, but the court remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) entered an order which found that it was in a child's best interests to remain under the care of the subsidized guardians appointed in a separate probate proceeding, discharged an agency as the child's guardian, terminated the wardship of the child, and closed the juvenile case. Respondents, the child's parents, appealed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents argued that the order improperly permitted the subsidized guardianship to continue indefinitely and prevented them from making further efforts to accomplish reunification with their child. The parents claimed that the order was akin to an order terminating their parental rights. The appellate court held that 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/2-28(2) (2002) of the Illinois Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/1-1 et seq. (2002), specifically authorized the permanent transfer of guardianship when other options were unavailable. The trial court found that none of the permanency goals detailed in the statute were appropriate. Under these circumstances, the trial court was authorized pursuant to 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/2-28(2)(E) to enter a permanency goal of subsidized guardianship. Additionally, after the trial court selected this goal, the agency was statutorily prohibited from providing further reunification services pursuant to 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/2-28(2). As the trial court was statutorily authorized to take the action that it did in this case, the appellate court held that the parents' allegations of error were without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33-3(a), (c) (1998), in connection with a delinquent debt defendant owed as a former town supervisor to a township for his mother-in-law's care at the county nursing home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a former town supervisor, was charged with several counts of official misconduct for failing to pay a debt to the town. His pre-trial motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds was denied and he was convicted on eight counts after a bench trial. On appeal, defendant argued that 60 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 1/70-15(c)(v) (1998) was too ambiguous to supply a mandatory duty that defendant allegedly failed to perform, and that the State failed to prove the counts beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that charges that defendant failed to include his debt in a required annual statement was a mandatory duty that substantiated the charges of misconduct under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33-3(a) and was not unconstitutionally vague. However, the State failed to charge that defendant's acts were in excess of his lawful authority or violated an identifiable law to substantiate convictions under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33-3(c). Finally, the court held that three of the counts were not properly filed within six years, as required by 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6(b) (1998), though the other counts were timely charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed five of the eight convictions of official misconduct, but affirmed on three of the counts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder committed by personally discharging a firearm. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to a term of 40 years for the murder, with 25 years added pursuant to &sect; 5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(iii) of the Unified Code of Corrections, codified at 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(iii) (2000), for a total sentence of 65 years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The prosecution's case depended on the identification testimony of four witnesses. The appellate court found that all had been at the club, the scene of the shooting, for some time prior to the murder, and in the crowd they saw the murderer speak with the victim for several minutes. In addition, despite some differences, the appellate court could not say that the prosecution's witnesses gave such severely inconsistent testimony that no rational trier of fact could rely on their identifications of defendant as the shooter. Next, the appellate court concluded that defendant's ineffective assistance claim failed because counsel's decision to abandon impeachment of a prosecution witness was tactical after some testimony led to bolstering the witness's testimony. Finally, the appellate court upheld defendant's sentence, concluding that it was not disproportionate and was not double-enhanced, as defendant's personal discharge of the fatal firearm was an additional element not implicit in the included offense of murder in which defendant personally discharged a firearm.</SPAN></P>

McIntyre, Judge, Presiding.  <BR>Franz v. Calaco Dev. Corp., 322 Ill. App. 3d 941, 751 N.E.2d 1250, 2001 Ill. App. LEXIS 482, 256 Ill. Dec. 413 (Ill. App. Ct. 2d Dist., 2001)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In appeal No. 2-03-0672, order affirmed; in appeal No. 2-03-0699 judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part; cause remanded with directions.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff limited partner sued defendants, the general partner and the chief operating officer, for breach of a partnership agreement and breach of fiduciary duty. Defendants counterclaimed for declaratory judgment. The Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois) found for the partner on his claims against the general partner and on the counterclaims, and against the partner on the claim against the operating officer. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partner claimed that even though the operating officer was not a signatory to the agreement, he should have been found to have breached a fiduciary duty because he was so involved in the partnership that he created a fiduciary relationship between himself and the partners. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the written contract was the determinative factor. The partner also claimed that he was entitled to punitive damages for the general partner's breach. Because the appellate court determined that a reasonable person could have ruled the way the trial court did, the appellate court found no abuse of discretion. Next, the appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in failing to hold the partner liable under the Illinois Mortgage Act, 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 905/1 et seq. (2002), for failing to release the mortgage after the debt had been paid. As such, the general partner was entitled to recover statutory damages and reasonable attorney's fees. Finally, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision denying the general partner's claim for interest on loans to the partnership because the evidence showed that the loans were executed in bad faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's holdings in favor of the operating officer on the fiduciary duty claim, that punitive damages should not be imposed against the general partner, denying interest payments to the general partner for loans to the partnership, and valuing the property were affirmed. The decision denying recovery to the general partner under the Illinois Mortgage Act was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial because he was required to wear a stun belt without the trial court determining that it was necessary. While the appellate court agreed that such was a due process violation, the appellate court found that defendant failed to show that the error prejudiced him to the extent that it deprived him of a fair trial. In so deciding, the appellate court noted that defendant did not testify, the stun belt did not hamper the presentation of his defense, and there was no evidence that the jury was aware that defendant was wearing the belt. In addition, defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed because the evidence against him was overwhelming and thus, defendant could not prove he was prejudiced. Defendant also argued that his sentence violated the ex post facto and double jeopardy clauses of the United States and Illinois Constitutions. The appellate court found no error, noting that, inter alia, the statutory change was procedural and not substantive, and that defendant was tried for the same offense at both trials and thus, was not placed in double jeopardy for being retried following his successful appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(a) (2000). After a jury trial, he was acquitted. Defendant petitioned under &sect; 5(a) of the Criminal Identification Act, codified at 20 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 2630/5(a) (2002), to expunge the records of his arrest. The Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) denied the petition with prejudice. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to expunge his arrest records because the State failed to prove a compelling need to preserve them. The appellate court noted that under 20 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 2630/5(a) (2000), the court could, but was not required to, grant such relief to those meeting the requirements of &sect; 5(a) of the Act. In examining the relevant factors, the appellate court noted that, in favor of expungement was defendant's age and lack of criminal history. However, the appellate court also noted that, inter alia, there was a lot of circumstantial evidence against defendant and that expungement was not necessary for employment purposes because defendant worked for a family business. As for defendant's contention that the trial court erred in denying the petition to expunge with prejudice, the appellate court found no error, noting that contrary to defendant's contention, the doctrine of res judicata did not bar him from filing a new petition for expungement alleging additional facts not extant on the date the trial court denied the initial petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant convicted on a jury verdict in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of armed robbery and vehicular invasion appealed that portion of his sentence that required him to submit a sample of blood for DNA analysis. He argued that such DNA extraction under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2002) violated his Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 5-4-3 had originally applied only to persons convicted of sex offenses, but the version applied to defendant called for collection of samples from many kinds of convicted felons. He argued that it was unduly intrusive and applied to a group of offenders that was too broad, rather than being narrowly tailored to detection of sex offenders, for which DNA evidence was especially helpful. The appellate court applied both tests that courts had used in determining whether DNA extraction statutes violated the Fourth Amendment--the special needs test, under which a warrantless, suspicionless search could only be justified if it met a special need that went beyond normal law enforcement activities, and the balancing test, under which the State's interest was balanced against the intrusion on privacy--and found the statute constitutional under both. Building an identification database went beyond ordinary law enforcement activities but fulfilled a special need to identify felons, and the State's interest in detecting offenders far outweighed the minimal intrusion of a blood sample collection from a convicted felon whose expectation of privacy was already diminished.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate pled guilty to first degree murder. He did not file a motion seeking to vacate his guilty plea, a motion to reconsider his sentence, or a direct appeal from his conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's petition for transcripts and common law records cited Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 606, which dealt with direct appeals; however, the time for him to have filed a direct appeal had expired. The appellate court held that his petition could not be characterized as a postconviction petition since no gist of a constitutional claim for relief was presented in it, and only issues of constitutional magnitude were cognizable under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1 et seq. (2000). He did not assert a violation of a statutory law, much less a substantial deprivation of a constitutional right. There was simply no basis presented in his petition for the transcripts he sought, and the circuit court acted within its discretion in rejecting his request for them. His petition was nothing more than a random request for free transcripts made without any pending litigation or proceedings in the circuit court. Not only was there no basis for the inmate's petition, there was no basis for his appeal. Under the circumstances, the denial of a request for free transcripts was not an appealable order and the appellate court had no jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of possession of a stolen motor vehicle and possession of a controlled substance, appealed his sentence of five years from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois). Defendant contended, inter alia, that the trial court's order, pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4-3 (2002), which compelled defendant to provide a blood sample for DNA identification databases, violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of heroin. The parties stipulated to an expert's testimony that the substance recovered was heroin. The appellate court held that the Fourth Amendment was not offended by 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4-3. Incarcerated felons had a substantially diminished expectation of privacy. The testing, by needle or swab, was minimally intrusive. The State was not investigating a particular or specific crime. It was conducting a technologically accurate identification procedure that would enhance the administration of justice, reaching back to solve past crimes and extending forward to identify future offenders, convicting the guilty and acquitting the innocent. Defendant waived his right to challenge an expert witness as he stipulated to the expert's findings. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's request for treatment alternatives for safe communities (TASC) probation. The trial court reviewed defendant's drug abuse, earlier probation violations, failure to complete boot camp, and the parole violation before imposing the sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was employed by a subcontractor as a carpenter on a construction site owned by the contractor. He alleged that he was injured when he fell through an opening in a floor when he tried to hold up a collapsing wall. The contractor moved for summary judgment on the worker's negligence complaint, arguing it was not liable for the acts or omissions of its independent contractors under the retained control doctrine. The circuit court granted the motion and the worker appealed. The worker argued the circuit court failed to consider premises liability law, as expressed in Restatement (Second) of Torts &sect;&sect; 343 and 343A (1965). The court held that the circuit court erred by deciding purely under retained control without considering the distraction exception. It was for the jury to decide whether the contractor, as owner of the premises, exercised the care required towards the worker, as an invitee, where the worker was likely to be distracted from a known danger of a hole in the floor. Moreover, the exception applied whether or not the contractor created the hazard or could foresee the specific distraction. Since a jury question remained, summary judgment was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the contractor and the court remanded for further proceedings concerning the contractor's liability as the owner or possessor of the premises.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicting him of residential burglary and sentencing him to a term of 16 years' imprisonment as a Class X repeat offender. He argued that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing such a long sentence and that a requirement that he submit to taking of a DNA sample pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3(a)(3.5) (2002) violated the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Even though defendant's eight prior felony convictions qualified him as a Class X offender subject to three strikes sentencing, he argued that the trial court had abused its discretion in failing to consider the nonviolent nature of his crimes, his educational and religious activities, and his employment and family responsibilities as mitigating circumstances. The appellate court presumed that the trial court had considered those mitigators, noting that the fact that nothing had caused defendant to stop his criminal career could be regarded as one more reason to impose a long sentence. The fact that his younger co-defendant received a shorter sentence was not determinative. Defendant then challenged the taking of a DNA sample, arguing that in cases not involving sex offenders, there was no special need warranting such an intrusion. The appellate court determined the reasonableness of the intrusion by balancing the State's interest in identifying past and future offenders (and non-sex offenders could also be identified by DNA on occasion) against a convict's limited privacy interest and the minimal physical intrusion required, and found no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted in 1983 of murder, armed robbery, and armed violence. He was sentenced to an extended term of 70 years on the murder conviction. No direct appeal was taken but the inmate did file two unsuccessful postconviction petitions. He then filed his &sect; 2-1401 petition, which was summarily dismissed. On appeal, the inmate argued that the circuit court was without authority to summarily dismiss the petition, that his extended term sentence violated Ring, and that his convictions for armed robbery and armed violence were prohibited by the one-act, one-crime doctrine. The court affirmed, holding that (1) the circuit court could summarily dismiss a &sect; 2-1401 petition if it was frivolous; (2) the inmate's challenge to his sentence was frivolous and thus, summary dismissal of the &sect; 2-1401 petition was proper; (3) at the time sentence was entered, the convicting court was authorized to impose the extended sentence, and Ring could not be used retroactively to make an Apprendi challenge to the sentence; and (4) the inmate was properly convicted of both armed robbery and armed violence as they involved different acts and neither was a lesser included offense of the other.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Sangamon County (Illinois), granted summary judgment to defendants, a state official and state corrections department, after plaintiff inmate filed a pro se petition for writ of mandamus and sought the issuance of a writ of mandamus to compel them to lift recently-imposed restrictions on inmates like himself who presented an extremely high risk of escape. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state corrections department classified the inmate as an extremely high escape risk. A few years later, a correctional center warden and, soon thereafter, a warden for a different correctional center, issued bulletins that stated visitation restrictions for inmates designated as extremely high-level escape risk. The inmate filed a pro se petition for writ of mandamus against, inter alia, the state official and state corrections department. He alleged that the restrictions violated state law and his substantive due process rights. The trial court granted their motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the appellate court found that the inmate did not show that he had a clear right to legal relief, especially since the state official and the state corrections department did not violate state law in allowing the restrictions to be imposed, as those restrictions addressed safety and security concerns. It also found that he did not show his substantive due process rights were violated because the restrictions did not involve a fundamental right, and, thus, their rational relationship to safety and security concerns meant no constitutional violation occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that summarily dismissed, sua sponte, his 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1401 (2002) motion to vacate judgments convicting him of multiple murders and sentencing him to life in prison. He argued that the sentence violated Apprendi, and that his petition should not have been dismissed without a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although summary dismissals were permitted in Illinois post-conviction relief proceedings, the inmate, whose post-conviction relief efforts had already failed, sought relief under &sect; 2-1401 on grounds that the sentence imposed on him, based on the heinousness and brutality of his murders of co-workers, violated the rule of Apprendi. He made this argument even though it was established that Apprendi did not apply to cases where appeals had been exhausted prior to the decision or to the imposition of an extended-term prison sentence on a death eligible person such as the inmate. The appellate court held that it was error to summarily dismiss the petition, since statutory post-conviction proceedings were exceptions to the general rule that civil proceedings could not be dismissed without notice and a hearing. Nonetheless, since the inmate's only claim was an utterly meritless Apprendi argument, his petition could not possibly have succeeded and any error was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the court agreed that error had occurred, it affirmed the order of dismissal because any error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

The order also terminated her parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Contrary to the mother's contention, the appellate court found that the State's petition did not fail to state a cause of action and that the mother's failure to challenge the petition at trial waived her ability to do so on appeal. The appellate court also disagreed with the mother's contention that the trial court erred in admitting the parenting assessment team report because it was irrelevant to the issue of her fitness and was not a business record. The report extensively addressed conditions or circumstances of the mother that related to her fitness and provided additional information to the court, necessary for the court to render its decision on the mother's fitness. As for the mother's contention that the finding of unfitness was against the manifest weight of the evidence, the appellate court found that the evidence was not close. While the mother complied with many of the service goals and received some satisfactory ratings, she did not comply with the most important goals, i.e., she refused homemaker services to remedy the defects in her living arrangements, she often failed to satisfy the therapy goals, and she refused visitation when it suited her needs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from sexual intercourse with his 16-year-old neighbor. Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to give the jury an instruction stating that it was a defense to the charge that defendant reasonably believed the victim was at least 17 years old. The court was unable to say that the evidence was so clear and convincing as to justify the failure of the trial court to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense claimed by defendant that he reasonably thought the victim was 17 years or older. The court noted that defendant was not required to present any evidence that he believed the victim was at least 17 because the evidence that he did present that the victim engaged in playful and flirtatious behavior on the evening in question, coupled with the evidence presented by the State that defendant had never been advised of the victim's age, was sufficient to raise the affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a dispute with a rival gang, defendant's fellow gang member fatally shot a member of the rival gang. Defendant was found guilty of first degree murder on the theory of accountability. The court affirmed. Defendant filed a pro se postconviction petition, which the trial court summarily dismissed as frivolous and patently without merit. He then filed the instant successive pro se postconviction petition, alleging he was prejudiced by the trial court's failure to question jurors about gang bias during voir dire. The trial court summarily dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that defendant failed to satisfy the requirements of the cause and prejudice test under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, which required that a defendant show &quot;cause&quot; for failing to raise his issue in a prior proceeding and actual &quot;prejudice&quot; from the claimed error. Defendant argued that he met the cause requirement because the Illinois case that established the legal predicate for his gang bias claim was not decided until 2000; therefore, he could not raise it earlier. The court found that a lack of precedent could not serve as &quot;cause&quot; for failing to raise an issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which, following a bench trial, convicted him of aggravated robbery, sentenced him to 10 years in prison, and ordered him to submit DNA samples for genetic marker purposes pursuant to the Unified Code of Corrections, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4-3(a-5) (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a video store and approached the victim at the counter after all customers had left, asked him if he was wearing a bulletproof vest, questioned him with respect to whether he ever had been or presently wanted to be shot, and moved his hand to his waist in a grabbing motion two or three times while speaking to him. He then informed the victim that he was going to take property from the store, and filled two plastic bags with some 50 DVDs and two videotapes. Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery and subjected to the compulsory extraction of DNA. On appeal, the court affirmed, first finding that the aggravated robbery statute was not ill-defined or lacking of all objective criteria; thus it was not unconstitutionally vague so as to violate defendant's due process rights. The court then found that any slight intrusion upon defendant's diminished privacy rights in providing a sample for genetic marker collection was significantly outweighed by the state's compelling interests in preventing recidivism, correctly identifying offenders, and solving past and future crimes. Therefore, the court found that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4-3(a-5) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother appealed from order of the Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit, Tazewell County, Illinois, which found her to be an unfit parent and terminated her parental rights to a four-year-old child and ordered subsidized guardianship for a 15-year-old child. The petition to terminate parental rights had been filed by petitioner State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the mother asserted that the State failed to prove that she was an unfit parent. The court agreed. It was unclear which of two neglect proceedings the State based its termination petition on, but the court ruled that neither of the proceedings provided a basis for finding the mother unfit. The first proceeding dealt only with the 15-year-old. Although that child's father was found to have neglected the child, no finding was entered against the mother. Both children were involved in the second case. There, the mother was deemed to have neglected the children by allowing the four-year-old's father to have contact with him in violation of an order of protection the mother had been ordered to obtain. However, the trial court had no authority to order the mother to obtain the order of protection. Thus, violation of the order of protection could not, as a matter of law, be the basis for finding the mother had neglected her children. The court rejected the claim that the nine-month remedial period never began to run in the second proceeding because no dispositional hearing was held. That period began to run at the moment the children were adjudicated neglected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's ruling of unfitness, its order terminating the mother's rights, and its order for subsidized guardianship were reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) found defendant to be a sexually violent person pursuant to the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act (SVPA), 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/1 et seq. (2000), and ordered him committed to a Department of Human Services (DHS) treatment facility indefinitely. Defendant petitioned alternatively for conditional release or discharge. The trial court denied the petition, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that he was entitled to either a reversal of the original finding of sexual violence or a reversal of the denial of his conditional release petition. The appellate court declined to address the due process claim because defendant had not established that the evidence introduced at the original commitment hearing was closely balanced or that he was prejudiced. The appellate court held that persons committed under the SVPA and the Sexually Dangerous Persons Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 205/1.01 et seq. (2000), were not similarly situated and that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/65(a)(2) (2000) and 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/60(d) (2000) did not violate equal protection guarantees by allowing the State to prove its case for continued commitment by only clear and convincing evidence. The legislature could have rationally determined that persons who had already been adjudicated sexually violent beyond a reasonable doubt posed a greater risk to society than those whose sexual dangerousness had not been established in a prior criminal proceeding. Moreover, there was a legitimate state interest in protecting the public from sexually violent persons.</SPAN></P>

The trial court treated the petition as a petition for post-conviction relief under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 et seq., and summarily dismissed it. The petition was properly treated as a post-conviction petition because the pro se petition alleged matters cognizable under the Act. The inmate's claim was not jurisdictional in nature. Thus, a petition for habeas corpus was not the appropriate avenue for relief. The petition was properly dismissed without an evidentiary hearing, as the petition was without merit. Apprendi did not apply retroactively to the instant case. No prejudice resulted to the inmate by the trial court's decision to treat the petition as a post-conviction relief petition, as the inmate was permitted to file a post-conviction petition where fundamental fairness required.</SPAN></P>

The student accepted the offer and defendant told another student to go and get the female student. When she arrived, he pointed to the student and she began performing oral sex on him. Defendant was convicted of violating the indecent-solicitation-of-an-adult statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-6.5 (2000). The court originally affirmed, but the Illinois Supreme Court remanded for consideration of defendant's constitutional challenges. The court then reveresed the judgment, finding that the sentencing provisions in the statute violated the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970) and rendered the entire statute invalid. The court found that under the indecent-solicitation-of-an-adult statute, a nonviolent solicitation such as the one defendant was accused of was punished more harshly than a violent solitication where the solitication was accompanied with violence or the threat of violence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Cook County (Illinois) that summarily dismissed his third petition for post-conviction relief from that part of a judgment convicting him of attempted first-degree murder that sentenced him to an extended prison term, arguing that the sentence was disproportionately longer than a sentence for completed second-degree murder would have been, and that sentencing procedures violated Apprendi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attempted murder of which defendant was convicted arose out of a terrible beating he gave to a motorcyclist whose cycle had broken down. The victim never recovered. The enhanced sentence imposed on defendant far exceeded the sentencing range for second-degree murder, but the appellate court held that this did not necessarily make his sentence unconstitutionally disproportionate. The legislature was entitled to consider many factors in rating the seriousness of an offense, and the specific intent to kill, without any of the mitigating factors that might arise in a second-degree murder setting, could reasonably have been considered to make the offense more serious. Since the proportionate sentencing requirement of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 invalidated only sentences that were so disproportionate as to shock the conscience of the community, the sentence imposed on defendant passed constitutional muster. Defendant's Apprendi-based argument was without merit because the state's highest court had already ruled that Apprendi did not apply retroactively to cases, such as defendant's, in which the direct appeal process had already concluded before Apprendi was decided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment on jury verdict of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicting him of aggravated discharge of a weapon in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.2 (2002). He argued on appeal that the statute violated constitutional sentencing proportionality and substantive due process guarantees, and that he was prejudiced by the failure to instruct jurors regarding self-defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged as a principal since he drove a car that pursued the victim's car while his passengers repeatedly shot at the victim. His primary argument at trial was that he was not accountable for their actions, although he also presented witnesses who claimed that the victim's car was chasing defendant's car. The appellate court held, first, that the more severe sentences associated with aggravated discharge as opposed to reckless discharge of a firearm did not violate Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, because the two statutes were aimed at different types of unlawful activity differentiated by very different levels of scienter. Defendant also argued that the statute violated due process guarantees against overbreadth because it criminalized potentially innocent conduct, but the appellate court held that the absence of the words &quot;without lawful authority&quot; from the definition of the offense did not make it overbroad, since the statute plainly had a rational basis in the public interest in preventing people from shooting at other people. Finally, there was no plain error in failing to instruct the jury on self-defense, a theory never raised at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judgment of the Circuit Court affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of two counts of indecent seduction of a child under &sect; 11-6 of the Illinois Criminal Code of 1951, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-6 (2002). The Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to 30 months of probation with several conditions, including 12 months of periodic imprisonment, no contract with children under the age of 18, and sex offender treatment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the State failed to prove he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court disagreed, noting that, inter alia, the conversations made it clear that she informed defendant she was only 15. In addition, there was clear evidence that defendant communicated he wanted to make love to the girl. Next, defendant argued that he was entrapped because his conduct was incited and induced by the officer, who entered an adult-only chat room and pretended to an adult role-player. The appellate court found that defendant failed to admit essential elements of the offense by denying he knew or believed the girl to be under 17 and intended to engage in sexual conduct with her. In addition, defendant's assertions that the officer initiated contact, discussions of sex, and a meeting were not supported by the record. As for defendant's contention that a fatal variance existed between the indictment and the proof at trial, the appellate court concluded that any variance was neither material nor prejudicial. Finally, contrary to defendant's contention, the appellate court held that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-6 (2002) did not violate the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
