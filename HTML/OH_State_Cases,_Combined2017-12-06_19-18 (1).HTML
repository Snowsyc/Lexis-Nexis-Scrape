</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who pled guilty to engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity and theft from an elderly or disabled adult, among other things, appealed from the judgment of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas which overruled his motion for judicial release as being filed prematurely. Defendant filed the motion after serving 180 days of his prison sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying him judicial release under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.20 since the statute was unconstitutional. Specifically, defendant argued that the time restrictions for filing motions for judicial release found at Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.20(B)(4) violated equal protection. The appellate court held that &sect; 2920.20(B), as applied to defendant, survived defendant's challenge. Defendant was sentenced to a total of seven years. Accordingly, defendant became eligible for judicial release after serving five years of that sentence. The appellate court held there was a rational and reasonable basis for the graduated system imposed by &sect; 2920.20(B). The general assembly rationally and reasonably decided that offenders sentenced to prison terms of greater than five years but less than 10 years were serious enough offenders that society should be protected from them for a greater amount of time than offenders serving lesser terms of imprisonment. While his co-defendant was granted judicial release, the co-defendant was convicted of lesser degree felonies and sentenced to a shorter term of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee filed a complaint against defendants employer, the workers' compensation commission, and its administrator requesting a judgment declaring Ohio Rev.

The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in its decision granting summary judgment as &sect; 4123.511(J)(4) was constitutional. The issue of workers' compensation fraud had to be initially decided within the commission. Since the employee's rights regarding workers' compensation benefits were governed by statute and not by common law, the employee did not have a right to a jury trial under the Ohio Constitution regarding whether he improperly received workers' compensation funds. Additionally, the type of &quot;fraud&quot; contemplated by former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.511 was different than common law actions for fraud because the recoupment of workers' compensation funds improperly received by a claimant was controlled solely by statute pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.511(J)(1)-(4) (1999).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Ohio, sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which reversed a trial court decision and granted summary judgment to appellee city. It held that R.C. 9.68 was not a general law, that it limited municipalities' home rule powers under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, and that it violated the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had enacted several ordinances regulating firearms, including Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect;&sect; 627.08, 627.09, 627.10, 627A.02, 628.03, and 674.05. Thereafter, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 9.68. The city filed suit, resulting in summary judgment for the State. The trial court concluded that &sect; 9.68 was constitutional, did not violate the Home Rule Amendment, that it was a general law that was part of a comprehensive statewide legislative enactment, and that there was no violation of the single subject rule of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D). Further, the trial court found that the General Assembly did not abuse its legislative power. The court of appeals reversed that judgment and remanded for entry of summary judgment for the city. On further review, the court noted that the ordinances were an exercise of municipal police power and did not conflict with &sect; 9.68. It held that under the Canton test, &sect; 9.68 was a general law that displaced the municipal firearm ordinances, as it was part of a comprehensive statewide legislative enactment and applied uniformly across the State. Further, it did not unconstitutionally infringe on municipal home rule authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals, and the matter was remanded with directions for the court of appeals to address the city's assignment regarding the one subject rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was greater than the minimum authorized for his crime. The appellate court held the trial court did not violate his right to a jury trial when it sentenced him because he was not sentenced based on any additional factual findings not found by a jury, nor did he receive more than the maximum sentence authorized by the jury's findings. The Foster decision's severance of those portions of the sentencing statutes which it found to be unconstitutional was not an improper remedy. Foster did not violate due process because defendant was aware of his potential sentence when he committed his crime and Foster's remedial holding was not unexpected. The rule of lenity in R.C. &sect; 2901.04(A) did not apply to defendant's sentencing because the statute under which he was sentenced, R.C. &sect; 2929.14(A), was not rendered ambiguous by Foster, nor did it conflict with another statute. Defendant did not support his argument that his sentence was an abuse of discretion, so the argument was disregarded, under App. R. 12(A)(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Lyndhurst Municipal Court (Ohio) that denied his motion to dismiss and found him guilty of violating the Mayfield Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 917.14 (a) on 26 counts. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to two citizen complaints, a building inspector for the city visited defendant's property and noticed overgrowth in his back yard, in violation of Mayfield Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 917.14 (a). The city sent a letter to defendant, instructing him to cut his grass and to eliminate the grass growing in between the stones in his front yard. According to defendant, the wet conditions in the rear of his yard made it impossible to cut. Defendant received 25 citations. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss all 25 cases, raising issues of unconstitutionality and selective prosecution. The appellate court found that defendant failed to prove that the city enforced the ordinance against him arbitrarily. While he submitted evidence to demonstrate that other city residents may have been in violation of the ordinance, he failed to prove that those residents were the subject of a citizen complaint, upon which the city thereafter failed to respond. Further, defendant failed to demonstrate that the city enforced the ordinance against him in an arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant, the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), seeking a declaration that R.C. &sect; 145.46(E) was unconstitutional and that she was entitled to payment of the decedent's retirement benefits. A magistrate found that the wife was not entitled to the requested relief. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) adopted the magistrate's decision. The wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife was denied benefits because the decedent died before the effective date of his retirement plan change to a joint survivorship annuity. The appellate court held that the wife did not overcome the presumptive constitutionality of R.C. &sect; 145.46(E) as she failed to demonstrate that the statute violated her right to equal protection. Thus, the trial court properly determined that she was not entitled to the requested declaratory relief. The wife did not demonstrate that she was unconstitutionally treated differently than similarly situated persons. She was a widow of a PERS retiree, but she argued that she was unconstitutionally treated differently than widows of Police and Fire Pension Fund retirees, even though she conceded that the existence of separate retirement systems in Ohio was rational and constitutional. Thus, in the absence of evidence demonstrating that members of PERS and the Police and Fire Pension Fund, or their beneficiaries, were similarly situated, the wife was not constitutionally entitled to be treated the same, in regard to when a member's retirement plan change was effective, as widows of retirees under the Police and Fire Pension Fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner had a stockade fence built on her property. The fence was comprised of 24 posts set in concrete, 1104 pickets arranged vertically and held in place by 3 horizontal boards, which in turn were bolted to the posts. The side of the fence showing the supporting posts faced the neighbor's property. By complaint, the property owner was charged with building a privacy fence with its unfinished portion facing adjacent properties. The appellate court held the zoning resolution was not a criminal ordinance and was constitutional. It held the zoning resolution's use of the word &quot;unfinished&quot; referred to the supporting posts showing outward. It also held the township did not exceed its statutory authority in enacting the zoning resolution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress was denied. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted defendant of failure to comply with the order or signal of a police officer, in violation of R.C. 2921.331(B). he was sentenced to four months of community control sanctions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress because the officers did not abridge the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. Faced with a potentially violent and unpredictable situation late at night, coupled with the driver's physical resistance to a pat down and defendant's simultaneous furtive movements in the vehicle believed to be connected to the crime, the officers had articulable grounds to suspect criminal activity. The officers testified that defendant's furtive movements were consistent with an individual reaching for a weapon. Further, R.C. 2921.331(B) was constitutionally applied to defendant because the vehicle was moving. The officer's discharge of his weapon constituted a secondary visual signal for defendant to stop the operation of the vehicle at the time that he was in fact moving the vehicle. Finally, the conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because defendant disobeyed the officer's order to stop and accelerated the car away from the officers.</SPAN></P>

Chapter 2506, in the Licking County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) of the decisions of appellee township board of zoning appeals (board) denying the bank's appeal of a stop work order and its variance request. The trial court, on remand, affirmed the board's decisions, and the bank appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the county planning commission gave the bank a variance to build a driveway on an adjacent open space parcel, the township told the bank to stop building it. The appellate court held res judicata did not bar the township's decision that the driveway violated zoning rules because the variance concerned traffic safety, while the zoning restriction regulated driveways over open space, so nothing decided by the planning commission was relitigated. It was no abuse of discretion to find the open space was an enforceable area of a planned unit development because the township's acceptance of a preliminary plan supported this finding. It was no abuse of discretion to affirm the board's denial of the bank's variance request because Etna Township, Ohio, Zoning Res. art. 2 barred variances allowing establishment of a prohibited use. The board did not act unconstitutionally because (1) Etna Township, Ohio, Zoning Res. art. 2, &sect; 300 was not vague in requiring a zoning permit for the driveway, and (2) a claim that other &quot;reserve&quot; areas in the adjacent subdivision might allow vehicular access did not show an equal protection violation, as they were not similarly situated to the parcel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of attempted murder with firearm specifications. His sentence was reversed. His motion for a de novo sentencing hearing was denied. On a second remand, the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) advised him that, upon his release from prison, he would be subject to a mandatory term of five years of post-release control, and the consequences of violating post-release control. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of his resentencing under R.C. 2929.191. The appellate court held that the trial court's resentencing of defendant pursuant to R.C. 2929.191 was not unconstitutional. Any alleged conflict between Sup.R. 7 and R.C. 2929.191 would not have rendered the statute unconstitutional pursuant to Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(B) and R.C. 2929.191 did not conflict with Crim.R. 32(A). Because the part of defendant's sentence improperly imposing post-release control was void, he did not have a legitimate expectation of finality in his sentence and thus, his resentencing did not violate the Due Process or Double Jeopardy clauses. Finally, the trial court's application of R.C. 2929.191 did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because the statutory sentence-correction mechanism was in effect at the time the trial court conducted the de novo resentencing pursuant to a Foster remand. Additionally, because the indictment, sentencing entries, and other pleadings contained a date-stamp by the Mahoning County Clerk of Courts, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a worker and his spouse, appealed from a decision of the Portage County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, the owners of a home where the worker was cleaning a chimney and the worker's employer. The worker's action asserted negligence against the owners and an intentional tort against the employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was on the roof of the owners' home when a bucket started to slide off the roof. The worker ran after the bucket, and unable to stop, leapt off the roof. He sustained injuries in the fall. Summary judgment in favor of the owners was proper. Appellants failed to establish that the owners owed any duty to the worker because there was no evidence that the owners actively participated in the work the worker did. The worker's claim that R.C. 2745.01 (2005) was unconstitutional had merit. The statute retained the same substantive standard of proof for an intentional tort against an employer that had been found unconstitutional in Brady. Pursuant to Brady, Johnson, and the supplemental analysis set forth in Kiminski, R.C. 2745.01 was unconstitutional as it violated the standards in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 34, 35. As a result, the common law standard set fort in Fyffe was again the viable standard for intentional tort actions against an employer. Applying that standard, genuine issues of material fact existed regarding each of the three prongs of the Fyffe test such that summary judgment in favor of the employer was precluded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the owners. The appellate court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the employer. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Sub. H.B. 292, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2004), arising from a pretrial procedural ruling in a group of asbestos-related personal-injury cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants alleged that their non-malignant lung diseases were proximately caused by exposure to asbestos products associated with the companies. Numerous companies sought administrative dismissal of actions in which the claimants failed to present prima facie evidence of impairment, as required by R.C. 2307.92. The trial court held that the retroactive application of H.B. 292 violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. On appeal after procedural wrangling, the court held that the trial court's conclusion that R.C. 2307.91-2307.93 were incompatible with the Retroactivity Clause of &sect; 28 was error. The court noted that the statutory scheme was expressly intended to be applied retroactively, and that there was a &quot;savings clause&quot; under R.C. 2307.93 for use of prior law when appropriate. The court concluded that the statutory scheme was remedial or procedural, rather than substantive in nature. Further, it did not impair any vested rights of the claimants, as they only had an expectation of future benefits. Further, the law did not impose any new or additional burdens, duties, obligations, or liabilities on them. Definitions included under R.C. 2307.91 were proper for clarification purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arresting officer testified that he observed a vehicle approach a stop sign and that the vehicle did not make a complete stop at the sign. The officer testified that he saw that neither of the front seat passengers were wearing seat belts. Defendant agreed to a pat down search after defendant was unable to provide a driver's license, registration, or proof of insurance. The officer discovered a bag containing marijuana as a result of the search. The appellate court held that the officer had sufficient probable cause to stop the car based on his observation of traffic violations. The appellate court further held that the record demonstrated that the marijuana was immediately apparent to the officer as contraband, and therefore its subsequent removal was justified. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in failing to rule that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11 was unconstitutional when a court was required to suspend a person's driver's license for a minor misdemeanor drug offense. The appellate court held that defendant failed to rebut the presumption that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident argued that the Adam Walsh Act (Act), R.C. Chapter 2950, violated Ohio's Double Jeopardy Clause, Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The appellate court agreed, finding that the resident had an expectation of finality in that his reporting requirements would end in 2008. However, additional punitive measures were placed on him, as he was required to comply with the new registration requirements once a year for fifteen years. He was being punished a second time for the same offense. The Act violated the Separation of Powers Doctrine because the resident had every reasonable expectation of finality in the trial court's 1998 judgment entry. The Act was an unconstitutional retroactive law, as applied to the resident. It attached new burdens and disabilities to a past transaction. The retroactive application of the Act violated the prohibition against retroactive laws in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The Act could not be applied to those who entered plea agreements with the State following the 1997 amendments. The resident's other arguments were rendered moot, and would not be addressed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio appealed a decision from the Richland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which held that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008), Ohio's Adam Walsh Act (AWA), was unconstitutional both facially and as applied to appellee inmate. The inmate was convicted of attempting unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. The matter arose in the inmate's challenge to his sexual offender reclassification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of the sex offense. While incarcerated, he was notified that pursuant to the Adam Walsh Act (AWA) and R.C. Chapter 2950, as amended by S.B. 10, he was reclassified as a Tier II sex offender. The inmate filed a petition to contest the reclassification, wherein he challenged the classification and the application of the AWA to him. The trial court relied on another case holding in determining that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional because it violated the prohibitions against retroactive and ex post facto laws. It further held that the application of the AWA to the inmate was barred because he was previously sentenced and classified under the law in existence at the time of his original sentence. Accordingly, judgment was entered in favor of the inmate. On appeal by the State, the court relied on judicial precedent to find that the trial court decision was in error. Rather, S.B. 10 survived constitutional challenge with respect to ex post facto, retroactive laws, and the right to contract under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. Case No. 99-286: Appellee Daniel Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 1986, appellee Daniel Williams pleaded guilty to one count of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02 and one count of aggravated burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.11. Williams was then sentenced to an indefinite term of seven to twenty-five years on each count, to be served concurrently. In March 1997, pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2950, authorities at the London Correctional Institution recommended a sex offender classification hearing for Williams, and that he be classified as a &quot;sexual predator,&quot; which would subject Williams to the registration and notification provisions of R.C. Chapter 2950.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 1997, prior to his sex offender classification hearing and prior to his release from prison, Williams filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that R.C. Chapter 2950 is unconstitutional as applied to him. In its opinion, the trial court held that R.C. Chapter 2950 violates the Ex Post&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Facto Clause of the United States Constitution and the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution with regard to any sexual offender who was sentenced prior to January 1, 1997, the effective date of R.C. Chapter 2950. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1998, prior to the decision of the Eleventh District Court of Appeals, this court issued its opinion in State v. Cook (1998), 83 Ohio St. 3d 404, 700 N.E.2d 570, in which we held that R.C. Chapter 2950 is not a violation of either the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution or the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment on the grounds that R.C. Chapter 2950 violates Section 1, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. Case No. 99-764: Appellee Donald Worthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*3352]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  *4912 *347 In March 1995, appellee Donald Worthy pleaded guilty to two counts of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02, and one count of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05. The counts to which Worthy pleaded guilty involved child victims who were all under the age of thirteen. Worthy was sentenced to an indefinite term of ten to twenty-five&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  years on each count of rape, and one year on the gross sexual imposition count, with all sentences running concurrently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 1997, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction recommended that Worthy be adjudicated a &quot;sexual predator&quot; pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2950. Prior to his sex offender classification hearing and his release from prison, Worthy filed a motion to dismiss the recommendation that he be declared a &quot;sexual predator.&quot; The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, holding that R.C. Chapter 2950 violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution and the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution. The state filed a timely appeal. The court of appeals, relying on State v. Williams, 1999 Ohio App. LEXIS 217 (Jan. 29, 1999), Lake App. No. 97-L-191, unreported, 1999 WL 76633, affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. Case No. 99-765: Appellant Paul D. Suffecool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1983, appellant Paul D. Suffecool pleaded guilty to one count of statutory rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02, for raping a child under the age of thirteen. The trial court sentenced Suffecool to an indeterminate term of incarceration of seven to twenty-five&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  years. Suffecool also had prior convictions for the rape of a nineteen-year-old girl, and for the kidnapping of two teenagers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1998, prior to Suffecool's release from prison, a sex offender classification hearing was conducted pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2950. At the hearing, the state introduced evidence relating to Suffecool's convictions, a psychiatric evaluation, and statements made to police in which Suffecool admitted to having uncontrollable sexual urges for young girls. Defense counsel introduced evidence that Suffecool had participated in numerous counseling programs while in prison. The trial court adjudicated Suffecool as a &quot;sexual predator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suffecool appealed his sexual predator classification to the Fifth District Court of Appeals. Suffecool argued that R.C. Chapter 2950, inter alia, violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States and Ohio Constitutions, and that R.C. Chapter 2950 is unconstitutionally vague. The court of appeals held that R.C. Chapter 2950 is constitutional and affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was asked to determine whether Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 (1997) was unconstitutional. In two cases, the appellate court had reversed the convictions, holding that ch. 2950 was unconstitutional while, in the third case, the conviction was affirmed. After reviewing other states' sex offender registration laws as well as the legislation history, the court held that ch. 2950 was constitutional, neither violating the prohibitions again double jeopardy, bills of attainder or equal protection under both the federal and state constitutions, nor did it violate citizen's rights under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1. Although it impacted the lives of convicted sex offenders, ch. 2950 addressed legitimate governmental interests without a detrimental effect on individual constitutional rights. It did not violate a convicted sex offender's right of privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a judgment from the Ross County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which overruled his multiple challenges to his reclassification under R.C. 2950.031(E) as a Tier III sex offender pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2950, as amended by S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008). The inmate had been previously convicted of rape and he was previously classified as a sexually oriented offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate received notification of his new classification and registration duties, and he contested them under &sect; 2950.031(E). The trial court overruled the inmate's constitutional challenges. On appeal, the court agreed that the inmate's challenges to the constitutionality of Chapter 2950 lacked merit. It noted that as Chapter 2950 was civil rather than punitive in nature, there was no violation of the retroactivity prohibition under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The civil nature of Chapter 2950 also defeated the inmate's claim that reclassification constituted multiple punishments in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. As the inmate had no reasonable settled expectation of his registration obligations from the prior classification, there was no due process violation. There was no violation of the separation of powers doctrine because S.B. 10 did not impose on the power of the judiciary. There was no violation of the contract clause of the Ohio Constitution, as S.B. 10 did not impair any of the inmate's vested rights.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, he was notified that pursuant to the Adam Walsh Act (AWA) and R.C. 2950.01 et seq., as amended by S.B. 10, he was reclassified as a Tier III sex offender. The inmate filed a petition to contest the reclassification, wherein he challenged the classification and the application of the AWA to him. The trial court relied on another case holding in determining that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional because it violated the prohibitions against retroactive and ex post facto laws. Accordingly, judgment was entered in favor of the inmate. On appeal, the court noted that a precedent that was relied on by the trial court was reversed on appeal with respect to the unconstitutionality holding. The court relied on the appellate decision upholding the constitutionality of the legislative scheme in the precedential case to find that the trial court decision was in error. Rather, S.B. 10 survived constitutional challenge on a number of issues, including the right to contract under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

Code 4123-3-15 (2010) was amended to require the payment of final R.C. 4123.57(B) awards in one payment for an entire award or the balance remaining on the award. The employer contended that Ohio Admin. Code 4123-3-15(C)(3) could not be applied retroactively because the provision failed to clearly indicate a retroactive application. The claimant, who was rendered a quadriplegic in an industrial injury, contended that Ohio Admin. Code 4123-3-15(C) expressly indicated that it had retroactive application to final awards made prior to its effective date. The reviewing court found that, in the absence of language clearly indicating that the administrative code provision was intended to apply retroactively to final awards made prior to its effective date, the rule could not be retroactively applied pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. Furthermore, the provision affected a substantive right. Therefore, the employer was entitled to the writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held, in reliance on a prior decision regarding a prior version of R.C. 2745.01, that the statute violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 34 and 35. The supreme court held the prior decision's interpretation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 34 and 35 was flawed because it held those provisions limited the legislature's authority to enact employer intentional-tort legislation when, in fact, those provisions were affirmative grants of legislative authority in the areas of employment legislation and, specifically, workers' compensation, so the statute could not violate them, and Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35 did not forbid legislation affecting employees' tort recovery without affecting employees' receipt of workers' compensation. The trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the employer because, construing all materials in a light most favorable to the employee, nothing showed she could prove the employer committed a tortious act with the intent to injure her or that the employer acted with deliberate intent to cause her to suffer an injury, for purposes of R.C. 2745.01(A) and (B), so, under R.C. 2745.01, there was no genuine issue as to any material fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Ohio Lottery Commission sought review of the judgment entry of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) which reversed the Commission's revocation of the licenses of appellee sales agents and held that former Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3770-2-03(B)(1) was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to the agents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the agents extended credit to a friend to cover some wagers, including $ 490,000 over three days. The agent claimed that she was able to cover the cost of the bets with her own funds if the friend failed to pay for the loan. The agent telephoned another agent who placed a subsequent $ 40,000 wager for the friend on credit. The friend won some money, although not enough to cover the amount owed. Both of the friend's personal checks were dishonored. The agents had to make deposits of their own money into their respective lottery bank accounts to ensure that there were sufficient funds. The hearing examiner found that the agents violated former Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3770-2-03(B)(1) by accepting the wagers solely on the word of a customer. The appellate court held that it failed to see how the director's exclusive discretion to revoke a sales agent license would have aided an individual to conform his conduct to the regulation. Essentially, &quot;financial responsibility&quot; encompassed whatever conduct the director decided it should encompass. Thus, it violated due process of the laws.</SPAN></P>

Upon a report of the dogs' presence being filed with the county dog warden, one dog was given away, one was confiscated and destroyed, and one was kept by defendant. Defendant was charged by the city with local and state statutory violations. The trial court denied defendant's dismissal motion, finding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 955.22 and 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii), and Toledo, Ohio, Code &sect; 505.14(a) were constitutional, although it noted that pit bulls were not, as a breed, more dangerous than other breeds. On appeal, the court found that the statutes were unconstitutionally violative of procedural due process, as defendant could not rebut the presumption that his dogs were &quot;vicious&quot; before being charged. Further, the statutes were void for vagueness under that constitutional principle due to the subjective identification procedures. The statutes also violated equal protection and substantive due process where there was no rational basis to single out the pit bull as inherently dangerous, based on the current evidence regarding the breed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that defendant owned a repair shop for automobiles that was not classified as a &quot;motor vehicle sales lot.&quot; Therefore, he was not exempt from prosecution for violating Lakewood, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 1143.09. Further, the Building Department's request for summons, incorporated into the face of the complaint, spelled out all of the essential facts of the offense and was valid within the meaning of Ohio R.

It was clear that defendant was being cited for having a vehicle with expired license plates.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the trial court erred in not declaring Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.414(B)(1)(d)&nbsp;unconstitutional since it created an irrebuttable presumption of parental unfitness and included that presumption in determining the best interests of the child. The appellate court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.414(B)(1)(d) was constitutional on its face. Further, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.413 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.414 did not violate the mother's equal protection rights because they did not distinguish between groups of parents or treat similarly situated parents differently. The mother's unsupported assertions of unconstitutionality were insufficient to satisfy her burden. Additionally, because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.414(B)(1)(d) applied, in that the child had been in the agency's custody for 12 of 22 consecutive months, the trial court was not required to find parental unfitness before it terminated her parental rights. Finally, the trial court had sufficient evidence to find by clear and convincing evidence that the child's best interests were served by placing him in the permanent custody of the agency to facilitate his adoption into a permanent home.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;2335.39 motion for attorney fees and expenses from appellee Ohio Lottery Commission; the agents claimed that former Ohio Admin. Code &sect;&nbsp;3770-2-03(B)(1) was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a customer wagered approximately $ 490,000 on a lottery game, the lottery agents extended credit to the customer to cover the wagers. A hearing examiner found that the agents violated former Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3770-2-03(B)(1) and ordered the revocation of the agents' licenses. The trial court reversed the decision on the grounds that &sect; 3770-2-03(B)(1) was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to the agents. Thereafter, the agents sought attorney's fees under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2335.39 as the prevailing parties in the litigation. The appellate court held that the Lottery Commission was substantially justified in initiating the action against agents. It believed their conduct demonstrated financial irresponsibility justifying the revocation of the licenses. It was within the trial court's discretion to deny attorney fees and costs to the agents when they failed to show that statute was clearly unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the chief deputy treasurer stole $2,964,560 from the county treasury, the board of commissioners voted to remove relator former county treasurer for failing to pay over money pursuant to R.C. 321.38. An election was held and respondent current county treasurer was elected. The former treasurer filed an action for a writ of quo warranto, seeking to oust the current county treasurer from office and to be reinstated to that office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The current treasurer asserted that the former treasurer's quo warranto claim was both moot and barred by laches. The state supreme court held that the fact that there had been three successors since the former treasurer's removal did not bar his quo warranto claim. The former treasurer's term of office had not expired, he lacked an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, and the proceedings were not quasi-judicial. Further, he satisfied the burden to establish that R.C. 321.38 was unconstitutional on its face. R.C. 321.38 authorized the removal of elected county treasurers from office by county commissioners without the due process protections of a complaint and hearing that were required by Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 38. R.C. 321.38 was thus, irreconcilable with the constitutional provision. And, although the current treasurer was elected to the office, that midterm election occurred only because of the former treasurer's improper removal. Because R.C. 321.38 was unconstitutional, the removal of the former treasurer violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 38 and he was entitled to serve the remainder of his elected term, set to expire in September 2013.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writ of quo warranto to oust from office the current county treasurer and reinstate the former treasurer to office was granted.</SPAN></P>

The Summit County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division (Ohio), entered an order dismissing the charges and finding the ordinance unconstitutionally void for vagueness and overbroad.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred in finding Akron, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 138.26 unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the revised ordinance still allowed police officers to subjectively determine whether or not a citizen exhibited certain &quot;characteristics&quot; and thus were given unfettered discretion to determine whether a person's conduct &quot;manifested&quot; drug activity, which invited arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and rendered the ordinance unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The &quot;specific intent&quot; addition did not clearly specify what conduct an individual has the specific intent to engage in and failed to provide guidance as to how a citizen was to determine whether the area was known to the officer as a &quot;high drug activity geographic area.&quot; Further, allowing officers, judges, and juries to consider the enumerated circumstances in revised Akron, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 138.26(B) swept within the prohibitions of the ordinance many things that may not be constitutionally punished under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Accordingly, the revised ordinance was impermissibly overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's sentencing entry stated that it considered the purposes and principles of sentencing under R.C. 2929.11 and balanced the seriousness and recidivism factors under R.C. 2929.12. Defendant's sole assignment of error was whether the trial court erred in imposing a maximum sentence. The appellate court affirmed. The trial court had full discretion to sentence within the statutory range, and a mention of factors that were required pre-Foster would not be erroneous because the trial court could consider any factors it wanted to in sentencing. In defendant's case, the transcript did not reflect any mention of any previously required factors. While not properly preserved, defendant's ex post facto and due process claims also failed. The Foster remedy was not unconstitutionally retroactive. The sentencing statutes created, at most, a presumption of minimum, concurrent sentences. The presumption was not guaranteed, and therefore, there was no vested right to a minimum sentence. The state supreme court mandated the retroactive application of Foster to cases pending on direct review. The appellate court was bound by that mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which denied his motion to dismiss. Defendant was convicted of domestic violence and resisting arrest, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2919.25(A) and 2921.33(A), respectively. Two other counts against defendant were dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from an incident involving his girlfriend, with whom defendant resided. Defendant entered not guilty pleas and sought dismissal of the charges. In support of dismissal, defendant claimed that the charged offenses were unconstitutional as applied to him pursuant to the Marriage Protection Amendment (MPA), Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11. Although it was not specified, the motion to dismiss was apparently based on the domestic violence count. The trial court denied dismissal and defendant entered guilty pleas to two charges. The trial court held that the domestic violence statute was constitutional, and it imposed sentence on defendant. On appeal, the court found that the victim was within the coverage of a &quot;family or household member&quot; under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.25(A)-(C). The court agreed that the statute was constitutional, in that the intent and purpose of the domestic violence statute was not altered by the language of the MPA. Each legislative enactment had a different purpose and protected a separate right. Accordingly, defendant did not meet his stringent burden of proving that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that defendant failed to satisfy his burden of establishing unconstitutionality. The common and ordinary meaning of &quot;actively participates in a criminal gang&quot; was involvement with a criminal gang that was more than nominal or passive. Further, for defendant to be criminally liable under &sect; 2923.42(A), he also had to be criminally liable as an aider or abettor to a crime committed by a fellow gang member or members. Accordingly, &quot;purposely promoted, furthered, or assisted any criminal conduct&quot; was not void for vagueness and was well-defined under Ohio law. Also, &sect; 2923.42(A) did not unconstitutionally criminalize membership in an organization because the statute did not impermissibly establish guilt by association alone and the right to association, as guaranteed by the United States and Ohio Constitutions, did not provide protection to those organizations that commit a felony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the child was adjudicated abused and neglected, by her natural father, appellee paternal grandparents were granted temporary custody. Appellee children's services agency filed a motion for legal custody on behalf of the grandparents.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother challenged the constitutionality of R.C. 2151.353(A)(3). The appellate court held that the mother failed to demonstrate that R.C. 2151.353(A)(3) was unconstitutional as she failed to show that it violated due process requirements. The trial court properly applied the best interest of the child standard, set forth in R.C. 3109.04(F), and found that it was in the child's best interest to grant the grandparents legal custody of the child and to allow the mother visitation. The trial court was not required to find the mother unsuitable before making that disposition as the previous adjudication of the child as abused and dependent implicitly involved a finding of the mother's unsuitability. Further, granting legal custody of the child to the grandparents was in the child's best interest. The trial court thoroughly considered both the beneficial and detrimental aspects of placing the child with either party in making its best interest determination. It found that it was in her best interest to be placed in a stable environment with parental figures who could provide and model appropriate behavior, and understand her psychological needs resulting from her abuse by her father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio sought review of a decision from the Richland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted judgment to appellee inmate in his action under R.C. 2950.031(E) and 2950.032(E), contesting his sex offender reclassification. The trial court held that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008), was unconstitutional facially and as applied to the inmate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate received notification that his sex offender status was being reclassified. He filed his petition to contest the level of his classification and the application of the Adam Walsh Act pursuant to &sect;&sect; 2950.031(E) and 2950.032(E). It was noted that R.C. 2950.01 et seq., as amended by S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008), was not in effect when the inmate committed the sexual offenses, although it was in effect on the date that he was reclassified. The trial court held that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional facially and as applied to the inmate. The State appealed, and the matter was stayed pending resolution of a pending matter that raised the same issues. In the pending matter, the court found that S.B. 10 was constitutional and withstood challenges based on ex post facto laws, the right to contract, the separation of powers doctrine, double jeopardy, and substantive and procedural due process. Accordingly, the court determined that the inmate's constitutional challenges lacked merit. The court noted that the Adam Walsh Act withstood challenge in virtually every appellate district court in Ohio.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the city. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the city because the zoning as it pertained to the company's property was not unconstitutional. The company's property was not singled out to a more restrictive use, but was given a more restrictive use given the entire area. When viewed in light of the general purposes clauses of the two zoning classifications, the distinction was reasonable. Those included in a CG (commercial general district) that are not in a CN (commercial neighborhood district) create high volumes of customer traffic and have a higher impact on adjacent uses. Therefore, the delineation between the two classifications was reasonable and not arbitrary and did have a relation to the public safety and health. Further, there was no violation of equal protection because the city set forth a legitimate governmental interest in the two, albeit similar, zoning classifications. There was also no convincing evidence that the company's property and the property it used for comparison were similarly situated properties.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4123.56 violated the worker's right to equal protection of law in specifying a cap on benefits based on the state-wide average weekly wage. The worker appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker alleged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.56 was unconstitutional insofar as it placed a cap on disability benefits. Applying the rational basis test, the trial court determined that defendants identified a legitimate purpose for establishing a wage cap for the payment of compensation. The appellate court held that the workers' compensation legislation could survive constitutional scrutiny under the federal and Ohio equal protection clauses if the statute was rationally related to the accomplishment of some state objective at least as important as the purpose contained in the Constitution. A statute had to be upheld against an equal protection challenge if there was any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification. The appellate court found that in Ohio, workers' compensation was designed to provide sustenance benefits only. By including a wage cap in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.56, the appellate court held that the legislature promoted actuarial soundness and balance, while at the same time directing the sustenance-level benefits to those who most needed it. Thus, there was a rational basis for the wage cap.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The SOO entered a guilty plea to gross sexual imposition against a child, in violation of R.C. 2907.05, which was a third-degree felony and a sexually oriented offense based on R.C. 2950.01(D). He was convicted, sentenced to community control, and classified as a sexual predator under R.C. 2950.09. The SOO was not registration-exempt under R.C. 2950.04. After the enactment of R.C. 2950.031, the PA filed his injunctive relief action. It was noted that the SOO originally lived in his parents' home, and after being notified that he had to relocate pursuant to &sect; 2950.031, he rented a residence two doors down, which was still within the prohibited range. The trial court granted summary judgment to the PA, finding that &sect; 2950.031 was not unconstitutionally retroactive in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 as applied to the SOO. On appeal, the court noted that the language of R.C. 2950.031 was meant to be retroactive under R.C. 1.48, and that it expressly applied to the SOO's rental of premises after the effective date of &sect; 2950.031.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that R.C. 2107.24 was not retroactive in either its application or effect as it was a remedial, curative law such as was recognized by Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. Section 2107.24 provided the cure of a defect in the decedent's will arising out of its improper execution. As the right of succession was created by legislative enactment, the terms of that succession could be modified by legislative enactment. The application of &sect; 2107.24 did not retroactively divest the sister of any interest in the decedent's estate. The statute was enacted before the decedent died, and before the vesting of any potential interest in his estate. As the admission of the decedent's purported will to probate under &sect; 2107.24 related back to the date of the decedent's death, the sister acquired no interest in the estate upon the decedent's death. The decedent was not intestate until the admission of the purported will. The sister did not have standing to raise an impairment of contracts claim. The application of &sect; 2107.24 to admit the document to probate was a prospective application since the decedent died after the law took effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a decision from the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which classified him as a sexual predator pursuant to R.C. 2950.09(C). The inmate had been previously convicted of rape without an age specification, in violation of R.C. 2907.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was indicted on three counts each of rape and felonious assault. He entered a guilty plea to one count of rape in exchange for the State's entry of a nolle prosequi as to the other charges. The trial court imposed an indefinite term of imprisonment on the inmate. Four years later, a sex offender classification hearing pursuant to H.B. 180, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) was held, after which the trial court classified the inmate as a sexual predator pursuant to &sect; 2950.09(C). On appeal, the court rejected the inmate's claim that S.B. 5, Gen. Assem. (Ohio), was unconstitutional as applied to him, although his criminal conduct and conviction occurred before the effective date. The legislation was not violative of either Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 or U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. However, the court found that the evidence was insufficient to support the sexual predator classification where there was only argument by counsel for the State. There were no fact witnesses, expert testimony, or psychological evaluations. Further, the inmate claimed that he successfully completed sex offender treatment programs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court with respect to the inmate's classification as a sexual predator. The matter was remanded to the trial court with instructions to vacate the sexual predator classification, and to enter a finding that the inmate was a sexually oriented offender. The remainder of the trial court decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court adjudged him to be delinquent and ordered that the commitments be served consecutively. Neither the juvenile nor his counsel objected to the consecutive commitments.

Consequently, the juvenile claimed that &sect; 2152.17(F) violated the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The appellate court was troubled that neither the juvenile nor his family would be provided with some sort of explanation for the juvenile court's imposition of consecutive commitments. However, it did not have to address the asserted unconstitutionality of &sect; 2152.17(F) because the juvenile failed to raise the issue before the trial court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review of a judgment from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, which overruled the father's objections to a magistrate's determination, and entered an order that, inter alia, granted visitation to the maternal grandmother of the father's two children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced, and the mother was thereafter killed as a result of an automobile accident. The maternal grandmother (MG) sought enforcement of her visitation rights with respect to the parties' two children. The father sought dismissal, but the magistrate awarded temporary visitation. The father then stopped the visitation, and the MG filed numerous contempt motions. The father again sought dismissal. The magistrate granted the MG visitation, overruled the motions to dismiss, and found the father in contempt, and those determinations were adopted by the trial court. Thereafter, the MG sought, inter alia, reallocation of custodial rights and responsibilities. The trial court denied the father's objections to the magistrate's determinations. On appeal, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3109.11 and 3109.051(D) were not violative of the father's constitutional rights. It found the statutes narrowly tailored, and that they allowed the trial court to afford &quot;special weight&quot; to the father's opinion on the issue, as well as allowing the trial court to consider the best interests of the children. There was support for the magistrate's determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant job and family services agency revoked plaintiff home day care provider's certification to operate a type B day-care home because her criminal history made her noncompliant with R.C. 5104.09(A)(1)(b) and Ohio Admin. Code 5101:2-14. An administrative hearing officer affirmed the agency's decision to revoke the certification. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) affirmed the revocation. The provider appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The day care provider argued that the agency erred by retroactively applying R.C. 5104.09 (2005). The appellate court held that, because the provider had pled guilty to forgery prior the effective amendment date of R.C. 5104.09 (2005), the administrative hearing officer correctly found that the statutory amendment applied retroactively to her, in accordance with the legislature's intent. Although the trial court erroneously found that the challenged amendment operated prospectively only, the error was harmless. The provider was not prejudiced when the agency applied R.C. 5104.09(D) retroactively because its retroactive application was in accordance with the law. The provider acquired no &quot;vested right&quot; to own or operate a type B family day-care home. Further, in light of the overriding purpose of the child care legislation to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of children receiving child care, and the governmental interest in preventing fraud in publicly funded day-care operations, the administrative rule at issue was reasonable in preventing the provider, a past felony offender convicted of forgery, from owning or operating a publicly funded day-care home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a sexually oriented offender under the regulatory scheme in effect when the registrant was sentenced, the registrant was subject to a ten-year duty of registration upon his release from prison and to annual verification of this registration, but he was not subject to community notification. However, under the new registration system of Ohio's Adam Walsh Act, R.C. Chapter 2950, he was a Tier III offender, was to register for the rest of his life, and was subject to community notification. The court found that to the extent that the registration requirements in the Act changed the frequency or duration of the registration requirements, it did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 regarding retroactive laws. However, to the extent that any provision of the Act changed the form or content of the registration requirements, it did violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 regarding retroactive laws. Moreover, the additional registration requirements beyond frequency and duration were clearly punitive in their effect and violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U. S. Constitution. Finally, the sex-offender-classification system did not run afoul of the separation-of-powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

He was adjudicated a sexually oriented offender. Subsequently, he was notified of his new classification and registration duties based on Ohio's Adam Walsh Act, R.C. Chapter 2950, as a Tier II offender. He filed a petition to contest the reclassification. The Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied the petition. The sex offender appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sex offender argued that his reclassification as a Tier II sex offender under the Adam Walsh Act was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the sex offender's reclassification was constitutional. There was no abrogation of his prior adjudication because the registration and notification scheme of the new legislation was not punitive in nature, but rather civil and remedial. Thus, there was no violation of the separation of powers. Because it was civil in nature and not punitive in intent or effect, it was also not an ex post facto law or a retroactive law. Further, application of the new sexual offender provisions did not constitute a second punishment prohibited by the double jeopardy provision, in violation of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Additionally, the record did not show that the sex offender had suffered an actual injury from any residency restrictions imposed by S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio). Finally, because the registration and notification requirements were merely remedial conditions imposed after release from prison and not additional punishment, they did not affect any plea agreement previously entered into.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases, appellees cities sought declarations that R.C. 9.481 was unconstitutional. In one case, appellants unions sought a declaration that the statute prevailed over a contradictory city ordinance. Each trial court ruled against the cities, but the Court of Appeals for Allen County (Ohio) and the Court of Appeals for Summit County (Ohio) reversed. The unions and appellant, the State of Ohio, sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cities, in Akron, Ohio, Charter &sect;&sect; 105a and 106(5b) and Lima, Ohio, Ordinance 201-00, required their employees to live in the respective cities, but R.C. 9.481 barred political subdivisions from imposing such requirements. The trial courts said the statute was a valid exercise of the legislature's authority pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34, but the courts of appeal disagreed. The supreme court agreed with the trial courts and held the statute was enacted pursuant to &sect; 34 and prevailed over the conflicting local laws, despite the cities' home rule authority in Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, because no other provision of the Ohio Constitution could &quot;limit or impair&quot; laws enacted pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34. R.C. 9.481 provided for the comfort and general welfare of employees by allowing them more freedom of choice of residency, so it was validly enacted pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34. Thus, even if the conflicting local laws were enacted pursuant to the cities' home rule authority, they were still invalid because no provision of the Constitution could &quot;impair or limit&quot; the general assembly's ability to enact laws pursuant to &sect; 34.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 5739.101 was of a general nature, as its subject matter was an excise tax. In addition, although there were only three areas in the state that currently qualified for resort-area status under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.101(A)(1), there were no limitations or restrictions to prevent other municipal corporations or townships from qualifying in the future. The terms of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.101 were uniformly applicable to all qualifying municipal corporations or townships in the state and to all the vendors therein. Because it was possible for any municipality or township throughout the state to become a resort area in the future, given a sufficient change in circumstances, the state supreme court held that the resort-area legislation was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted defendant of two counts of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02, and sentenced him to eight years in prison and classified him as a Tier III sexual offender. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his sentence was contrary to law. The appellate court held that the constitutionality of the consecutive-sentencing provisions were not applicable because defendant was ordered to serve concurrent prison terms. Further, his sentence was not contrary to law, nor did it constitute an abuse of discretion. The eight-year sentences were clearly within the applicable statutory range, pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(A)(1). Also, the trial court considered the necessary statutes in reaching its sentence. The trial court's entry that it had carefully considered R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12 was sufficient to establish compliance with its duty. Finally, defendant offered no evidence to rebut the presumption that the jury followed the trial court's instructions not to discuss the case and not to form an opinion over the weekend after receiving all of the evidence. Consequently, it had to be presumed that the jury did in fact follow the trial court's admonition.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, it held that &sect; 2745.01 was constitutional, as it had been &quot;duly enacted.&quot; Further, the trial court found that appellants failed to set forth evidence to show that the employer acted with a deliberate intent to injure the employee, and as such, it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law pursuant to &sect; 2745.01. On appeal of only the constitutionality determination, the court found that &sect; 2745.01 was not constitutional under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 34 and 35. It represented an invalid exercise of legislative authority because it attempted to legislate employer intentional torts that occurred within the employment relationship. However, such intentional tortious conduct always occurred outside of that relationship. The outcome of &sect; 2745.01 was the same as prior legislation that had been struck down in that it immunized employers from liability for their intentional tortious conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator's decedent was killed while riding in a car operated by the driver. Upon review, the appellate court upheld the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendants. The language in the policy could not be read to conclude that the $ 25,000 limit was available to any claimant separately. Rather, the language at issue clearly consolidated all claims into a single claim. The trial court did not err in so concluding. Former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18(H) did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by usurping the judicial authority conferred upon Ohio courts.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18(H), as amended by Am. Sub. S.B. 20 (Ohio), was the uninsured/underinsured automobile liability policy counterpart to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.44. They both purported, in essence, to allow liability policies to consolidate all claims into a single claim. Because it had already been determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.44 did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19a, the appellate court felt compelled to follow the ruling in regard to former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18(H), at least until the Ohio Supreme Court determined otherwise.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 10 because (1) it sought to protect public safety, (2) it imposed no new affirmative disability or restraint, its registration requirements had a remedial purpose, and public access to information on offenders prevailed over any detriment from releasing the information, (3) it did not promote retribution or deterrence as it sought no vengeance and, by itself, was no deterrent, (4) punishment for a failure to register was not applied retroactively for a prior act, but for a violation after the law's enactment, and (5) it was narrowly tailored to the danger sex offenders posed to the public and was not excessive as to that purpose. The general assembly presumably knew of this decision when enacting S.B. 10, and S.B. 10 would not be viewed differently because its changes did not show the prior decision was no longer controlling or that S.B. 10 made Ohio's sexual offender classification system punitive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators, unions and individual asbestos litigants, filed an action against respondent court of common pleas, challenging the constitutionality of Am. Sub. H.B. 292, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2004), also known as the Asbestos Litigation Bill (ALB). Relators requested the issuance of writs of mandamus, prohibition, and procedendo with respect to pending or accrued claims. Various motions were pending.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators claimed that the ALB prevented plaintiffs from prosecuting claims and that it was unconstitutional. They sought issuance of various writs with respect to pending claims and claims that accrued prior to the ALB becoming effective. Intervention was allowed to various parties, and numerous motions were pending. The court did not reach the constitutional issues raised due to procedural determinations, wherein it held that the original actions in mandamus, prohibition, and procedendo were not the appropriate remedy for relators to assert their constitutional claims. The unions lacked standing to prosecute the action, as they were not within the public action standing exception due to the limited scope of the ALB, and they had no personal or private right to secure judicial review. As the actual relief sought was a declaratory judgment and a prohibitory injunction, mandamus was not appropriate. Further, claims were not stated under each of the extraordinary writ claims. There was an adequate remedy at law to all relators by way of a declaratory judgment action, and the litigants also could seek judicial review pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2505.02(B)(4) and 2505.03(A).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied relators' motion for summary judgment, granted the dispositive motions of respondent and the intervenors, and sua sponte vacated the entry that granted the motion to intervene of one party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender argued that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008) was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (AWA), R.C. Chapter 2950, did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause or the retroactivity clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 because the registration and notification requirements remained civil and nonpunitive in nature after the amendments enacted by S.B. 10. Public safety was the driving force behind the AWA. The AWA also did not violate the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment or double jeopardy. However, application of the AWA to the offender violated the doctrine of separation of powers. The offender's classification as a sexually oriented offender, with definite registration requirements, constituted a final order of the trial court. Therefore, no court could be statutorily directed or required to modify the prior judgment provisions concerning his notification and registration requirements without violating separation of powers and res judicata principles. Final judgments could not be legislatively annulled or modified in situations where the legislature had enacted new legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio sought review of a judgment from the Richland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which held that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008), was unconstitutional both facially and as applied to appellee inmate. The inmate was convicted of rape and kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2907.02 and 2905.01. The matter arose in the inmate's challenge to his sexual offender reclassification pursuant to R.C. 2950.031(E) and 2950.032(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of rape and kidnapping with a sexual motivation specification, and he was originally classified as a sexual predator. Thereafter, he was notified that pursuant to the Adam Walsh Act (AWA) and R.C. 2950.01 et seq., as amended by S.B. 10, he was reclassified as a Tier III sex offender. The inmate filed a petition to contest the reclassification, wherein he challenged the classification and the application of the AWA to him. The trial court relied on another case holding in determining that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional because it violated the prohibitions against retroactive and ex post facto laws. Accordingly, judgment was entered in favor of the inmate. On appeal, the matter was stayed pending disposition of the appeal in the precedential case. That case resulted in a reversal of the unconstitutionality holding. Upon lifting of the stay, the court relied on the appellate decision in the precedential case to find that the trial court decision was in error. Rather, S.B. 10 survived constitutional challenge on a number of issues. The right to contract under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 was not implicated, as there was no plea agreement in the inmate's matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city filed a declaratory action against appellees, the State of Ohio and others, challenging the constitutionality of R.C. 9.481. In a separate action, the city's police and firefighter unions sought a declaration that R.C. 9.481 was constitutional. The Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) held that R.C. 9.481 was constitutional and invalidated the city's employee residency requirements. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment for the State and the unions. The appellate court held that the trial court erred when it concluded that the Ohio General Assembly's enactment of R.C. 9.481 was within its authority under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34 to pass laws providing for the &quot;general welfare&quot; of employees. Laws passed for the &quot;general welfare&quot; of employees did not encompass a single-issue statute that sought to reinstate a non-fundamental right that the employees voluntarily surrendered when they accepted employment. The sole purpose of was to invalidate employee residency requirements by political subdivisions. That legislation did not address any significant social issues impacting the public at large; it was not part of a comprehensive legislative scheme, but dealt with a single issue; and it applied to a relatively small segment of the population. Finally, R.C. 9.481 was an attempt by the Ohio General Assembly to circumvent the home rule authority of municipalities, under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, to maintain residency requirements for their employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee executrix sued appellants alleged suppliers of asbestos-containing products in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, strict liability, breach of warranty, fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation, products liability, and conspiracy, before 2003 Am. Sub. H.B. 292 (H.B. 292) was effective. The trial court held H.B. 292 unconstitutional, as applied, and the suppliers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found H.B. 292 violated Ohio's constitutional ban on retroactive legislation in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The appellate court held it was error for the trial court to find H.B. 292's definition of &quot;competent medical authority,&quot; codified in R.C. 2307.91(Z), could not be retroactively applied because the Ohio Supreme Court found that it was not substantive, since it was procedural in nature, as it pertained to a witness's competency to testify. It was error to find that H.B. 292's definition of &quot;substantial contributing factor,&quot; codified in R.C. 2307.91(FF), could not be retroactively applied because the Ohio Supreme Court held the definition reflected the common-law requirement that asbestos exposure be both a cause in fact and a direct cause of the executrix's decedent's illness and was consistent with the concept of dual causation. It was error to find that the definition of substantial occupational exposure, in R.C. 2307.91(GG), could not be retroactively applied because the Ohio Supreme Court held that it was not a legislative attempt to adopt the Lohrmann test, which the Supreme Court had previously rejected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the trial court was required to apply H.B. 292 and administratively dismiss the executrix's claim without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

It did not offend bars against double jeopardy because it imposed no punishment. He showed no standing to contest its residency restrictions since he did not claim they had an impact on him. It did not violate separation of powers by letting the Attorney General impose punishment because it was remedial, and its registration and notification requirements were collateral consequences of a criminal conviction, nor did its reclassification provisions give the Attorney General appellate review, and classifying sex offenders was a legislative mandate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city and the Ohio Attorney General, as intervenor, sought review of a judgment from the Bedford Municipal Court (Ohio), which declared R.C. 4506.161&nbsp;unconstitutional. The matter arose after defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, in violation of Solon, Ohio, Ordinance 434.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was cited for intoxicated driving violations under municipal ordinances. An administrative license suspension was imposed, but defendant was thereafter granted occupational driving privileges for when he drove a non-commercial vehicle pursuant to R.C. 4506.161. Defendant entered a no contest plea to the DUI charge. The trial court granted defendant's motion to declare &sect; 4506.161&nbsp;unconstitutional as violative of the single subject rule and equal protection. Defendant was restored to full driving privileges. On appeal, the court noted that the issue was repetitive yet capable of evading review, such that it was reviewable. The court held that under the plain language of &sect; 4506.161, it was applicable to suspensions of individual driver's licenses. Further, the trial court had jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to R.C. 4510.13(A)(6) and 4507.16(E). R.C. 4506.161, which was enacted within Am. Sub. H.B. 66, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2005), did not violate the single-subject rule of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D), as it had a sufficient common thread with the budget because it preserved federal funding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, an injured employee and his wife, filed a complaint alleging that respondent employers committed an employer intentional tort. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division, certified questions for review regarding the validity, under the Ohio Constitution, of Ohio's employer intentional-tort statute,&nbsp;R.C. 2745.01, as enacted by Am. H.B. 498, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2005), 150 Ohio Laws, Pt. IV, 5533.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing the certified questions, the Supreme Court of Ohio determined that R.C. 2745.01 did not violate the Ohio Constitution's trial-by-jury provision of Ohio Const. art.

I, &sect; 16, the equal protection provision of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, or the separation-of-powers doctrine, and was therefore constitutional on its face. Further, R.C. 2745.01 did not conflict with the legislative authority granted to the Ohio General Assembly by Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 34 and 35.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Ashland County Municipal Court (Ohio) denied defendant's motion to suppress and to dismiss, he was convicted on a jury verdict of unlawfully possessing two loaded firearms in a motor vehicle (Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.16(B)), and unlawfully interfering with a wildlife officer in the performance of his duties (Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.67). One of the firearms involved was ordered forfeited to the State. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A wildlife officer entered defendant's property and said he needed to look in defendant's truck to investigate possible gaming violations. Defendant told him he had a rifle in the truck, but his insistence that the officer needed a search warrant to search the truck resulted in his arrest for interference with an officer. The officer found a loaded shotgun and loaded .22 rifle in the truck. The appellate court held that the officer was authorized by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1531.14 to approach the truck, and when he saw, in plain view, a shotgun with a closed action, its illegality was immediately apparent because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.16(C)(4) required that a weapon carried in a motor vehicle have the action open. Therefore, the officer's warrantless search was proper under the plain view doctrine. Defendant failed to prove the unconstitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1531.14 on its face or as applied. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.41(C)(1) permitted the trial court to order the forfeiture of property used in the commission of an offense; as carrying a loaded .22 rifle was the basis of a charge on which defendant was convicted, the trial court properly ordered its forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant union sued appellees school board, financial planning and supervision commission, Ohio Department of Education, Superintendent of Public Instruction, and Ohio State Auditor in the Columbiana County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) to declare R.C. Chapter 3316&nbsp;unconstitutional, and sought to void the Auditor's declaration of a fiscal emergency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission, appointed to manage the district's finances when the State Auditor declared a fiscal emergency, laid off union members. The appellate court held the union had no standing to contest the Auditor's finding because, statutorily, only the board of education could. R.C. Chapter 3316 did not unconstitutionally usurp the school board's authority because it was elected, as the Ohio Constitution provided, after which the commission only assumed its fiscal duties in a fiscal emergency. This different treatment of a fiscally troubled district did not offend equal protection because there was no right to an elected school board, so any classification was subject to a rational basis review, and several rational bases existed to treat the district differently. It was no error to grant judgment on the pleadings on a claimed violation of the right to enter into contracts because the statute allowing the commission's appointment was enacted before the members' current contract's execution, so it was not subsequent legislation impairing contract rights. The union had no standing to contest the district's failure to file a statutorily required plan to address the fiscal emergency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Campaign materials that depicted the chairman as the sender and that indicated that the party paid for the material were sent to Ohio voters, urging them to vote by mail for party candidates running for statewide offices.

It determined that the chairman violated &sect; 3517.21(B)(1) but that the violation itself was a sufficient penalty. On appeal, the trial court held that &sect; 3517.21(B)(1) was constitutional on its face. It further held that the chairman and the party had knowledge of the implied claim of incumbency represented by the candidate pictures. On further review, the court found no merit to claims that &sect; 3517.21(B)(1) was unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. Further, &sect; 3517.21(B)(1) was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, and it was not unconstitutionally applied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council adopted an ordinance which regulated public bench signs.

The city sought a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of Canton, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 110-2202, which was an amended ordinance. The trial court found that the ordinance was valid and constitutional as applied to the partners, and that no taking had occurred. On appeal, the court found that the partners had no vested right in the permits. Accordingly, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.15 was inapplicable. The bench signs were a nuisance, as they created a safety hazard and impeded sidewalk access. There was no substantive due process violation and there was no taking under Ohio Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle was stopped for an expired license plate.

In affirming, the appellate court determined that the questions posed by a trial court for the purpose of clarifying material facts did not amount to improper examination. Although the trial court erred by finding that U.S. Const. amend. II was inapplicable to laws enacted by the State of Ohio, there was no violation of the right to bear arms. Moreover, R.C. 2923.16(B) did not constitutionally infringe upon a right to bear arms under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 4. An equal protection argument under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers who were investigating alleged teenage criminal gang activity determined that several individuals were members of a particular gang. Defendant was one of those individuals, and the officers observed him and other members of the gang participate in numerous drug transactions. At the time of defendant's arrest, he was wearing a belt with the gang name on the belt buckle, and his cell phone screen displayed the same phrase. A search of defendant's home pursuant to a warrant revealed several notebooks with writings that mentioned the gang name and drug sales. Defendant was found guilty of the charged crime after a jury trial, and he was sentenced. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 2923.42 was not unconstitutionally vague in violation of the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. R.C. &sect; 2923.42, when viewed with the definitions in R.C. &sect; 2923.41, clearly defined for ordinary citizens as well as officials who enforced the law the conduct that was prohibited.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of rape upon his guilty plea. Thereafter, a hearing was held pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The trial court denied that motion. On appeal, the court determined that appellant did not show that granting his motion was necessary to avoid a manifest injustice. The court further held that the statute did not violate a convicted sex offender's right to privacy, right to acquire or protect property, or right to a favorable reputation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio appealed a judgment from the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which dismissed a charge of domestic violence against defendant, in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 11 went into effect, the trial court analyzed Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.25 with respect to a charge of domestic violence against defendant involving an unmarried spouse. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charge in part, finding that &sect; 2919.25 was unconstitutional to the extent that it was incompatible with Issue 1. The trial court dismissed the domestic violence charge against defendant and amended the indictment to the lesser included charge of assault. The State appealed as of right. The court found that &sect; 2919.25 was neither incompatible with, nor unconstitutional in light of, Issue 1. There was a reasonable interpretation that allowed both legislative enactments to stand and co-exist. The court concluded that Ohio's domestic violence statute was not a right to be free from family violence that arose from the legal status of marriage, nor was it a crime that was born out of marriage alone. Rather, it involved the theshold factual determination of who was a &quot;family or household member,&quot; which determination was not dependent on the legal definition of marriage, but instead, on whether the parties resided together.</SPAN></P>

The court limited its discussion to whether the statute was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. The practical application of the statute as applied to defendant precluded him from filing a motion for judicial release because he would not have served his prison term completely before he would be permitted to file a motion. Likewise, the trial judge had no opportunity to modify the sentence based upon changed circumstances. The purpose of the statute, as applied to defendant, did not withstand equal protection scrutiny under a rational basis analysis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio appealed a decision from the Richland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which held that S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2008) was unconstitutional both facially and as applied to appellee inmate. The inmate was convicted of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02. The matter arose in the inmate's challenge to his sexual offender reclassification pursuant to R.C. 2950.031(E) and 2950.032(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of two counts of rape, and he was originally classified as a sexual predator. Thereafter, he was notified that pursuant to the Adam Walsh Act (AWA) and R.C. 2950.01 et seq., as amended by S.B. 10, he was reclassified as a Tier III sex offender. The inmate filed a petition to contest the reclassification, wherein he challenged the classification and the application of the AWA to him. The trial court relied on another case holding in determining that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional because it violated the prohibitions against retroactive and ex post facto laws. Accordingly, judgment was entered in favor of the inmate. On appeal, the matter was stayed pending disposition of the appeal in the precedential case. That case resulted in a reversal of the unconstitutionality holding. Upon lifting of the stay, the court relied on the appellate decision in the precedential case to find that the trial court decision was in error. Rather, S.B. 10 survived constitutional challenge on a number of issues, including the right to contract under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held this was error because the statute did not involve an unreviewable, unilateral determination that an animal was &quot;vicious or dangerous.&quot; Rather, the State had to prove this at trial as an element of the offense, and the dog's owner had a chance to contest that allegation. The statute did not create additional obligations on defendant based upon a unilateral and unreviewable finding of viciousness or dangerousness. Defendant was afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard and could contest the allegation that his dog was vicious or dangerous. Defendant could be found guilty only if the State proved all elements of the offense, including the dangerousness or viciousness element, beyond a reasonable doubt, so all due process protections normally associated with a criminal trial were available to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Common Pleas of Perry County, No. 22043.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In DeRolph v. State (1997), 78 Ohio St. 3d 193, 677 N.E.2d 733 (&quot;DeRolph I&quot;), at the syllabus, this court determined that &quot;Ohio's elementary and secondary public school financing system violates Section 2, Article VI of the Ohio Constitution, which mandates a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state.&quot; For the background and procedural history of the events that led up to that opinion, see 78 Ohio St. 3d at 193-195, 677 N.E.2d at 734-735.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In DeRolph I, this court recognized that a new funding system could not be crafted and implemented without time and deliberation. Therefore, we stayed the effect of our decision for twelve months, id. at 213, 677 N.E.2d at 747, in order to give the General Assembly time to enact remedial legislation. We remanded the cause to the trial court, ordering the trial court to &quot;retain jurisdiction until the legislation is enacted and in effect, taking such action as may be necessary to ensure conformity with this opinion.&quot; Id.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In entries issued after that decision, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this court expounded on its order of remand to the trial court. In particular, in response to a request from the defendants for clarification and reconsideration of the decision, this court stated that local property taxes could be part of the revised funding plan, but property taxes could not be the primary means of funding a thorough and efficient system of schools.  78 Ohio St. 3d 419, 678 N.E.2d 886, 887. Furthermore, this court stated that, consistent with the DeRolph I decision, upon remand to the trial court the parties could present evidence regarding the enacted remedy, to establish whether the remedy satisfied the Thorough and Efficient Clause of the Ohio Constitution. 78 Ohio St. 3d at 420-421, 678 N.E.2d at 887-888. The parties could then appeal the trial court's ruling directly to this court, for final determination.  Id. at 421, 678 Ohio St. 3d at 888.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From August 24, 1998, through September 3, 1998, the trial court held a hearing on the General Assembly's efforts in the wake of DeRolph I to create a new funding method. Plaintiffs, who continued to assert that Ohio's system of funding public education is unconstitutional, are essentially&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the same plaintiffs who pressed that position in DeRolph I. The defendants argued that the revised system complies with the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Perry County that the Ohio General Assembly's recent reworking of the laws governing Ohio's public school financing system still left the State with an unconstitutional public school financing scheme.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the trial court's determination that the Ohio General Assembly (legislature) had failed to show that it had systematically overhauled Ohio's school funding system to pass constitutional muster. Specifically, it found fault with the methods used to measure the equity of district funding, because the legislature had departed from its expert consultant's measuring standards without explanation for its departure. Local property taxes still accounted for the majority of school funding, contrary to court mandate. The measures passed for construction of new facilities and maintenance of existing facilities was inadequate to correct the existing $ 16.5 billion deficit, and made no account for forthcoming maintenance needs. The legislature passed academic standards accountability statutes without passing the necessary appropriations bills to sustain them, in effect worsening the schools' financial positions. Voters did not approve a one-cent sales tax increase passed to increase funding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court affirmed trial court's judgment and extended time for State of Ohio General Assembly (legislature) to enact legislation to bring public school financing system within constitutional compliance, because court was unwilling to completely reject legislature's progress and because process was complex and required balancing of many factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court held that the Smoke Free Workplace Act is a valid exercise of the state's police power by Ohio's voters and does not constitute a taking of property. Appellants failed to establish that they would be subject to an unlawful policy of strict liability. Substantial evidence existed that appellants at least implicitly permitted smoking. A city health department investigator witnessed two people smoking at a bar and observed cigarette butts in plastic cups filled halfway with water. Another investigator found multiple bar patrons who were smoking and who were using partially filled plastic cups as ashtrays. Although one of the appellants was present at the time, the investigator did not witness him address any of the smoking patrons. A third investigator witnessed at least eight patrons smoking and using small plastic cups as ashtrays. Although appellants were required under R.C. 3794.06(B) to remove all ashtrays and other receptacles used for disposing of smoking materials, appellants were cited nine times for allowing ashtrays to be present. In eight of the violations, the investigator determined that the violation was intentional and doubled the fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officers saw defendant staggering on the sidewalk and cited him for disorderly intoxication. He was then arrested because he appeared unable to provide for his on safety and was at risk of harm if left to walk the streets. The appellate court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.26(A)(1), which permitted arrest of a person for the commission of a minor misdemeanor if the offender was unable to provide for his own safety, was not unconstitutional. Defendant failed to establish that the statute, which ensured citizens' safety, limited any constitutionally protected fundamental rights, either facially or in its application. Further, according to the officer, defendant was staggering, almost fell into the street, was unsteady when trying to stand in one place, and had other physical indicators that he was intoxicated. Accordingly, sufficient evidence was presented from which the trial court could find that defendant could not provide for his own safety and the arrest was lawful.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high school argued that the trial court erred in construing Riverside, Ohio, City Ordinance &sect; 1341.01, which required a building permit applicant to install sidewalks when the proposed addition totaled 25 percent or more of the existing &quot;square footage&quot; of the principal existing building. The trial court found that the term &quot;square footage&quot; was ambiguous and affirmed the BZA's interpretation of &quot;square footage&quot; to mean the building's footprint. The appellate court found no error in the trial court's conclusion that &quot;square footage&quot; was ambiguous as used in &sect; 1341.01. Rational arguments could have been made that the term could mean either the usable square footage or the footprint square footage. There was no evidence to support the high school's assertion that the trial court failed to consider the complete record, and consideration of other ordinances to construe &sect; 1341.01 was proper. The BZA and the trial court reasonably concluded that &quot;footprint square footage,&quot; rather than &quot;gross floor area,&quot; was the intended meaning.

The supreme court held the provisions did not violate substantive due process or equal protection because the State of Ohio and the City had a legitimate interest in protecting citizens from unsafe conditions caused by pit bulls, as substantial evidence showed they caused disproportionate danger to people, and the laws were rationally related to those interests when the dogs' owners had to obtain liability insurance and were barred from surgically silencing them, and, under the ordinance, the number of pit bulls per person or entity was limited. The provisions did not violate procedural due process because pit bulls were classified generally as vicious dogs, so there was no unilateral, case-by-case decision-making, so all pit bull owners knew that failure to abide by the laws related to pit bulls was a crime. The provisions were not void for vagueness, on the theory that one could not tell if one owned a pit bull, because the dogs' traits and commonly available information about dog breeds sufficiently informed owners whether they owned a pit bull.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff water treatment plant appealed the judgment of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) finding that the plant's wastewater was hauled waste and that the city municipal ordinance, prohibiting waste from outside the city, did not violate the Ohio Constitution. The city cross-appealed the finding that the city municipal ordinance violated the United States Constitution's Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city maintained a publicly owned treatment works (POTW). The plant intended to haul contaminated wastewater from industrial users within Ohio and surrounding states to the city's POTW. Then, the plant was to use the city's POTW facilities to discharge the wastewater after it was treated. The plant was required to obtain a permit to discharge into the city's POTW. The applications were denied based on Dayton, Ohio, Mun. Ordinance &sect; 52.06(B)(3), (4). The trial court erred in concluding that the wastewater the plant sought to discharge into the city's POTW was excluded by &sect; 52.06(B)(3), (4). The wastewater did not constitute hauled waste under &sect; 52.06(B)(3), (4). The trial court did not err in finding that &sect; 52.06(B)(3), (4), which prohibited discharge from outside the city's area, did not violate the Ohio Constitution.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6111 provided the city with an express grant of discretion when enacting local ordinances. Section 52.06(B)(3), (4) violated the dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The ordinance patently discriminated against interstate commerce, and there was no health or safety reason necessitating the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant proposed, on the internet, having sex with an officer he thought was a 14-year-old girl. The appellate court held registration requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2950.04 through 2950.06 were not unconstitutional as applied to sexually-oriented offenders because they rationally exercised the State's police powers. As defendant's intended victim was under 18, his crime was not presumptively registration-exempt, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(P)(1). Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.07(D)(2), prohibiting importuning, was not facially unconstitutional, as it was not void for vagueness. It clearly prohibited adults from using computers to solicit minors of certain ages, or law enforcement personnel posing as such minors, for sex. It barred conduct, not &quot;virtual&quot; child pornography, and was narrowly tailored to serve the government's compelling interest. It was not unjust to require the State only to prove defendant thought the person he communicated with was a minor. The First Amendment did not protect such conduct. As he stipulated that he thought the person he communicated with was 14, his conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the trial court had sufficient evidence to find by clear and convincing evidence that the children's best interests were served by placing them in the permanent custody of the agency to facilitate permanent placement for them. Because at the time that the agency filed its motion for permanent custody, the children had been in the agency's custody of for 12 months of a consecutive 22-month period, the trial court properly found that the requirement of R.C. &sect; 2151.414(B)(1)(d) was satisfied. Further, given the testimony of the children, coupled with the guardian ad litem's recommendation, the trial court had sufficient evidence to support its determination. It was clear from the record that since the agency became involved with the family, the parents had failed to establish a stable and safe home and income sufficient to meet the children's needs and failed to remedy the situation that caused the removal of the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.04. The trial court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 5 to 25 years. Appellant challenged his sentence, arguing because he was sentenced under pre-Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (Ohio) law, he was denied due process and equal protection of law as guaranteed by the United States Constitution on account of his potential to receive an increased length of sentence at the whim of the Ohio Parole Authority. He also argued under the present parole scheme it was not unrealistic to anticipate that he would serve every day of his 25-year maximum term, yet another defendant who committed the exact offense after the effective date of Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (Ohio) would only serve a maximum of 10 years. The court affirmed, holding Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (Ohio) was inapplicable to appellant's crime where it was committed prior to its effective date, and standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute required demonstration of concrete injury in fact, rather than an abstract or suspected injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a juvenile, appellant was adjudicated a delinquent by virtue of committing the crime of rape. Two years after he was found to be a habitual sex offender, he was sent a notice of new classification and registration duties, notifying that, pursuant to the Ohio Legislature's passage of S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio), implementing the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (AWA), he would be newly classified as a Tier III sex offender. The court held that, pursuant to R.C. 2950.11(F)(2), the trial court should have relieved appellant of the notification requirements because he was exempt from community notification under the AWA since he was not subject to community notification under the former statute. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of S.B. 10, finding that it did not violate ex post facto protections, the retroactivity clause of the Ohio Constitution, and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Ohio Constitution. S.B. 10 also did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers as the sex offender classification was a creation of the legislature, and therefore, the power to classify was properly expanded or limited by the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment insofar as it upheld the imposition of community notification; however, it affirmed the remainder of the trial court's judgment. The court remanded the matter for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment for the employer. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err by granting the employer's motion for summary judgment. R.C. 2745.01 did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 34 or 35 and was, thus, constitutional on its face. The flexibility of constitutional decision-making and stare decisis directly applied. Because the Ohio General Assembly's police power was plenary, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 34 or 35 did not render R.C. 2745.01&nbsp;unconstitutional since they did not place specific and clear limitations on the General Assembly's authority. Further, the trial court correctly found that the employee failed to raise genuine issues of material fact to sustain his burdens under R.C. 2745.01 because the evidence did not show that the employer intended to harm or deliberately injure the employee. The employee was experienced in working around paperboard machines and was aware of the dangers presented. He knew, through both the training policies and his own experience, to not go into a machine while its moving parts were still under power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and a writ of mandamus, alleging, among other things, that Ohio's gambling laws unconstitutionally created a monopoly.

The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted appellees' motion to dismiss. Appellants filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the trial court erred in concluding that each appellant lacked standing. The appellate court held that the trial court properly dismissed the case for failure to state a claim under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) because none of appellants had private standing because they had not suffered or were not threatened with any direct and concrete injury in a manner or degree different from that suffered by the public in general. Although two appellants argued that, due to the gambling addiction of one of them, they and their family had suffered, the complaint did not allege that the laws in question had caused the injury or that the relief requested would redress such injury. Further, the complaint did not allege any special interest in a special fund, nor did it challenge the administration of a special fund. Rather, the complaint challenged the fact that some Ohio industries were being taxed differently than others, which was not sufficient to confer standing because it failed to allege damage distinct from the damages suffered by the general public and failed to allege a special interest in a special fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into a plea bargain, wherein he pled guilty to two misdemeanor charges. The trial court imposed maximum terms of incarceration which were to run consecutively, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;2929.22(C).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented on appeal was whether a township was a necessary party to a declaratory-judgment action challenging an enactment of the General Assembly as violating the one-subject rule of the Ohio Constitution. The court found that although the town may have had a practical interest in the outcome of the landfill's declaratory-judgment action, a township had no legal interest in the General Assembly's authority to enact laws and therefore was not a necessary party to a declaratory-judgment action challenging legislation as violating the one-subject rule. Although the town's interest in its pending litigation with the landfill may have been practically affected by the landfill's declaratory-judgment action against the State, the town had no legal interest in the authority of the General Assembly to enact amendments to R.C. 303.211 and 519.211 as part of an appropriations bill, in violation of the one-subject rule of the Ohio Constitution. Therefore, the town was not a necessary party to the landfill's declaratory-judgment action.</SPAN></P>

In separate decisions, both courts found that several part-petitions were invalid. The appellate court held that (1) the provision of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was employed as a delivery driver for a business. Defendant was fueling a truck at the company property's fueling station when he realized that the gasoline-powered truck was being filled instead with diesel fuel. Upon this realization, he stopped fueling, and began draining the diesel fuel from the truck into a two-gallon bucket. He then used a 15-gallon trash can until all the diesel was drained. He placed the trash can of diesel fuel near the tanks at the company's fueling station. At some point during this draining process, some of the diesel fuel was spilled into a storm sewer drain near the company's fueling station. Eventually, the fuel was carried into a nearby creek or lake. Local postal employees noticed an unusual odor and a &quot;sheen&quot; on the water. Governmental agencies responded, and eventually traced the &quot;spill&quot; to the incident. After defendant was convicted of littering, the appellate court found that the trial court did not err in construing &quot;waste&quot; to include diesel fuel, notwithstanding the lack of its particularized inclusion in the various statutory lists.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged various aspects of R.C. ch. 3314 in their action, seeking declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief. The matter was bifurcated and only arguments addressing constitutional issues were determined. The trial court found that all of the constitutional claims asserted by appellants lacked merit and entered orders on pending motions accordingly. The court of appeals only agreed with the trial court's disposition regarding no impingement of Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect;&nbsp;3. It found issues of fact required further litigation as to other constitutional issues. On further review, the court initially noted that the CS system was enacted by the Ohio General Assembly at Am. Sub. H.B. 215, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 1997). The court found no violation of the Thorough and Efficient Clause, Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, as the ownership and standards of CSs were subject to state regulation, and the funding did not create an unconstitutional scheme under that or under Ohio Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 4 and 5. There was no violation of local citizens' rights of local educational self-determination by use of local tax dollars for CSs under Ohio Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals with respect to the finding of constitutionality of CSs under Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the trial court's judgment, the court noted that, three days before the trial court's judgment entry was file stamped, the Ohio Supreme Court held in State v. Foster that various provisions in Ohio's felony sentencing statutes violated the Sixth Amendment because the trial judge, not the jury, was required to make certain findings to impose any sentence above the minimum sentence set forth in the statute. The State conceded that the trial court's judgment entry of sentence violated the principles set forth in Foster and agreed that the case should be remanded for resentencing. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court could only impose, at most, a three-year prison term based on due process and ex post facto concerns. Since the trial court had not had an opportunity to resentence defendant in light of the analysis and holding of Foster, any appeal challenging the penalty imposed upon resentencing had to wait until the trial court actually imposed the sentence.</SPAN></P>

The excised portions removed only the presumptive and judicial findings that related to the findings necessary to increase the potential prison penalty. Those provisions were found unconstitutional under the Sixth Amendment. In the instant case, the sentence was based on these unconstitutional statutes.

The court found that the statute was constitutional. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that R.C. 9.481 violated the Home Rule Provision, Uniformity Clause, and Contract Clause of the Ohio Constitution. On appeal, the court found that R.C. 9.481 was constitutional under the Ohio General Welfare Clause, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34, and the Ohio Home Rule Provision, Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. Therefore, municipalities could not require their employees to reside in a particular municipality. Further, because R.C. 9.481 was a law of general nature and operated uniformly throughout the State of Ohio, it was constitutional under the Ohio Uniformity Clause, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. Furthermore, the city, as a political subdivision created by the Ohio General Assembly, could not assert any constitutional protections regarding due course of law, under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16, or due process of law, under the Fourteenth Amendment, against the State, its creator. Finally, R.C. 9.481 did not violate the Ohio Contracts Clause, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was released from prison after serving a sentence for corruption of a minor, and he was placed on post-release control pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.28. Appellant violated the conditions set forth by the parole authority. Consequently, appellant was ordered by the parole authority to complete an 18-month program at a volunteer facility. Appellant failed to comply with the program's requirements and, as a result, he was charged with escape. Thereafter, appellant filed a motion to dismiss the escape charge, arguing &sect; 2967.28 was unconstitutional because it violated the constitutional doctrines of separation of powers and due process. Motion was denied. Appellant was found guilty of escape. Judgment reversed. Section 2967.28 was unconstitutional under the separation-of-powers doctrine because it assigned quasi-judicial functions to the parole authority, a state agency. As appellant was not under &quot;detention,&quot; he did not, as a matter of law, violate the escape statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed. The state parole authority did not have the constitutional authority to perform the quasi-judicial functions of determining the duration of appellant's post-release control, setting the standard of behavior for appellant, determining when there had been a violation of set standard, and applying punishment for violation without judicial intervention.</SPAN></P>

The indictment alleged that appellant had engaged in sexual conduct with his girlfriend's 13-year-old daughter. Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pleaded guilty to six of those counts. The trial court concluded that appellant was a sexual predator, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(E). The statute was narrowly tailored to comport with the respective danger and recidivism levels of the different classifications of sex offenders. Also, because persons of ordinary intelligence were not left to guess at the meaning of the term sexual predator, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.

Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court concluded that although the legislation impacted the life of appellant, it addressed a legitimate governmental interest without a detrimental effect on appellant's constitutional rights. The court also determined that the appellant's sexual predator status was established by clear and convincing evidence in accordance with the criteria set forth in &sect; 2950.09(B)(2). The court found that the presentence information showed a history of criminal convictions involving underage females, including attempted rape of a 15 year old, as well as convictions for domestic violence, breaking and entering, and receiving stolen property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted and pursuant to a plea agreement, he entered a guilty plea to one charge in exchange for the State's dismissal of the other charges. His plea indicated that he understood the maximum term that could be imposed was 10 years' incarceration. The trial court sentenced defendant to the maximum term, which sentence was reversed and vacated on appeal under the authority of Foster. Upon remand for resentencing, a 10-year term was again imposed. On appeal, the court found that application of Foster did not violate federal notions of due process as established in Bouie and Rogers. Defendant was aware of the potential statutory sentence he faced, as he had notice that the Ohio sentencing statutes were subject to judicial scrutiny and he was unlikely to change his conduct in light of a sentencing change, given that his criminal conduct extended for over a year. The Foster holding did not create a substantively retroactive law and accordingly, it was not unconstitutional under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. As presumed sentences could be taken away, defendant had no vested right that was affected by Foster. Additionally, no accrued substantial right was affected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of murder, in violation of Ohio Rev.

Following the entry of judgment by the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the felony-murder rule, claiming the State had to prove a collateral felony, independent of the lethal act, to serve as the predicate offense for felony murder. In rejecting this argument, the appellate court found the State had proven the culpable-mental-state element by proving the intent of the predicate felony of felonious assault. Therefore, defendant was not denied due process. Defendant's challenge of the sufficiency and weight of the evidence was also rejected, as the State presented ample evidence that the victim's death was caused by trauma from at least three severe blows to her head, and not from a fall to the ground as defendant claimed. Defendant also claimed error in the rejection of certain of his self-defense evidence, in that the victim told a nurse that she planned to &quot;act crazy with the boys on the street&quot; so they would kill her. Although finding that two of the three reasons given by the trial court for rejecting the evidence were erroneous, the third reason, that the victim's statement was nearly two years old and was too far removed in time, provided an independent and proper basis for excluding the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city sued appellant State of Ohio and sought a declaratory judgment that R.C. 718.01(H)(11) was unconstitutional because it was preempted by 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 105 et seq., violated Ohio's one-subject rule, and violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Ohio entered summary judgment for the city and declared R.C. 718.01(H)(11)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment fell solidly within R.C. 2505.02 since the trial court's judgment, declaring R.C. 718.01(H)(11)&nbsp;unconstitutional, unquestionably affected a substantial right. By declaring R.C. 718.01(H)(11)&nbsp;unconstitutional based on the city's preemption and one-subject rule theories, the trial court determined the city's claim for a declaratory judgment in its entirety. Therefore, Civ. R. 54(B) was inapplicable, and the judgment was a final, appealable order. The Buck Act, 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 105 et seq., extended to state and local taxing authorities jurisdiction to levy taxes in a federal area within its borders as though the area was not a federal area. The State's authority, including the authority to limit the municipalities' taxing authority, remained the same whether the taxes concerned income earned within or outside a federal enclave. Because the State may constitutionally limit the taxing authority of municipalities outside of federal enclaves, it must retain that authority within federal enclaves under the second sentence of 4 U.S.C.S. 106(a). Therefore, because there was no conflict between the Buck Act and R.C. 718.01(H)(11), R.C. 718.01(H)(11) was not preempted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the decision and the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in applying the statute as written to the company's wetland mitigation bank. The company's wetland mitigation bank met the definition of &quot;land devoted exclusively to agricultural use&quot; under R.C. 5713.30(A)(1). Pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 36, the General Assembly defined &quot;agriculture&quot; at R.C. 5713.30(A)(1) to include land that qualified for payment in a conservation program under an agreement with a federal agency, such as wetland mitigation banks. Since the Ohio Constitution did not define the term &quot;agriculture,&quot; and the statute defined it to include wetland mitigation banks, there was no clear conflict between R.C. 5713.30(A)(1) and the Ohio Constitution. As a result, R.C. 5713.30(A)(1) was constitutional. The auditor failed to demonstrate that R.C. 5713.30(A)(1) was subject to interpretation. That statute was not ambiguous The express language of R.C. 5713.30(A)(1) clearly and unambiguously defined &quot;land devoted exclusively to agricultural use&quot; to include land that qualified for payment under a land conservation program under an agreement with a federal agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the injured party argued that the version of Ohio Rev.

The pre-Tort Reform Act version of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.263 prohibited the fact finder from hearing evidence on the issue of whether or not an injured party had been wearing a seatbelt. The Tort Reform Act, H.B. 350 (Ohio 1997) amended Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.263(F) to permit the finder of fact to hear evidence on the seatbelt issue. Subsequently, H.B. 215 (Ohio 1997) was enacted and used the identical language in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.26(F) as had been used in the Tort Reform Act. Applying Stevens and the pre-Tort Reform version of Ohio Rev.

The trial court found that the widow's claim was governed by the law as it existed prior to the effective date of Am. Sub. H.B. 292, Gen. Assem. (Ohio, 2004), and appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found retroactive application of Am. Sub. H.B. 292, Gen. Assem. (Ohio, 2004) (H.B. 292), violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The appellate court held such application did not unconstitutionally deprive the widow of a vested right, as she only had an expected future benefit based on the law's anticipated continuance, and no vested right existed in common law rules. R.C. &sect; 2307.91(FF)'s definition, enacted by H.B. 292, of &quot;substantial contributing factor&quot; did not conflict with the formerly applied &quot;substantial factor&quot; test, so no substantive right was impaired. R.C. &sect; 2307.91(FF)'s requirement that &quot;competent medical authority&quot; find no injury would have occurred absent asbestos exposure did not conflict with the &quot;substantial factor&quot; test as defining &quot;competent medical authority,&quot; previously applied in such cases, was procedural, and its &quot;but for&quot; component was consistent with proximate cause's definition and the &quot;substantial factor&quot; test. H.B. 292 addressed collective asbestos exposure, but the &quot;substantial factor&quot; test addressed exposure to one product. H.B. 292's provisions were retroactively applicable remedial and curative statutes clarifying ambiguous phrases.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been reclassified as a Tier III sex offender pursuant to S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was previously convicted of four rapes and one count of gross sexual imposition. He was sentenced to imprisonment and classified as a sexually oriented offender, such that he was required to verify his registration information annually for a 10-year period. Thereafter, defendant was reclassified as a Tier III sex offender and he was required to register every 90 days for life. Defendant was subsequently indicted for failing to verify his address with the county sheriff's office. After his dismissal motion was denied, defendant entered a no contest plea and was sentenced to imprisonment. On appeal, the court found that based on prior case precedent, R.C. 2950.031 and 2950.032 had been deemed to violate the separation of powers doctrine. They were previously excised from the statutory scheme. Accordingly, defendant's reclassification as a Tier III sex offender by the Attorney General was unconstitutional. Further, his conviction for failure to verify his address every 90 days pursuant to the severed statutes could not be enforced. Thus, it was proper to reinstate the classification and registration order originally imposed on defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and vacated defendant's conviction for failure to verify. It reinstated his original classification as a sexually oriented offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reviewed the new school funding plan in Am. Sub. H.B. 94 (Ohio 2001) and determined that, despite the extensive efforts of the state and the others to produce a plan that met the requirements previously announced by the state supreme court, changes to the formula were required to make the new plan constitutional. The state supreme court held, first, that the base cost formula, which recalculated the cost per student of providing an adequate education, had to be modified to include the top 5 percent districts and the lower 5 percent districts, and had to consider only those districts that actually met 20 of 27 performance standards without rounding. Second, the choice of the lower of fiscal year 1996 expenditures or fiscal year 1999 actual expenditures to calculate the base cost amount was unsupported by the evidence and should not have been used to lower the base cost amount figure. Third, the parity aid program, which attempted to provide poorer districts with funds similar to those available to wealthier districts, had to be fully funded no later than the beginning of fiscal year 2004, rather than fiscal year 2006.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the court vacated defendant's maximum sentence on the authority of Foster and remanded the matter for resentencing, the Pickaway County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) conducted a resentencing hearing and again imposed the same maximum sentence previously imposed. Defendant contended that the trial court violated both the Due Process Clause and the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution by resentencing him to the maximum term in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the trial court's judgment resentencing defendant to the maximum five-year prison term upon his conviction for the third degree felony of sexual battery, the court noted that it had considered and rejected numerous times the same ex post facto and due process arguments raised by defendant. In affirming the trial court's judgment and overruling defendant's assignment of error, the court found that defendant had notice of the sentencing range at the time that he committed the offense. Foster neither judicially increased the range of his sentence nor retroactively applied a new statutory maximum to an earlier committed crime. Since the range of penalties for defendant's offense remained the same post-Foster as it was pre-Foster, the application of Foster's remedy did not violate his due process rights or act as an ex post facto application of the law. Further, the court noted that, as an Ohio appellate court, it was bound to follow the Supreme Court of Ohio's decision in Foster and could not overrule Foster or declare it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of a judgment from the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed an administrative decision of appellee, a city public health department (PHD). The PHD determined that the owner had to abandon his septic system (SS) at his residence and connect to the city sewer system pursuant to Akron, Ohio, Codified Ordinance 50.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's residence was built over 75 years ago, and it was equipped with a SS. Upon a prior inspection of the residence, the PHD determined that the SS was operable and that connection to the city sanitary sewer was not required at that time. Thereafter, the residence was sold to the owner. He was notified that he had to abandon his SS and connect to the city sewer system pursuant to &sect; 50.02. The owner's administrative appeal was denied after a hearing, and the trial court also ruled in favor of the city. On further review, the court found no error in the trial court's determination that the city was not estopped from ordering the abandonment of the SS. The requirement that the owner connect to the city system was a governmental function. There was no indication in the statutory language or intent pursuant to R.C. 1.48 that &sect; 50.02 was only to be applied prospectively, and the owner failed to show that compliance by him amounted to an impermissible retroactive application under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. As R.C. 6117.51 only applied to certain county entities, the statutory exemption in &sect; 6117.51(C) was properly deemed not applicable to the owner's system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), alleging a sentence in a ballot issue adopted by voters was unconstitutional, under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city, declaring that the contested sentence was unconstitutionally retroactive. Appellant voter sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence held unconstitutional reduced a city council's at-large members from three to one by eliminating offices of members obtaining the second and third largest vote totals in an election held before the ballot issue was adopted. The appellate court held the sentence was retroactive because it reduced at-large city council members based on a prior election. Such a reduction could not rely on an event that occurred before deciding the reduction was needed. The sentence was substantive because, by seating only one of six candidates in one at-large position, it attached a new burden to a past transaction which held a reasonable expectation of finality. Voters sought to elect three candidates in the prior election with an expectation of finality. The sentence fundamentally changed the election's finality in that its effect was that voters chose only one candidate for one position. The sentence also disrupted certified election results showing three of six candidates being seated to three open positions by later selecting only one candidate to complete the term, attaching a new burden to a past transaction which held an expectation of finality for voters and candidates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The liquor permit was revoked for engaging or allowing physical contact (touching, fondling, or caressing buttocks, female breasts, or self or patrons) to occur. The permit holder stipulated to the underlying facts, but challenged the constitutionality of the underlying administrative code. Since the specific section violations were not specified, the appellate court undertook an analysis and reviewed, for overbreadth and vagueness, the sections it found applicable. &quot;Lewd activities,&quot; as used in Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-52(B)(1), was found to be substantially overbroad and unconstitutional, in that it incorporated a large amount of protected material. &quot;Improper conduct of any kind,&quot; as used in Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-52(B)(7), was also unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. However, the provisions were found to be severable, and by striking the word &quot;touch&quot; from Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-52(B)(3), the rest of that subsection was found to be constitutional. It forbade the fondling or caressing of certain anatomical areas.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, defendant's live-in girlfriend, was granted a five-year civil protection order against defendant. Subsequently, after two cases were joined, pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 13, the Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted defendant of two counts of violating a protection order, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.27.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his constitutional rights were violated when he was ordered to serve his sentences consecutively. The appellate court held that the issue was moot since defendant had completed his sentence. Further, the conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The protection order clearly prohibited defendant from making any contact, including telephone contact, with the victim. Because the victim's phone line was blocked from the jail, defendant got someone to place a three-way call. The victim's testimony that defendant called her cell phone, if believed, was sufficient to establish the violation of the protection order. Also, the victim's testimony was corroborated at the trial. Finally, defendant failed to rebut the presumption of constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.27 beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no due process issue. The evidence established that he received a copy and acknowledged receipt of the civil protection order approximately one week before the incident at issue. The record also showed that defendant was familiar with civil protection orders and had knowledge that he should not violate them.</SPAN></P>

The inmate had been previously convicted of attempted rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) and 2923.02, and he was reclassified as a Tier III sex offender (SO).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the inmate's conviction, he was designated as a sexually oriented offender. Thereafter, S.B. 10 amended R.C.

He contested it pursuant to R.C. 2950.031(E), 2950.032(E), and 2950.11(H) and raised constitutional challenges to S.B. 10. Based on judicial precedent, the trial court upheld the constitutionality of S.B. 10. On appeal, the court held that under the principles of stare decisis and the precedential holding of Barker, the constitutional challenges lacked merit. More specifically, the court held that there was no violation of the prohibition against ex post facto or retroactive legislation, and there was no violation of double jeopardy, cruel and unusual punishment, and separation of powers. The court held that the inmate lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the residency restrictions under R.C. 2950.034.

The court held that stare decisis was not controlling in cases presenting a constitutional question; therefore, stare decisis did not compel the court to reach the same result that it had reached in past decisions. The court concluded that the reclassification scheme of the AWA, found in R.C. 2950.031 and R.C. 2950.032 and which required the attorney general to reclassify offenders who were previously classified by Ohio judges according to the provisions in Megan's Law and its precursor, violated the separation-of-powers doctrine by impermissibly instructing the executive branch to review past decisions of the judicial branch. Further, &sect; 2950.031 and &sect; 2950.032 violated the separation-of-powers doctrine by requiring the opening of final judgments, in that these statutes required the attorney general to reclassify sex offenders whose classifications had already been adjudicated by a court and made the subject of a final order. The court held that &sect; 2950.031 and &sect; 2950.032 were severed, and it reinstated the classifications and community-notification and registration orders previously imposed.</SPAN></P>

Two gun organizations moved to intervene as defendants and to bring cross-claims against the city alleging that local firearm ordinances were unconstitutional. The motions were denied. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted appellee State's motion for summary judgment. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City argued that the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment because R.C. 9.68 violated Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, the Home Rule Amendment. The appellate court held that the trial court erred by denying the city's motion for summary judgment. Because R.C. 9.68 failed to satisfy the general law test, it was not a general law. Therefore, R.C. 9.68&nbsp;unconstitutionally attempted to limit municipalities' home-rule police powers. Under the Canton test, R.C. 9.68 was not part of a statewide and comprehensive legislative enactment. Although Sub. H.B. 347, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) pertained to a matter of statewide concern, it was not comprehensive and left a great deal of firearm activity unregulated. Further, with R.C. 9.68, the State attempted to curtail the city's home-rule police powers without enacting legislation to remedy the purported ill of a confusing &quot;patchwork&quot; of municipal regulations involving firearms. Finally, R.C. 9.68 did not prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally. Additionally, R.C. 9.68 violated the separation-of-powers doctrine espoused by the Ohio Constitution in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held the offenders lacked standing to contest R.C. 2950.034's residency restrictions because (1) nothing showed they lived within a proscribed area or had to leave such an area, and (2) they showed no present intent to live in a proscribed area. They lacked standing to contest S.B. 10's failure to give counsel to indigent offenders contesting reclassifications because (1) they sought no appointed counsel, and (2) the same lawyer represented them. S.B. 10's retroactive application did not deny them due process because they were denied no protected liberty or property interest. S.B. 10's retroactive application to them did not offend ex post facto protections because the legislature intended S.B. 10 to be civil and non-punitive, and its effect was not so punitive as to negate that intent. Its registration and community notification provisions did not offend double jeopardy because they were non-punitive. The offenders lacked standing to claim its retroactive application to them impaired contracts, contrary to U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators, an Ohio labor union, its president, and a national labor union, filed an original action in mandamus seeking to prevent respondents, the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation and the Industrial Commission of Ohio, from enforcing amendments to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.54 that were enacted in Am. Sub. H.B. 122 (Ohio 2000). A motion by the Bureau and the Commission to dismiss the action was denied and an alternative writ granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The unions and the union president sought to prevent enforcement of H.B. 122. The issue was whether H.B. 122, which permitted warrantless drug and alcohol testing of injured workers, was constitutional. The court granted the writ, finding that H.B. 122 violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The court held that the unions and the president had standing because H.B. 122 implicated a public right. Further, the State's significant promotion of drug testing through the exercise of power created the close nexus between the State and the challenged action required to constitute state action. The collection of blood and urine samples was deemed a search for Fourth Amendment purposes. The warrantless searches, however, could not be justified through the &quot;special needs&quot; analysis because the need for testing did not override the acknowledged privacy interests of individuals. In cases that permitted suspicionless drug testing, the situations and targeted groups were unique and discrete. H.B. 122, however, allowed searches of everyone who worked in Ohio, in contravention of the additional expectation of privacy enjoyed by Ohio workers in the workers' compensation context.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the trial court found that the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant even if the field sobriety test results were inadmissible. Because the trial court's determination on the issue of probable cause was made independent of the field sobriety test results, defendant's constitutional question was moot. The denial of defendant's motion to suppress was proper. Defendant did not dispute that she was stopped because she was driving her vehicle erratically and exceeding the lawful speed limit. The officer noticed that defendant smelled of alcohol and had bloodshot eyes. Defendant admitted to consuming one glass of wine; however, when the officer asked her for her identification, she presented her credit card. While the results of the field sobriety tests were not admissible as evidence of probable cause to arrest, the officer's observations regarding defendant's impairment sufficed to create the necessary probable cause to arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The excavation company leased a parcel of land within the city that historically had been operated as a surface mine for sand and gravel. The property was zoned for single-family residential use, but was intermittently operated as a mine until 1998 pursuant to a nonconforming use zoning certificate issued by the city, and a surface mine permit. The company filed an application for a conditional use permit to reestablish mining operations on the property. Anticipating that its application would be denied, the company filed a complaint for declaratory judgment. The trial court found in favor of the city. The appellate court found that, based on the stipulated facts, the excavation company contended that the city's prohibition of mining on the property was arbitrary. The appellate court could not conclude on the record that the zoning of the districts containing the property for residential use, and prohibition of mining operations therein, was arbitrary. Further, the appellate court found that the company's claim that the city's zoning ordinance was unconstitutional was barred by res judicata.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio), he was later notified that he had been reclassified as a Tier III sex offender. He petitioned to contest the reclassification and to be exempted from the notification provisions of R.C. 2950.11. The Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied the petition and reclassified him. The offender appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender argued that S.B. 10 was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that, with respect to the offender, S.B. 10 violated the federal constitutional ban on ex post facto laws because S.B. 10's intent was punitive and its effect was punitive. Those portions of S.B. 10 controlling the sentencing of sex offenders indicated that the classification was part of the sentence imposed and thus, part of the offender's punishment. Further, S.B. 10 was an unconstitutional retroactive law, as applied to the offender. By its terms, it applied retroactively. It attached new burdens and disabilities to a past transaction, since it violated the constitutional protections against ex post facto laws. Additionally, the application of S.B. 10 to the offender violated the prohibition in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 against laws impairing the obligation of contracts. His plea agreement remained an executory contract at the time of his reclassification under S.B. 10 and, by changing his classification from sexually oriented offender to Tier III offender, the State unilaterally imposed new affirmative duties upon him in relation to the contract. Finally, S.B. 10 violated separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the cause was remanded for further proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a judgment from the Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which reclassified him as a Tier III sex offender as required by the Ohio version of the Adam Walsh Act, Am. Sub. S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2009). The inmate was previously convicted of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), and he was classified as a sexually oriented offender (SOO).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate entered a guilty plea to rape and he was classified as a SOO. After the enactment of S.B. 10, the inmate was notified of his reclassification. He contested it under R.C. 2950.031(E) based on assorted alleged constitutional violations. After a hearing, the trial court held that the inmate was properly reclassified. On appeal, the court found that the reclassification did not violate the doctrine of res judicata. As the reclassification was both procedurally and substantively different than the scheme under which the inmate was previously classified, res judicata did not bar the reclassification. Further, the reclassification under S.B. 10 did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers, as the inmate had no reasonable expectation of finality in the collateral consequence of his sex offender classification. The application of S.B. 10 to the inmate was not unconstitutional based on prior holdings. Additionally, the court noted that challenges under ex post facto and retroactivity principles lacked merit, as S.B. 10 was a non-punitive, civil, regulatory scheme. There was no violation of double jeopardy under U.S. Const. amend. V and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it classified him as a sexual predator. The State argued that defendant's challenges to the trial court's sexual predator adjudication had been rendered moot by the passage of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (AWA) in 2007. The appellate court held that the appeal had been rendered moot because the Ohio General Assembly intended for the sexual offender statutes to apply retroactively. Because the AWA applied retroactively, defendant was no longer classified as a sexual predator. Nothing in the AWA amounted to an impermissible or retroactive violation of a vested right. Thus, any error the trial court might have committed in making that adjudication under the old classification scheme had been rendered moot. Therefore, the appeal had to be dismissed because no case or controversy existed to be resolved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Ohio Attorney General, the State of Ohio, and the Ohio Department of Health (ODH), appealed from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), granting declaratory and injunctive relief to appellee citizens on their claim that H.B. 544, Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under a Master Settlement Agreement with American tobacco product manufacturers, the State of Ohio received payments from the manufacturers. A tobacco use prevention and control foundation was created in Ohio and was involved in the disbursement of the payments. The foundation's executive director, pursuant to a resolution of the foundation's board, executed a contract with the nonprofit corporation on behalf of the foundation. However, state legislation was enacted which diverted funds to a jobs bill. On appeal, the court found that, because the Ohio General Assembly had plenary legislative power to revoke or transfer public funds, it acted constitutionally through H.B. 544, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) in transferring the monies in an endowment fund to other economic priorities. Thus, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1 and 22 were not violated. In addition, the foundation's board violated R.C. 121.22 by improperly convening in executive session and by deliberating upon issues not raised in the motion to convene. The board's resolution resulted from those nonpublic deliberations. Accordingly, the contract between the foundation and the nonprofit corporation was invalid and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The elections officials determined that the candidate's nominating petitions lacked the number of valid signatures necessary to place his name on a general election ballot. On appeal, the court, upon review of nominating petitions entered into evidence, found that the officials neither abused their discretion under R.C. 3501.38 nor clearly disregarded applicable law in invalidating signatures on the candidate's nominating petitions. Therefore, the candidate failed to show that he had a legal right to compel the officials to certify his candidacy and place his name on the general election ballot as an independent candidate. In addition, the candidate had standing to challenge R.C. 3501.257 as he ended up with less than the required number of signatures. Finally, R.C. 3513.257 was constitutional as it did not impose a severe burden on voters' and candidates' constitutional rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendment, and R.C. 3513.257 imposed reasonable, nondiscriminatory qualifying conditions on independent candidates consistent with the State of Ohio's interest in regulating the election process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to three years on each of the burglary convictions and to 18 months on each of the attempt convictions. One of the burglary convictions was to be served consecutive to the other three terms. The other three terms were to be served concurrently.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.14(B), (C), (D)(2), (3), (E)(4), .19(B)(2), .41(A) from the valid portions of the Ohio sentencing statutes. This left trial courts with full discretion to impose a prison term within the basic ranges of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.14(A) based upon a jury verdict or admission of a defendant without the mandated judicial findings that Blakely prohibited. Accordingly, all cases pending on direct review at the time of the high court decision had to be remanded for new sentencing hearings in accordance with the high court's opinion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizen sought a declaration in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that Ohio's Desertion of Child Under 72 Hours Old Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.3515 et seq., was unconstitutional or that certain of its provisions violated separation of powers, equal protection, and due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen claimed the legislation, which allowed the voluntary surrender of a newborn to a &quot;safe haven,&quot; denied non-surrendering parents and children their constitutional right to notice of proceedings affecting parental rights. The appellate court held the citizen did not allege he had been injured by the legislation, claiming the public-right doctrine, which allowed a party to challenge legislation even though the party was not directly injured by it, when the issue sought to be litigated was of great importance and interest to the public. The challenged statute was not the type of legislation to which this exception to standing applied, and this was not the rare and extraordinary case that gave rise to the application of that doctrine, so the citizen could not avail himself of this exception to traditional standing requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administrator challenged a decision from the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas, Ohio, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee bar in a case arising under the Ohio Dram Shop Act, former R.C. 4301.22.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While driving, a patron killed the administrator's daughter. Summary judgment was granted to the bar on the claim under the Act, a negligence case was dismissed, and the trial court found that there was no equal protection violation. This appeal followed. In partially affirming, the appellate court held that a genuine issue of material fact remained on the claim under former R.C. 4399.18(A)(1). The patron was served 9 beers at the bar, and bar employees had multiple opportunities to observe the patron. He was a regular at the bar and admitted to consuming about 8 beers per day. Further, he displayed several signs of intoxication after the accident. Circumstantial evidence could have been used to prove that the bar knowingly sold an intoxicating beverage to a noticeably intoxicated person. Next, liability did not arise under former R.C. 4399.18(A)(2) based on the bar selling an intoxicating beverage to a person who habitually drank beer to excess. This did not give rise to an equal protection violation under former R.C. 4301.22(C). The statutory distinction between beer and intoxicating liquors bore a rational relationship to the achievement of a legitimate governmental purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision to grant summary judgment for the bar on the claim under former R.C. 4399.18(A)(1) was reversed. The trial court's finding that former R.C. 4301.22(C) was constitutional and its entry of summary judgment on the claim under former R.C. 4299.18(A)(2) were affirmed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The statute and the state constitution were not incompatible. Appellants failed to challenge the trial court's findings that the liquidated damages clause presents a question that was not ripe for review, thus foreclosing them from arguing that the clause was unconstitutional on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant law enforcement officers appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County (Ohio) which granted plaintiff citizens' claim for declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12, 16(B), (C) which banned carrying concealed weapons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the law enforcement officers and others contended that there were adequate safeguards built into Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12 in the form of affirmative defenses to safeguard the rights of law abiding citizens. The appellate court found that the record reflected that these affirmative defenses were largely ignored at the initial point of contact between a citizen and an officer. The act of carrying a concealed weapon typically resulted in arrest, and affirmative defenses were sorted out later. The practical effect then was to expose a citizen to arrest, indictment, and prosecution for what later could be determined to have been the legal exercise of a fundamental right. Further, the appellate courts found that trial courts applied the law inconsistently, and appellate courts fared no better. The result, which was confusing or opaque to the average citizen--and to police officers, lawyers, judges, and jurors--was an unconstitutional delegation of public policy matters. The appellate found, finally, that when the police, the citizens, and the courts all must guess at the meaning of a criminal statute, subjective and arbitrary enforcement was the result.</SPAN></P>

It was rationally related to the non-punitive purpose of protecting the public from released sex offenders because it alerted the public to the potential presence of such offenders, and the legislative choice to categorize offenders based on the crime committed did not make it irrational. It was not error to deny the offender's motion for relief from community notification because, under R.C. 2950.031, it was the offender's burden to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that he was not subject to such notification, but he did not meet this burden, as he presented no evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturers sought administrative dismissal of the worker's case due to his failure to provide medical evidence of a prima facie case, as required by Am.

The appellate court held a &quot;savings clause&quot; in R.C. 2307.93(A)(3)(a) allowed the trial court to apply the law that existed before the effective date of H.B. 292 if the court found that a party's substantive right would be impaired by retroactively applying H.B. 292, in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. However, in this case, the trial court did not deny the manufacturers' motion to dismiss by relying on this savings clause. Thus, based on case law providing that the retroactive application of the procedural requirements of H.B. 292 to a case pending when H.B. 292 became effective did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, it was error to decline to retroactively apply R.C. 2307.91, R.C. 2307.92, and R.C. 2307.93.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, which was denied. He then pled no contest to two counts of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs (OMVI), under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(1)(a) and (h), with specifications under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.1413, and weaving in a lane of travel. The Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sentenced him to two years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19, as revised by H.B. 163, Gen. Assem. (Ohio), was unconstitutional because it violated the constitutional prohibition against retroactive application of laws and due process. The appellate court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 was not a retroactive law. The penalty enhancement provisions did not punish the past conduct; instead, they merely increased the severity of a penalty imposed for an OMVI violation that occurred after passage of the enhancement legislation. Further, the sentencing provisions, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.1413, clearly reflected the legislature's intent to create a penalty for a person who had been convicted of or pled guilty to five or more equivalent offenses within 20 years of the OMVI offense over and above the penalty imposed for the OMVI conviction itself. Because the legislature had specifically authorized cumulative punishment, it was not a double jeopardy violation. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2914.1413 also did not violate his due process rights as the statute had no effect on defendant's prior OMVI convictions. Rather, it was a mechanism for enhancing his current OMVI conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cities brought action against State seeking declaration that statutes governing use of public ways by public utilities were unconstitutional. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County, Daniel T. Hogan, J., held that: (1) statutes, which were enacted as rider on appropriations bill, were unconstitutional under the single-subject rule; (2) statutes did not violate the uniformity requirement of State Constitution; (3) provisions prohibiting municipalities from relying upon their constitutionally granted powers of local self-government to regulate, and charge a fee for, use of public ways by utility service providers and cable operators, for purposes of installing and operating their equipment and facilities, were unconstitutional under home rule amendment; and (4) question of whether statutes violated the takings clause of the United States Constitution was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cities sued defendant State of Ohio, seeking a declaration that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4939 was unconstitutional. It was enacted as a rider on a biennial appropriations bill. It limited the extent to which political subdivisions, such as the cities, could control the use of their own public ways by utility service providers and cable operators. Both the cities and the State moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cities argued, among other things, that the legislation violated the one-subject rule and deprived municipalities of their home rule powers. The State argued that the bill in question was an appropriations bill, which, of necessity, encompassed many items, all bound by a common thread. In rejecting the State's argument, the court found that the rider in question was a non-appropriation rider attached to an appropriation bill. As such, added caution was involved. The court found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the bill violated the single-subject rule, under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D). In addition, the subject was inherently controversial and of significant constitutional importance, as it attempted to deprive municipalities of their powers to regulate the use of their own roadways, in violation of the Home Rule Amendment, Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. Although a municipality did not have the power to effect a termination of a monopolistic utility server in a manner that would be inconsistent with the State's police regulations, it did have the power to enact reasonable, non-discriminatory regulations governing the use of, and fees for the use of, its municipal public ways.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cities' summary judgment motion was granted. The State's summary judgment motion was denied. The statutory chapter at issue was declared unconstitutional under the single-subject rule of the Ohio Constitution. It was declared not to violate uniformity requirements. Several sentences were declared unconstitutional, as being in violation of municipality home rule powers, and other statutory provisions were declared to be severable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city police department received a non-emergency call from a county Adult Protective Services employee, asking them to conduct a &quot;welfare check&quot; on an elderly bedridden male. The police officer who went to the house indicated to defendant, who answered the door, that he was checking for possible abuse, but defendant refused to let him in. It was noted that defendant was at his father's house at the time. Defendant was arrested and charged. The trial court denied defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal, pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 29(A), and defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court found that the obstruction charge was not supported by sufficient evidence, as defendant had an expectation of privacy at the house, and he had the right under the Fourth Amendment to exercise his privilege to refuse entry and to terminate any consensual encounter. Further, Akron, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 136.13 was inconsistent in application and effect with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.33, such that it was unconstitutional under Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A combination of concurrent and consecutive sentences had been imposed after defendant pled guilty to 30 separate counts that included kidnapping, felonious assault, and child endangering. The post-Foster sentence was affirmed. The trial court exercised its discretion in selecting specific sentences within defined ranges. As a result, defendant had no right to a jury determination of facts that the trial court deemed relevant. There was no merit to the argument that the Foster remedy of severance of unconstitutional portions of Ohio's sentencing statutes was itself unconstitutional as that was the approach the U.S. Supreme Court took in Booker. Arguments that Foster violated due process and the ex post facto provisions of the state and federal constitutions had been previously rejected. The severance of R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and R.C. 2929.41(A) removed only the presumptive and judicial findings related to upward departures from a statutory sentence range. The severance did not prohibit the imposition of consecutive sentences. Finally, as there was no ambiguity in the sentencing statutes, the rule of lenity, R.C. 2901.04(A), had no application to defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate contested his reclassification as a tier III sex offender, pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2950, as amended by Am. Sub. S.B. 10, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 2007) (the AWA), in the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio). The trial court granted the summary judgment motion of appellee State of Ohio. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate said the AWA violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The appellate court disagreed because, under the intent-effects test, (1) the general assembly did not intend it to be punitive, and (2) its effect did not negate that intent, as its registration requirement was de minimis, its requirements were not historically regarded as punitive, it required no finding of scienter, it did not promote retribution or deterrence, the behavior it applied to was not already a crime, it had an alternate purpose of public protection, and it was not excessive given that purpose. It was not unconstitutionally retroactive, under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, because (1) it was intended to be retroactive, and (2) it was remedial. His reclassification did not violate his right to contract, due to his plea bargain, because that contract was completed when he pled guilty and was sentenced. His reclassification violated separation of powers and res judicata doctrines because (1) his former classification was a final order, so no court could be statutorily ordered to modify it, and (2) it imposed enhanced requirements, changing the prior judgment in which he had a reasonable expectation of finality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed, but the inmate was required to continue registering as a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to four counts of aggravated robbery. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. He later filed a motion to vacate sentence. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) held a resentencing hearing, imposed the same sentence, and notified him regarding post-release control. Defendant appealed. The State cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted on cross-appeal that the trial court erred in resentencing defendant because it had properly instructed defendant regarding post-release control at his original sentencing hearing and in the judgment entry journalizing that sentence. The appellate court held that the trial court erred by resentencing defendant to 16 years in prison because, even if post-release control were not properly imposed at defendant's original sentencing hearing, the trial court was only permitted to &quot;resentence&quot; defendant to the extent of adding post-release control. Defendant's argument on appeal concerning consecutive sentences was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court in reimposing a mandatory five-year period of post-release control on defendant at the resentencing hearing was affirmed. However, the remainder of the trial court's resentence was vacated, leaving in tact defendant's original sentence in all respects except post-release control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, the Ross County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted defendant of three counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, one count of gross sexual imposition, and two counts of rape, under former R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b). He was designated as a Tier III sex offender and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him to mandatory five-year prison terms for each of his rape convictions. The appellate court held that the five-year sentences for each of defendant's rape convictions were neither clearly and convincingly contrary to law nor an abuse of discretion. His rape convictions resulted from the calculated and repeated victimization of two young boys who were under his supervision and who looked upon him as a trusted family friend. Defendant did not demonstrate that the combined 10 years that he received for the two rape convictions was unwarranted. Because rape was a first-degree felony, defendant was subject to a mandatory term of three to 10 years for each conviction pursuant to R.C. 2929.13(F)(2). Further, there was no due process violation because defendant was given notice and an opportunity to be heard at his sexual offender classification hearing. As a convicted sex offender, he had no settled expectations or vested rights as to the registration obligations imposed upon him. Finally, because the provisions of R.C. Chapter 2950 were remedial in nature, not punitive, there was no violation of ex post facto or double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee workers' compensation claimant brought an action in the Washington County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) challenging the constitutionality of R.C. &sect;&sect; 4123.93 and 4123.931, after appellant, the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, asserted a subrogation right against the claimant's tort settlement. The trial court found the statutes violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 16 and 19, and the Bureau appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant said R.C. &sect;&sect; 4123.93 and 4123.931 denied him due process by assuming his tort settlement was a double recovery for benefits the Bureau paid and providing no way to litigate the subrogation amount. The appellate court held the statutes' current versions were not unconstitutional, under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 16 and 19 because the claimant did not have to reimburse the Bureau for benefits not received, could keep any remainder of his tort award after the Bureau's duty to make payments ended, guarding against its windfall and doing away with his risk of overestimating liability for future values, and the potential for a disparate result between the claimant, who settled his tort claim, and those who tried their claims was eliminated. The state had a legitimate interest in minimizing losses to the workers' compensation fund and self-insuring employers due to third-party tortfeasors to the extent it barred the claimant's double recovery, and, as the Bureau only recouped to the extent there was a double recovery, and the claimant had a substantial opportunity to show amounts that were not a double recovery, equal protection was not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant former employee appealed the summary judgment (Civ. R. 56(C)) entered in favor of appellee, her former employer, by the Portage County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio). At issue was whether a genuine issue of material fact existed on the former employee's intentional tort claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three of the former employee's fingers had been partially severed by a punch press machine. The former employee argued that the current version of R.C. 2745.01(A), which governed causes of action premised upon employer intentional torts, was unconstitutional, and that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the former employer on the basis of this statute. The appeals court agreed. Since R.C. 2745.01(A) had been found unconstitutional, the court followed the Fyffe test in analyzing the former employee's claim. In order to avoid summary judgment, she was required to produce Civ. R. 56 evidentiary materials demonstrating that the former employer knew she was placing fittings directly in a die without using wrist restraints, as she was required to do by the former employer's policy. This she failed to do. She conceded that she was trained by the former employer's manufacturing manager that whenever a press operator used a press, he or she was required to use wrist restraints. Because there was no evidence in the record that the former employer had knowledge of the existence of a dangerous condition in its workplace, the former employee's argument lacked merit.</SPAN></P>
