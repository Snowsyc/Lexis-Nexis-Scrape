<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellee citizens' declaratory judgment action for an order directing the state legislature to pass legislation enabling an election on a proposed reform of a county's government, appellants, the state house of delegates' speaker and the state senate president, challenged the determination of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia) that the legislature had a duty under W. Va. Const. art. IX, &sect; 13 to pass enabling legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question presented was what requirements, if any, were imposed on the Legislature by W. Va. Const. art. 9, &sect; 13, to act on the petition. The court held that art. 9, &sect; 13 did not require the Legislature to enact legislation enabling the reformation upon receipt of a reformation petition. Receipt of a county commission's request to act on a petition signed by ten percent of that county's voters to reform county government simply triggered the legislative process. The Legislature retained its discretion to approve or reject a bill authorizing a county-wide election on the requested reformation. The Legislature was not compelled to approve legislation authorizing a county-wide election on the reformation proposed in the petition if the Legislature concluded that the proposed reformation would violate the constitution. If a petition for reformation of county government was presented to the Legislature pursuant to art. 9, &sect; 13 and the legislative process did not result in the enactment of enabling legislation prior to the end of the legislative session, then, in order for a subsequent Legislature, during its two year term, to address the issue, a new petition had to be submitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, individually and as administratrix of a deceased employee's estate, sought reversal of and/or prohibition of an order of the Circuit Court of Harrison County (West Virginia) that dismissed her common-law negligence claims against appellees, an employer and two co-workers, for failure to state a claim on the grounds that appellees were entitled to W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 23-2-6, 23-2-6a immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administratrix claimed that the doctrine of respondeat superior or vicarious liability should have been considered. The court disagreed. W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 23-2-6, 23-2-6a immunized the employer and co-workers from common law liability for the death that occurred on a public highway while the employee was riding in a car driven by a co-worker who fell asleep at the wheel after they left the employer's premises after working a double shift. The special hazard or increased risk (sleep deprivation) involved by working a double shift was an integral part of the work. The required extra shift satisfied an important business need. The trip home was foreseeable and was an essential part of the special service the co-worker performed after work. The double shift requirement indirectly increased the risk of harm to the co-worker and the employee by causing or contributing to the co-worker's sleep deprivation. Because of the increased risk of harm as a result of the work-related activities, the trip home was within the course and scope of employment as a special circumstance within the context of the going and coming rule set forth in Brown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant manufacturer sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of McDowell County (West Virginia) which denied its motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial in a product liability case in which the jury found appellee driver's vehicle was defective because the air bags failed to deploy. The manufacturer argued that the trial court erred by, inter alia, not permitting it to introduce any safety belt evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver lost control of her vehicle, went over an embankment, crashed into a tree, and came to rest in a river. The air bag failed to deploy and the driver sustained serious injuries. The trial court granted a motion in limine to exclude safety belt evidence based upon W. Va. Code &sect; 17C-15-49 (2004). The appellate court held that, although couched in different terms, the manufacturer's intended use of the evidence related to negligence and mitigation of damages and would allow the manufacturer to show that the driver contributed to her enhanced injury by failing to wear her safety belt, which in turn could influence the issue of mitigation of damages. Without a proviso excluding crashworthiness cases, such use of that evidence was in derogation of the express terms of the safety belt statute. The defective nature of the product was demonstrated in various ways by the driver's reconstruction expert and the Morningstar standard was satisfied. The jury instructions were proper and the jury reached its conclusion within the parameters of the evidence presented. Thus, the trial court correctly refused to grant judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia) that denied its W. Va. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the sua sponte dismissal of its declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration of its obligation to respond to appellee newspaper's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests relating to time sheets and activity logs for certain named officers of the City's police department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper sought records following public allegations of double-dipping. The City's complaint sought relief under W. Va. Code &sect; 55-13-12. The court found that the sua sponte dismissal denied the parties an opportunity to be heard, in violation of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10, and was reversible error. The court addressed the merits because a remand without guidance on the issue of public employee payroll records would have resulted in an appeal on the same set of facts. While the court had not previously addressed whether public employee payroll records had to be disclosed, other states construed their open records laws as requiring disclosure. The court concluded that the release of the records was not a substantial invasion of individual privacy. There was no evidence that the police officers had a reasonable expectation that their time records were confidential. The City did not consider those records to be an important part of their employment records. The newspaper sought the records for a valuable public interest. The information was not available from other sources. The City should have disclosed the time sheets since they were public records not exempt from disclosure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision and remanded the case to the circuit court for entry of an order consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found that defendant sold crack cocaine to an undercover police officer. In finding that defendant had a prior conviction, the circuit court relied on defendant's court file that contained evidence of defendant's previous guilty plea to a charge of possession with intent to deliver crack cocaine. Defendant chose to remain silent when asked to affirm his prior conviction. The jury did not determine whether defendant had a prior conviction. Defendant argued that although W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-4-408 met federal constitutional standards, the statute denied him due process rights under W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. On appeal, the court found that W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-4-408, which permitted sentencing enhancement for certain repeat drug offenders based solely on the fact of a previous drug conviction, did not violate the due process protections found in W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. Accordingly, the court found no infirmity with the enhancement of defendant's sentence pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-4-408.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court affirmed the orders by the county commission. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, two out-of-state corporations operating in West Virginia, challenged the appraisals on the taxpayers' production facilities in West Virginia, and the tax assessments resulting therefrom, for two tax years. The taxpayers also challenged the constitutionality of the review procedures set forth in W. Va. Code &sect; 11-3-24 (Repl. Vol. 2008). On appeal, the court found that the review procedures set forth in W. Va. Code &sect; 11-3-24 were constitutional because permitting county commissions to sit as boards of equalization and review to hear and decide the taxpayers' challenges of allegedly erroneous tax assessments did not unconstitutionally deprive the taxpayers of a hearing before an impartial tribunal as required by U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. Further, requiring the taxpayers to prove entitlement to relief from the tax assessments by clear and convincing evidence was constitutional as it did not deny the taxpayers of due process. Finally, the taxpayers failed to prove that the tax commissioner abused his discretion in the property valuations for the tax assessments under W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 1 and W. Va.

The SSAC challenged orders of the Circuit Court of Cabell County (West Virginia), which ruled that SSAC Rule 127-3-15.3 was unconstitutional due to the absence of administrative review following ejection from a game, SSAC Rule 127-3-8 was unconstitutional, and the SSAC was a state agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was ejected from a basketball game for committing two technical fouls. Under SSAC rules, he was automatically suspended for two games. The student sought to prohibit the SSAC from enforcing the suspension. The parties reached a settlement agreement, but the trial court proceeded to address the constitutionality of the SSAC rules. The supreme court held that the trial court's attempt  to declare Rule 127-3-15.3 unconstitutional for lacking an administrative review process before imposing a suspension sanction was without any basis in the law. The due process protections the trial court found lacking were inapplicable because no constitutionally protected interest attached to participation in interscholastic sports. The trial court's advisory ruling on the forfeiture rule was improper. Rule 127-3-8 was never raised in the pleadings or implicated in any fashion during the case. The SSAC was not a state agency. It was in existence for 51 years before the enactment of W. Va. Code &sect; 18-2-25, the legislature had no control over the makeup of the governing board of the SSAC, participation in the SSAC was not compulsory, and the SSAC did not receive legislative appropriations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the order as to: (1) the ruling that the lack of administrative review prior to imposition of a multi-game suspension under the SSAC rules was unconstitutional, (2) the requirement that the SSAC amend its rules to conform with the trial court's order, (3) the ruling that the SSAC forfeiture rule was unconstitutional, (4) the ruling that the SSAC was a state agency, and (5) the award of attorney's fees to the student.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed an action against appellee hospital pursuant to the Medical Professional Liability Act (MPLA). She challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Cabell County (West Virginia), which granted the hospital's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the 2003 amendments to W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-9 (2003) (Supp. 2008), which took effect on July 1, 2003, precluded her from pursuing an ostensible agency claim against the hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother instituted her medical malpractice action against a doctor, alleging that he was negligent in treating her child. She was granted leave to file an amended complaint to add the hospital. The supreme court held that the trial court's summary judgment ruling represented plain error. Plain and reversible error existed in the trial court's implicit determination that the mother's ostensible agency claim against the hospital did not relate back to the date that the original complaint was filed. The mother initially filed the case on April 23, 2003. On June 15, 2005, she raised the ostensible agency claim against the hospital by obtaining leave of court to amend the original complaint in accord with W. Va. R. Civ. P. 15(a). The statute of limitations governing the cause of action of a minor, W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-4 (1986) (2000), had not expired at the time the amended complaint was filed. The child had a substantial right in pursuing her claim against the hospital. She was only four years old when the alleged acts of malpractice occurred in 1999. Thus, under &sect; 55-7B-4, the limitations period for filing suit did not expire until the child's twelfth birthday in 2007.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the summary judgment order of the trial court and remanded the case to proceed under the provisions of the MPLA in effect at the time the original complaint was filed on April 23, 2003.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer discovered errors in its tax returns and applied to the county commission for relief.

Petitioner prosecutor petitioned for a writ of certiorari with the trial court seeking reversal of that decision. The trial court reversed the county commission's decision. The state supreme court found that (1) the prosecutor had the power to challenge the decision in the trial court because W. Va. R. Civ. P. 17(a), regarding real parties in interest, did not bar him from defending against a claim, (2) the trial court correctly applied a de novo standard of review, as W. Va.

The organization did not present evidence to prove that it was denied due process when the Commission sat as the Board to hear and decide its appeal of the tax assessment. The circuit court did not err by requiring the organization to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the assessor's tax assessment was erroneous. The imposition of that burden of proof did not deprive the organization of due process. The organization did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that its status as a 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 501(c)(3) corporation was not adequately considered in assessing taxes on its property.</SPAN></P>

The BOR granted to appellee claimant a 5% permanent partial disability award for occupational pneumoconiosis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the employer alleged that the claimant failed to show that he had been exposed to the hazards of occupational pneumoconiosis for the period required by W. Va. Code &sect; 23-4-15b (1995). The court found that the BOR and the OOJ properly considered the facts before them within the ordinary and accepted meaning of &quot;hazard&quot; as set forth in Meadows and the judge considered testimony as to visible dust in the workplace and the fact that asbestos was present prior to being abated during the 1980's. The BOR's decision as to the nonmedical claim was not clearly erroneous. However, as to the medical claim, the BOR violated its standard of review. By favoring unreliable medical evidence over reliable medical evidence, the BOR's order was clearly wrong in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence of the whole record. Equally missing was any analysis of the law, especially with regard to the deference to be accorded to the findings and conclusions of the Occupational Pneumoconiosis Board on medical issues. As amply found by the OOJ, the claimant did not meet his burden with competent, reliable medical proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the BOR's order that affirmed the OOJ's September interlocutory order on the non-medical exposure issue claim, reversed the determination as to the medical claim, vacated the grant of a 5% permanent partial disability award and remanded the matter with directions to reinstate the order granting no award for occupational pneumoconiosis disability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court noted that the inmate called seven witnesses, who were shackled and wore prison attire while they testified. Their testimony corroborated the inmate's testimony that he did not conspire to murder the victim and did not know that the victim was going to be killed. Two of the State's key witnesses were inmates at the warden's facility when the murder occurred, but were transferred to different facilities in exchange for their testimony. The State's witnesses were permitted to wear civilian clothing at trial, and were not forced to wear shackles during their testimony. In allowing the State's key witnesses to testify in civilian attire and without shackles, while key witnesses for the inmate testified in prison clothing and were ordered to be bound and shackled at trial, the trial court violated the inmate's right to a fair jury trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 14. The impact on the jury of the glaring disparity in the witnesses' physical appearance could not be understated. Finally, the reasons for the shackling of each witness had to be articulated.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the burglary conviction. An unauthorized entry was not an element of daytime burglary by breaking and entering. The evidence had to show that defendant committed a breaking and entering with the intent to commit a crime in the house. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant broke a window and entered the mother's house with the intent to harm the girlfriend and/or the mother. The jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant confined the girlfriend for one of the purposes enumerated in &sect; 61-2-14a. Defendant's sentence was not subject to appellate review because the sentence imposed for each conviction was within the statutory limit, and defendant identified no impermissible factor upon which his sentence was based. The trial court did not err in declining to answer the jury's questions regarding wanton endangerment. Because the trial court's instruction defining that crime was identical to W. Va.

Va. Code &sect; 61-5-29 (1999) (Repl. Vol. 2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was ordered to pay monthly child support. The mother of his child filed a complaint, alleging that he failed to pay his support obligation. Defendant was charged with failure to meet an obligation to provide support to a minor in violation of &sect; 61-5-29. A jury found him guilty. The supreme court held that W. Va. Code &sect; 61-5-29(3)&nbsp;unconstitutionally shifted to defendant the burden of disproving an element of the offense and violated the due process clauses found in W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. W. Va. Code &sect; 61-5-29(3) included a reasonable ability to provide support as an element of the crime and as an affirmative defense. W. Va. Code &sect; 61-5-29 did not meet the criteria that would require the supreme court to declare the entire statute unconstitutional. Rather, W. Va. Code &sect; 61-5-29(1) and (2) set out complete criminal offenses that were independent from the affirmative defense established in W. Va. Code &sect; 61-5-29(3). That individual provision, severed from the remainder of W. Va. Code &sect; 61-5-29, was unconstitutional and unenforceable, and W. Va. Code &sect; 61-5-29(1) and (2) remained fully enforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer claimed that he could not be held personally liable for sales taxes that were collected but not remitted and that the statute of limitations barred collection. The court applied the federal three-part inquiry, placing the focus of the inquiry on substance over form and found that (1) W. Va. Code &sect; 11-15-17 (1978) facially authorized the imposition of personal liability; (2) imposing such liability was not arbitrary or capricious or unreasonable; (3) a choice of a particular term to describe a corporate officer's connection with the payment of sales taxes--duty, wilfulness, or responsibility--was not constitutionally compelled; (4) the officer was directly involved with the business on a daily basis, was being paid for his bookkeeping services with tax money paid by customers and held in trust by the business to be remitted to the State, and was directly responsible for computing and sending in the taxes; and (5) he did not resign or report the wrongdoing once he knew that the law was not being complied with. W. Va. Code R. &sect; 110-15-4a.7.1 (1993) did not bar collection of the unpaid taxes because collection could occur within a reasonable time once taxes were assessed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff doctor sought review of two orders entered by the Circuit Court of Mason County (West Virginia), one of which dismissed the doctor's medical malpractice suit against defendant urologist for failure to comply with the West Virginia Medical Professional Liability Act (MPLA), W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-1 et seq., and the other of which denied the doctor's motion for reconsideration under W. Va. R. Civ. P. 60(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor was being treated by the urologist for kidney stones When the urologist performed a cystoscopy to remove a temporary stent, the doctor claimed that he was injured during the procedure. When the doctor filed his pro se action, the doctor asserted that a certificate of merit was not required under W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-6(c) (2003) (Supp. 2007) because he believed that expert testimony was not needed to demonstrate the breach of the standard of care. In a per curiam opinion, the court reversed the dismissal of the case while affirming the application of the MPLA. While the doctor's reliance on &sect; 55-7B-6(c) was in error due to the need for expert testimony based on the complexities of the underlying medical issues, the doctor had no way of knowing how the trial court would rule until it dismissed his case; the urologist also did not object to the doctor's statement in lieu of the certificate of merit until the urologist filed his motion to dismiss. Therefore, the doctor was never given an opportunity to correct his error based on good faith reliance. Thus, the court granted the doctor 30 days to obtain a certificate of merit in compliance with the MPLA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision insofar as it found that the MPLA was applicable but reversed the dismissal of the action. The court remanded the matter to afford the doctor 30 days to secure a certificate of merit and for further consideration consistent with the instant opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a patient and another individual, filed an action against appellee university hospital corporation. The Circuit Court of Monongalia County (West Virginia) reduced a jury verdict to $1 million under W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-8 (1986). It denied appellants' motion under W. Va. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During surgery at appellee's hospital, the patient allegedly developed a serratia bacterial infection. Appellants argued that the cap on damages did not apply because their claims arose out of environmental conditions at the hospital and thus did not fall under the Medical Professional Liability Act (MPLA), W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-1 et seq. The court held that judicial estoppel precluded appellants from now arguing that the claims were not governed by the MPLA. Appellants had pleaded, developed, argued, and submitted their claims to the jury as governed by the MPLA. They did not take the position that their claims were not governed by the MPLA until after a verdict in excess of the MPLA's noneconomic damages cap was returned and the verdict reduced. Appellants had benefited from taking their original position, for by characterizing their claims as medical negligence claims, they were able to attempt to invoke strong emotional responses and a sense of authority from the jury. Finally, by not characterizing their claims as premises liability claims until after the jury verdict was rendered, appellants precluded appellees from developing a theory of defense on this theory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four consolidated cases, petitioners, consisting of a city and other various interested parties (city), sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, the county commission, its members, and the county clerk (county), to enter two annexation orders incorporating certain parcels of land into the corporate limits of the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented was whether a county commission had authority to refuse to enter an annexation order presented to it by a municipality pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 8-6-4. In light of this issue, the city asserted that once it determined that the annexation petition was sufficient and forwarded it to the county commission, the commission had to enter the annexation order. In contrast, the county asserted that the proposed annexation was not reasonable, and that the city failed to comply with the required law, and thus, it had no duty to enter the annexation order. The appeals court held that under the clear and unambiguous language of W. Va. Code &sect; 8-6-4(g), the county commission was required to enter the annexation order when the municipality certified that the annexation petition was sufficient. Hence, the court rejected the commission's argument that it had a duty to determine whether or not the annexation complied with the applicable statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patients filed a putative class action suit against defendants, including two hospitals, alleging product liability, consumer protection, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims. The suit was removed to the federal court, and was remanded to the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia). The hospitals' joint motion to dismiss was granted. The state's highest court remanded the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court again granted the hospitals' joint motion to dismiss. The patients' petition for appeal was granted. The case arose out of the implantation of contaminated sutures in the patients. The case was dismissed due to the patients' failures to provide pre-suit notices and certificates of merit and to plead mandatory elements of a West Virginia Medical Professional Liability Act (MPLA), W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-1 et seq., action. The state's highest court held that sutures were implanted during the course of and in furtherance of medical treatment. The patients received health care services and the complaint revolved around an integral part of the health care services rendered. The MPLA applied to any liability for damages for any tort or breach of contract based on health care services rendered. The fact that the patients' claims were labeled as &quot;products&quot; claims did not change the fundamental basis of the tort action. The suit was governed by the MPLA. However, the suit was filed before Gray warned plaintiffs to adhere to the MPLA in close cases. Thus, the patients were afforded the opportunity to amend their complaint and to otherwise comply with the MPLA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed insofar as it found that the claims alleged against the hospitals had to be asserted under the MPLA. The dismissal of the claims was reversed. The case was remanded to afford the patients the opportunity to amend their complaint and to otherwise comply with the MPLA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that he developed debilitating depression and migraines while working for the employer, a state agency. The employee's claims under the Workers' Compensation Act (Act), W. Va. Code &sect; 23-1-1, et seq., were denied because the claimed injury was precluded by W. Va. Code &sect; 23-4-1f (1993) as a mental-mental injury. The employee's two federal cases seeking compensation from the employer were also dismissed. The employee argued that the legislature did not grant the employer immunity from mental-mental claims. In denying the writ, the court found that the employee failed to show a clear right to relief or to show a legal duty on the part of the employer. An employee who was precluded by &sect; 23-4-1f  from receiving workers' compensation benefits for a mental injury without physical manifestation could not, because of the immunity afforded employers by W.Va. Code &sect; 23-2-6 (1991), maintain a common law negligence action against his employer for such injury. The employer did not fail to comply with the Act and did not intentionally cause the employee's injury. Thus, it did not lose its immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner filed a pro se habeas corpus action, seeking relief from his sentence as enhanced under W. Va. Code &sect; 61-11-18 (2000). The Circuit Court of Raleigh County (West Virginia) summarily denied all habeas corpus relief pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect;53-4A-3 (1971). The prisoner appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence initially imposed was illegal as it did not comport with W. Va. Code &sect; 61-11-18 (2000) and W. Va. Code &sect; 61-11-19 (1943), i.e., it did not impose a mandatory life sentence after the prisoner was convicted as an habitual offender. Since the sentence was illegal at the onset, the trial court had a duty to correct it. The requirements of W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 61-11-18 and 61-11-19 did not give way to the enhancement provisions of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-4-408 (1971), given the prosecuting attorney's discretion in seeking recidivist enhancements, the rarity of the filing of such informations, and many of the offenses under the Act were relatively minor. Moreover, the controlled substances enhancements did not take precedence over the recidivist enhancements as the statutes could be reconciled. Finally, the trial court properly applied W. Va. R. Crim. P. 35(a) to change the prisoner's sentence where the State filed a timely recidivist information based on his two prior felony convictions, he admitted the allegations in the information, and once that procedure was complete, the trial court had no authority but to impose a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to the issues presented in the appeal, but was remanded on all other issues identified in the prisoner's pro se petition for appointment of counsel and further proceedings on all issues not decided in the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia) found that it had the discretion to waive the statutory notice required in actions governed by W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 55-17-1, et seq. (2002), and to stay proceedings for thirty days to allow for compliance with statutory provisions when an action is filed without the required pre-suit notice. Hence, certified questions arose as to whether it indeed had such discretion, and this matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that because the landowners' argument regarding definition of &quot;judgment&quot; in the Procedures for Certain Actions Against the State Act was not arguably within the scope of the questions certified, was not raised before the circuit court, and did not raise constitutional issues, it was not addressed. But, after the court reformulated the certified questions, it held that: (1) compliance with the pre-suit notification provisions set forth in W. Va. Code &sect; 55-17-3(a) (2002) was a jurisdictional pre-requisite for filing an action in accordance with W. Va. Code &sect; 55-17-1, et seq. (2002) against certain State entities, in light of the principles of sovereign immunity; and (2) an action dismissed for failure to comply with the notice provisions of W. Va. Code &sect; 55-17-3(a) (2002) could be re-filed after expiration of the original statute of limitations pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 55-2-18 (2001). Further, the court found that to accept the circuit court's opinion that it had discretion to waive this mandatory notice would require the instant court to judicially repeal W. Va. Code &sect; 55-17-3(a), which it would not do.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was reversed, and the certified questions were answered in the negative. Thus, dismissal was mandated for the failure to comply with the pre-suit notice provisions set forth in W. Va. Code &sect; 55-17-3(a).</SPAN></P>

The trial judge abandoned his role of impartiality and neutrality in propounding questions that betrayed to the jury that the trial judge had concluded that the physical evidence was in fact a clandestine drug lab, an ultimate question for the jury. The trial judge's questioning of defendant's wife also betrayed to the jury that the judge had formed a negative opinion of defendant and had formed an opinion as to defendant's guilt. The judge's conduct weighed in favor of the State's case to the point that the judge's partiality became a factor in the determination of the jury to such an extent that defendant not receive a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the conviction and sentencing order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court did not commit plain error in failing to instruct the jury on the defense of unconsciousness or automatism where appellant had focused at trial on the reasonableness of his decision to leave the child in the car, he was aware of his exhaustion and the fact that he was the only adult present to take responsibility for his son, and as the child's parent, he had a duty to exercise a minimum degree of care for the child. Thus, appellant had contributed to the circumstances in which his son's death was foreseeable. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give a requested instruction on &quot;neglect&quot; where the offense language was incorporated in the instructions, the W.Va. Code &sect; 61-8D-1(6) (1988) definition of neglect was included, and the jury was told that the word &quot;unreasonable&quot; meant unwise, senseless, or not rational. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction where a jury could have reasonably concluded that the death was foreseeable and preventable and appellant's actions and awareness of his exhaustion contributed to the circumstances that led, inexorably, directly to the child's death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant private hunting club and others sued appellee county commission, alleging that by holding an election under W. Va. Code &sect; 20-2-5(28) (2001), the commission had violated several constitutional provisions. The Circuit Court of Ritchie County (West Virginia) entered a declaratory judgment finding that the statute was constitutional. The hunting club and others appealed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court properly rejected the contention that the statute violated W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 22, because that constitutional provision preserved the state's right, through its police power, to enact reasonable laws defining the lawful forms of hunting. The prohibition of Sunday hunting on private land was not an unreasonable restriction of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 22, rights as it allowed citizens to enjoy private land one day a week. The statute did not unconstitutionally delegate the legislature's power to regulate hunting to the citizens of the various counties as case law did not preclude local option elections when a constitutional right was implicated. Moreover, W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, did not prevent the legislature from passing a law, and then providing that whether or not the law was to operate in a particular locality depended upon the popular will as expressed through a local election. There was no evidence that a county voter was misled or confused by the ballot language. Finally, the statute did not violate equal protection as it bore a reasonable relationship to the purpose of managing the state's wildlife resources.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the audio and video recording should have been suppressed because the evidence was obtained by an informant acting under the color of law without a court order. The court agreed and, overturning caselaw to a degree, held that, because the police failed to obtain judicial authorization to send the informant into defendant's home while the informant was wearing an electronic surveillance device, such intrusion violated the protection against unreasonable searches and seizures set forth in W. Va. Const. art. 3, &sect; 6. Consequently, the trial court should have granted defendant's motion to suppress the electronic surveillance recordings obtained and, insofar as defendant entered the conditional plea of guilty, conditioned on challenging the audio and recording evidence, defendant was entitled to exercise his right to withdraw the guilty plea and let a jury decide his fate on remand.</SPAN></P>

Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's complaint sought injunctive relief, with appellant specifically requesting W. Va. Code &sect; 18-9A-11 (2004), and its related provisions, to be deemed unconstitutional and to permanently enjoin appellees from including in its calculation of the county school board's local share the tax receipts that were annually diverted to the library pursuant to a special act, 1957 W. Va. Acts 178. Appellants asserted that W. Va. Code &sect; 18-9A-11 (2004), and its related provisions, along with the special act, created a discriminatory classification of appellant within the State's public school financing system, in violation of the State's equal protection clause. The court held that W. Va. Code &sect; 18-9A-12 (1993), to the extent that it failed to provide that appellant's allocated state aid share shall be adjusted to account for the fact that a portion of appellant's local share was required by law to be used to support a non-school purpose, violated equal protection principles because it operated to treat county school boards required by law to provide financial support to non-school purposes less favorably than county school boards with no such requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order and held that the statutory funding scheme at issue violated equal protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Circuit Court of Cabell County (West Virginia) for second degree robbery and his subsequent sentence to life with mercy as a recidivist. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the indictment was insufficient and that a custodial statement should have been suppressed because he was not promptly presented before a magistrate following his arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that while the indictment purported to charge first degree robbery, it did not. Because he did not present a firearm or other weapon in the commission of the crime, he contended that he could not be charged with first degree robbery under W. Va. Code &sect; 61-2-12. The appellate court held that the indictment did not substantially follow the language of &sect; 61-2-12 or fully inform defendant of the particular offense with which he was charged as it purported to charge first degree robbery while in substance charging, at most, second degree robbery. The indictment was so defective as not to charge an offense under West Virginia law. Thus, it made no difference when the objection to the indictment was made because such a challenge could not be waived. Though the motion in arrest of judgment was not timely under W. Va. R. Crim. P. 34, the defects in the indictment were such that they could not be ignored on the basis of a technicality such as timeliness. Defendant produced no evidence that the delay in his presentment was for the purpose of obtaining a statement. Moreover, his statement was not a confession as he maintained his innocence throughout the interview.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank appealed the denial of a tax refund for two years by appellee, the Tax Commissioner of the State of West Virginia. The West Virginia Office of Tax Appeals ruled for a tax refund. The Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia) reversed the Office of Tax Appeals by ruling that imposition of West Virginia's business franchise tax and corporation net income tax on the bank did not violate the Commerce Clause. The bank appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank, which was a foreign corporation that had its principal place of business and commercial domicile in Delaware, had no real or tangible personal property and no employees located in West Virginia. The principal business of the bank was issuing and servicing credit cards. The bank promoted its business in West Virginia via mail and telephone solicitation. The state supreme court found that the physical-presence requirement for showing a substantial nexus for the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, applied only to use and sales taxes and not to business franchise and corporation net income taxes. Further, the bank's systematic and continuous business activity in West Virginia was sufficient to meet the substantial nexus prong of the test for determining whether a state tax violated the Commerce Clause. Thus, West Virginia's imposition of the West Virginia Business Franchise Tax, W. Va. Code &sect; 11-23-1 et seq., pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 11-23-5a(d) (1996), and the West Virginia Corporation Net Income Tax, W. Va. Code &sect; 11-24-1 et seq., pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 11-24-7b(d) (1996), on the bank for two years did not violate the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband, individually and administrator of his wife's estate, sent a pre-suit notification and screening certificate of merit to defendant doctor. Thirty-one days later, the husband proceeded to file a medical malpractice suit, naming the doctor as one of the defendants. The Circuit Court of Greenbrier County (West Virginia) granted the doctor's motion to dismiss pursuant to W. Va. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), (6). The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband argued that the trial court incorrectly determined that dismissal was required because the husband failed to adequately comply with the pre-suit notice of claim requirements of the Medical Professional Liability Act. The supreme court of appeals held that trial court erred in dismissing the suit because the husband complied with the express statutory notification process in W. Va. Code &sect;&nbsp;55-7B-6 (2001), which required that the notice be served by certified mail, return receipt requested, 30 days prior to the filing of a medical professional liability action. The supreme court of appeals found that the husband complied with the plain meaning when the husband mailed the notification package by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the doctor's place of work 31 days prior to filing the instant action. The supreme court of appeals also concluded, however, that the legislature intended that a health care provider be given 30 days to evaluate a claim and in which to assert his or her statutory right to invoke pre-suit mediation in order to resolve the claim.</SPAN></P>

Due process demanded that an accused not routinely be compelled to appear in jail or prison clothing at the penalty phase of a bifurcated murder trial. However, since the error did not affect the finding of guilt, it was not necessary to require an entirely new trial, rather than to require a limited trial on the recommendation of mercy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed for a refund of the coal production severance tax, and the Commissioner denied the refund. The taxpayer failed to properly file a petition with the OTA. At the same time other coal companies had challenged the coal production severance taxes that they had paid, in U.S. Steel II, and because of a procedural error on the part of the Commissioner, these companies were found to be entitled to refunds. The taxpayer had not filed a petition in U.S. Steel II, but subsequently sought to be included with the other companies in U.S. Steel II. The OTA determined, upon motion from the taxpayer, that the taxpayer's petition would be considered as timely and included in the proceedings in U.S. Steel II. The lower court upheld the OTA's ruling when the Commissioner challenged it. Reversing, the court held that the taxpayer was not entitled to relief from the consequences of its failure to file a timely petition for a tax refund with the correct tribunal, as required by W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 11-10-14 and 11-10A-9. The court would not afford the taxpayer equitable consideration to enforce a forfeit against the State.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Boone County (West Virginia) concluded that an employee who was precluded from receiving workers' compensation benefits under W. Va. Code &sect; 23-4-1f could bring a common law negligence action against his employer and certified the question to the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">W. Va. Code &sect; 23-4-1f did not evince an intention by the legislature to affect any type of claims other than workers' compensation claims given that the legislature was fully aware of judicial precedent representing a transition from earlier caselaw requiring that a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress be accompanied by demonstrable physical injuries. Nevertheless, the statutory amendment was silent as to its effect on common law claims. The legislature intended that W. Va. Code &sect; 23-2-6 provide qualifying employers with a sweeping immunity from common-law tort liability for negligently caused work-related injuries. Thus, an employer that was otherwise entitled to immunity provided by W. Va. Code &sect; 23-2-6 could lose immunity in only one of three ways: (1) by defaulting in payments required by the Workers' Compensation Act or otherwise failing to be in compliance with the Act; (2) by acting with deliberate intention to cause an employee's injury as set forth in W. Va. Code &sect; 23-4-2(d); or (3) in such other circumstances where the legislature had by statute expressly provided an employee a private remedy outside the workers' compensation system.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Raleigh County (West Virginia) upheld a non-unanimous jury verdict for the doctor, based upon the non-unanimous verdict provision of the West Virginia Medical Professional Liability Act, W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-6d (Supp. 2004). The patient appealed after the denial of her post-judgment motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Louk v. Cormier, which held that &sect; 55-7B-6d was unconstitutional, was decided after the patient's post-judgment motions were denied, but before the patient noted her appeal. The state's highest court held that Ex Post Facto Clause due process concerns were inapplicable as ex post facto law only applied to criminal proceedings. The West Virginia Legislature was not permitted to enact statutes that were inconsistent with rules promulgated under the state's highest court's rule-making authority. Consequently, it was reasonably foreshadowed that &sect;&nbsp;55-7B-6d would have been invalidated. The Louk decision was a ruling on procedural matters and retroactive application of Louk was not outweighed by the possibility of affecting a large number of parties. The Louk decision was consistent with prior decisions. The Louk decision did not involve substantial public issues, but addressed only a narrow issue. Louk reaffirmed jury requirements that were longstanding under the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, the Louk decision was to be applied retroactively to cases pending in the trial court or on appeal to the state's highest court when Louk was decided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order denying a new trial was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court for a new trial consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted in the Circuit Court of Wood County (West Virginia) of two counts of sexual assault. The circuit court sentenced the inmate to two 15 to 25 year terms in the penitentiary under W. Va. Code &sect; 61-8B-3 (1984). The circuit court later denied the inmate relief in a habeas corpus proceeding, instituted under the West Virginia Post-Conviction Habeas Corpus Act, W. Va. Code &sect; 53-4A-1 et seq. (1967). The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that, inasmuch as his scheduled discharge date, based upon good time credit under W. Va. Code &sect; 28-5-27 (1984), would occur five years prior to his scheduled parole eligibility date under W. Va. Code &sect; 62-12-13(b) (1999) and W. Va. Code &sect; 62-12-13a (1955), his release upon good time effectively denied his right to be considered for parole, thereby violating principles of due process and equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. On appeal, the court found that, although the circuit court failed under W. Va. Code &sect; 53-4A-7(c) (1967) to properly consider the ground for relief the inmate advanced, his contention that his imprisonment was unconstitutional in terms of his parole consideration raised a legal issue framed within a given set of facts which the court could consider. The court noted that a release upon good time before the inmate's parole eligibility constituted neither an additional punishment nor an extension of the requirements for parole eligibility. As such, the court found that there was no deprivation of the inmate's rights to due process and equal protection and that his contention was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Commissioner of the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the enforcement of a portion of an order entered by respondent Fourteenth Judicial Circuit (West Virginia) (trial court) that ordered the Commissioner to cease the use of certain procedures in license revocation proceedings and directed the Commissioner to draft new procedures that were subject to the trial court's review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner argued that the trial court exceeded its authority under the West Virginia Administrative Procedures Act, specifically W. Va. Code &sect; 29A-5-4. The state's highest court noted that respondent drivers' appeals were brought under &sect; 29A-5-4. Section 29A-5-4 and prior case law unambiguously indicated that &sect; 29A-5-4 did not vest circuit courts reviewing administrative appeals of contested cases with the authority to order an agency to cease a certain practice or to direct an agency to promulgate new procedural rules that were subject to the circuit court's review. Rather, a circuit court's disposition of an administrative appeal was limited to affirming, remanding, reversing, vacating, or modifying the agency's disposition of a contested case. The trial court ordered what amounted to mandamus relief by seeking to compel the Commissioner to replace his procedural rules with new rules that were subject to the trial court's review. Just as &sect; 29A-5-4 did not authorize relief by way of an extraordinary writ, neither did it authorize the trial court to sua sponte order what was essentially extraordinary relief in its final order disposing of an administrative appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contempt order arose out of an abuse and neglect proceeding that evidenced specific staffing problems that the Child Protective Services unit was experiencing.

DHHR also argued that the trial court's contempt order exceeded the permissible scope of the subject order by mandating extensive staffing directives that were unrelated the subject case. The appellate court concluded that the inclusion of the staffing directives did not go beyond the cops of the predicate order. However, that appellate court noted that not all of the hiring-related directives were enforceable, as the trial court was without power to require the use of geographic pay differentials in its desire to immediately fill the vacate positions. The appellate court further determined that DHHR fully complied with the portions of the contempt ruling that were properly within its power and authority to act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the inmate was taken to see a nurse at a state corrections facility, he began to talk about sexual matters in a highly vulgar manner. When he concluded his sexual vulgarity, he reached over to the nurse and ran his hand over her breast. The nurse left the room and reported the incident. Subsequently, the inmate was charged with violating W. Va. Division of Corrections R. 1.03, which was entitled &quot;Rape.&quot; The inmate contended on appeal that he did not commit a rape of the nurse, as the title of the administrative rule stated, because there was no evidence of sexual penetration. On appeal, the court noted that the administrative rule was promulgated pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 28-5-27(f) (2004). The court found that it was the content of what was contained under the title of the administrative rule that was critical under the rule, not the title of the rule itself. Further, the content of the rule adequately informed the inmate of the conduct that was prohibited. Finally, some evidence was presented to establish that the inmate was engaged in conduct that was prohibited by the rule. Thus, the inmate's right to due process was not violated.</SPAN></P>

Va. Code &sect;&sect; 11-12B-3 (2000), 11-13A-3 (2002), 11-13A-6 (1997), 22-3-11 (2005), 22-3-32 (1994).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner collected CST from the companies based on their mining and processing of coal sold for export. The companies applied for refunds, claiming the taxes violated the Import-Export Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2. The commissioner denied the refunds. The circuit court affirmed that denial. On appeal, the companies raised the same constitutional challenge. The court found that the CST were substantially similar to other states' CST that were found constitutional by the United States Supreme Court, the CST statutes did not discriminate against coal exports, did not offend the policies underlying the Import-Export Clause, provided crucial state revenue that reflected the costs to the state from coal production, the specific tax-related activity that the companies argued most clearly implicated the Import-Export Clause were not clearly a part of the export transit process and comprised a de minimis portion of the coal's value for tax calculation, and the CST statutes did not, beyond a doubt, offend the United States Constitution. The CST statutes were constitutionally applied by the commissioner, so the refunds were properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were a son's biological mother and stepfather. Respondents were the deceased biological father's parents (grandparents). Petitioners requested that the stepfather be permitted to adopt the son and change the son's last name to the stepfather's name under the adoption statutes,&nbsp;W. Va. Code &sect; 48-22-701 et. seq. The Circuit Court of Roane County, West Virginia, allowed the adoption and disallowed the name change. Petitioners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the lower court erred by denying petitioner's request to change the son's surname incident to his adoption. The grandparents were entitled to, and did, receive notice of the adoption proceeding and become parties to it. Since all required parties were present and since the best interests of the child took precedence over whether petitioner's appeal was timely, the appeals court considered the case on the merits. The grandparents' desire that the son's surname not be changed from the biological father's surname did not take precedence over the desire of the fit mother who consented to the name change. The stepfather, as the adoptive parent, could, incident to the adoption proceeding, change the son's name to reflect the new adoptive relationship. In the case of the instant stepparent adoption, where the adoptive parent was married to the child's parent, the child's mother, as the parent, was required to, and did, assent to the proposed name change.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court determined that the lower court erred by refusing to permit the requested name change.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for domestic battery and kidnapping by the Circuit Court of Monongalia County (West Virginia). Defendant argued that his sentencing under W. Va. Code &sect; 61-2-14a (1999) violated his right to due process and trial by jury under the United States Supreme Court's decision in Blakely because the trial judge made a finding of fact that enhanced his punishment beyond the maximum amount allowed by the kidnaping statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the domestic battery and kidnapping of his girlfriend. The trial court found that defendant did not return his girlfriend unharmed and thus did not qualify for the sentences provided for in W. Va. Code &sect; 61-2-14a(3) and (4). Therefore, it sentenced defendant to life with mercy as recommended by the jury. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the kidnaping statute,&nbsp;W. Va. Code &sect; 61-2-14a. Defendant contended that the statute improperly permitted the trial court, rather than the jury, to make findings of fact that enhanced a defendant's sentence. The maximum sentence that defendant could receive based on the jury's findings was life with mercy, which was the sentence defendant received. Thus, defendant received no greater sentence than the statutory maximum. W. Va. Code &sect; 61-2-14a did not provide for the enhancement of a defendant's sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on additional facts found by the trial judge in violation of the constitutional right to a trial by jury as interpreted in Blakely. Accordingly, there was no constitutional error in defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia) upheld an ordinance adopted by defendant, a city, which authorized and established a city &quot;user fee&quot; on each individual who worked within the corporate limits of the city. Plaintiff, a worker, appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fee imposed a $1 per calender week &quot;city service fee&quot; on each individual who worked within the corporate limits of the city. The fee was intended to be used to pay for police protection, street maintenance, and public works projects. The worker argued that the fee was in fact an unlawful municipal capitation tax. The appellate court found that the trial court properly found that the fee was not in fact a tax. The plain language of the fee demonstrated that the fee would be exclusively used to provide police services and street maintenance related thereto. The worker also argued that the city violated notice procedures provided by W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 8-11-4 and 8-13-13(1971) in enacting the fee. The appellate court held that the city was in substantial compliance with the notice requirements. However, the appellate court found that the city may have prevented qualified voters from exercising their right to challenge the enactment of the ordinance by including an incorrect date for gathering signatures in protest. The appellate court ordered the city to hold an election on the issue of the fee to remedy that error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed insofar as it upheld the &quot;user fee&quot; as a fee and not a tax and concluded that the city had the authority to enact such a fee under applicable State statutes. The judgment was reversed to the extent that it upheld the City's failure to properly follow notice and publication requirements. The city was ordered to hold an election on the user fee ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The special master subsequently submitted his long-range plan; it primarily indicated that some critical steps had to be taken by the legislative and executive branches of state government. After some delay, the state supreme court held oral argument to address the extent to which the various components of the long-range plan had been implemented. The state supreme court then found there was no evidence that current conditions were resulting in unconstitutional deprivations to the inmates.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kanawha County Circuit Court (West Virginia) granted dismissal, in part, of an action commenced by appellant distributors to recover liquor licensing fees that they paid annually from 1982 to 2002, after they learned that W. Va. Code &sect; 60-4-18 (1935) prohibited a municipal corporation from imposing a fee or special tax as a condition upon the exercise of a state-issued liquor license. The distributors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributors contended that they were deprived of property without due process of law and that the city was negligent by collecting fees which were barred by W.Va. Code &sect; 60-4-18 (1935). The appeals court disagreed, as there were provisions for meaningful pre-deprivation relief including the opportunity to assert objections to the fee in an enforcement proceeding and the right to appeal that decision.  Moreover, the distributors could have refused to pay the fee and commence a challenge to the license requirement with a request for waiver of the penalties for nonpayment. However, they did not do so. Third, the city was clearly immune from liability for any negligence arising out its enactment of the ordinance requiring a liquor license fee and the administration and enforcement of that ordinance.  Further, the Tort Claims Act was not deemed inapplicable to the instant facts merely because the city had a special relationship with the distributors, as such did not exist. Finally, the city did not engage in wanton and reckless conduct by continuing to try to collect the liquor license fee after the instant suit was filed.</SPAN></P>

The jury instructions which permitted the jury to infer malice and intent where a defendant shot a victim with a firearm under circumstances not affording the defendant an excuse, justification, or provocation were valid. The supreme court of appeals also concluded the trial court sufficiently instructed the jury that the State had the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, each element of first degree murder, including malice, that the inmate was to be presumed innocent unless the State met its burden, and that the jury had to return a verdict of not guilty unless the State proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, each element of the charge of murder, including malice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Senate Minority Leader sought an extraordinary writ to compel the Governor to add certain language to his call on potential legislation in a special legislative session, pursuant to W. Va. Const. art. VII, &sect; 7, that was only just beginning, or to prohibit the Governor from using other language. The court refused to issue a writ of mandamus because the court, according to the separation of powers doctrine within W. Va. Const. art. V, &sect; 1, refrained from interjecting the judicial body into a potential dispute between the Governor and the West Virginia Legislature. Furthermore, the court chose not to issue an opinion because the opinion would then have been only an advisory opinion as the dispute under discussion was nothing more than anticipatory rhetoric at that time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents sued defendants, the West Virginia Secondary Schools Activities Commission (WVSSAC) and other school officials, contending their son had to be allowed to participate in interscholastic athletics notwithstanding his home-schooled status. The parents sought declaratory, equitable, and injunctive relief. The Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, issued writs of prohibition and mandamus; defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that in enacting W. Va. Code St. R. &sect; 127-2-3.1, which barred a home-schooled child from participating in interscholastic athletics, the WVSSAC violated W. Va. Code &sect; 18-8-1(c)(3) (2003), violated the home-schooled student's right to equal protection under W.Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10, and breached its duty to promulgate reasonable rules and regulations. The high court disagreed. The WVSSAC did not violate &sect; 18-8-1(c)(3) because that statute pertained to providing educational resources, not interscholastic sports resources, to a home-schooled student. As to the equal protection claim, there was no fundamental right to participate in interscholastic sports, and the WVSSAC had a rational basis for excluding home-schooled children from participating in interscholastic athletics: (1) promoting academics over athletics and (2) protecting the economic interests of the county school systems. Finally, as W. Va. Code &sect; 18-2-25 (2003) empowered the WVSSAC to regulate interscholastic athletic events, the WVSSAC did not exceed its statutory authority by promulgating a rule pertaining to the eligibility requirements for participating in such events.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By including accumulated unpaid vacation benefits in their final year of active employment, the pension benefits of the teachers would have been increased. However, W. Va. Code St. R. tit. 162, &sect; 8-5.4 prevented this practice. The teachers argued that W. Va. Code St. R. tit. 162, &sect; 8-5.4 was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that W. Va. Code St. R. tit. 162, &sect; 8-5.4 was reasonably designed to serve the legitimate governmental purpose of controlling the amounts paid in retirement benefits and to thereby ensure continued adequate funding of the Teachers' Retirement System. Thus, the rule was constitutional on its face. The rule was also constitutional as applied. The facts showed nothing more than an administratively less-than-perfect system and did not rise to the level of intentional, purposeful, or arbitrary discrimination that was offensive to equal protection. However, the teachers' retirement process had progressed sufficiently far by the time W. Va. Code St. R. tit. 162, &sect; 8-5.4 became effective that the legislative rule should not have applied to the calculation of the teachers' retirement benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow filed a medical malpractice case against defendant healthcare providers. The Circuit Court of Lewis County, West Virginia, dismissed the case under W. Va. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) because of alleged defects and insufficiencies in the widow's pre-suit notice of claim and screening certificate of merit, which she had submitted to the providers pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-6 (2003). The widow appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow alleged the providers were negligent in providing medical care and services to her husband during a pre-operative procedure. She provided one screening certificate of merit from an anesthesiologist for all of the providers rather than the required separate screening certificate of merit for each provider against whom a claim was asserted. Two of the providers did not respond. The other two asserted that there was a lack of detail about the standard of care but made no other criticism of the notice and certificate in their response. After suit was filed, three of the providers moved to dismiss based on alleged defects in the notice and certificate; the trial court granted the motion. The high court held that, assuming arguendo that the notice and certificate were deficient, the trial court erred in imposing the draconian sanction of dismissal because the widow had received no specific pre-suit notice of the alleged defects. Before a healthcare provider could challenge the legal sufficiency of a notice of claim or screening certificate under &sect; 55-7B-6, it had to give the plaintiff notice of, and an opportunity to correct, the alleged defects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's dismissal order was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient filed a medical malpractice action against appellee doctor in the Circuit Court of Randolph County (West Virginia). The jury returned a non-unanimous verdict against the patient. The circuit court ruled that the non-unanimous verdict provision of W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-6d (2004) was constitutional and denied the patient's motion for a new trial. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged that the doctor perforated the patient's cecum when he performed a hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy. The doctor defended the action on a theory that the cecum spontaneously ruptured. The patient contended that a non-unanimous verdict instruction should not have been submitted to the jury. The patient claimed that the non-unanimous verdict provision contained in W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-6d was a procedural rule that was in conflict with W. Va. R. Civ. P. 48 and was therefore invalid. The state supreme court addressed the issue, even though the patient did not object to the instruction at trial, because a constitutional issue was the controlling issue in the resolution of the case. The state supreme court found that the provisions contained in W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-6d were enacted in violation of the Separation of Powers Clause, W. Va. Const. art. V, &sect; 1, insofar as the statute addressed procedural litigation matters that were regulated exclusively by the state supreme court pursuant to the Rule-Making Clause, W. Va. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3. Consequently, W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-6d , in its entirety, was unconstitutional and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

The Council refused to grant approval due to safety of pedestrians, narrow streets ill-suited to a higher volume of traffic, and limited access of emergency vehicles due to narrow roadways. As a result, the seller and developer filed the instant action. The Council wrongfully withheld their approval until the seller and developer would agree to redirect ingress and egress of the subdivision to a different street. The Council failed to raise any valid concern that the submitted plat failed to depict the street and alley connections or that it would impede or prevent further development of the municipality pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 39-1-16 (2004). These were the only two possible grounds for withholding approval. While the Council retained the right to remedy traffic problems, this was not one of the statutorily-delineated bases under &sect; 39-1-16 for withholding its approval of a submitted plat.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State Tax Commissioner, challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Fayette County (West Virginia), which required the State to pay interest to appellee taxpayer on an overpayment of estate taxes. The overpayment had been promptly refunded to the taxpayer upon the taxpayer's request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a separate declaratory judgment action, the taxpayer settled a power of appointment issue, which was important regarding the calculation of the federal and state tax liabilities of the testatrix's estate. The taxpayer paid an estate tax in the amount of $ 3,622,102. After a settlement was reached in the declaratory action, the taxpayer successfully obtained a refund of the overpayment made. The court held that the trial court erred in concluding that the refund and interest provisions of W. Va. Code &sect; 11-10-14(a) (2003) and W. Va. Code &sect; 11-10-17 (2002) did not apply to estate taxes. The court further found that the first time the taxpayer made a proper claim for a refund was when it filed an amended tax return, which triggered the time period for which the Commissioner had to issue a refund without incurring interest. Because the Commissioner issued a refund within two weeks, interest was not due from the date of the overpayment. The court further held that the failure to pay interest on a refund from the date of the taxpayer's overpayment was not a taking under W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 9, because such taking provisions did not apply in the context of taxing statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue presented for the instant court's consideration concerned whether an administrative decision was rendered by the Tax Commissioner's Office of Hearings and Appeals or by the successor thereto, the Office of Tax Appeals. The Tax Commissioner argued that the circuit court erred in determining that the administrative decision rendered in favor of the taxpayers was issued by the Tax Commissioner. The taxpayers argued that the circuit court committed no reversible error in holding that the administrative decision was issued by the Tax Commissioner in accordance with the mandates of W. Va. Code &sect; 11-10-9(c) (2003). The instant court concluded that an administrative hearing had been held in the underlying case so as to render &sect; 11-10-9(c) dispositive of the matter. The Tax Commissioner, who did not render a timely decision on the refund requests, failed to comply with the plain statutory directives he was charged to execute and was not to be rewarded for his dilatoriness with the opportunity to appeal the adverse ruling on the merits. The administrative order was deemed to be one issued by the Tax Commissioner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Monongalia County (West Virginia) upheld the assessment of a use tax by respondent, the state department of revenue, against petitioner, a taxpayer, in connection with the taxpayer's out-of-state purchase of blasting materials that were subsequently used in West Virginia. The taxpayer appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's business was primarily the sale of explosive materials and blasting supplies, but secondarily included the direct use of those blasting materials by the taxpayer. The taxpayer was assessed use taxes on supplies purchased from out-of-state vendors, which were then used to perform blasting services in West Virginia. The taxpayer argued that it was entitled to an exemption for a producer of natural resources under W. Va. Code &sect; 11-15-9(b)(2) (2002). The court held that an individual or business entity who was not subject to the severance tax, but who sought exemption from the use tax of W. Va. Code &sect; 11-15-9(b)(2) (2002) based on its involvement in the production of natural resources, had to demonstrate that the sale or service for which exemption was sought was directly used within the production process. A further showing that such entity was engaged in one or more activities that constituted the act or process of producing natural resources within the meaning of applicable statutory and regulatory provisions, W. Va. Code &sect; 11-15-9-2(t), 110 W. Va. R. Taxation &sect; 15.123.4.3, was also required. The taxpayer's blasting activities came within this standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cemetery association and others (association) sought review of the decision of the West Virginia Public Service Commission. At issue was the price schedule established by the Commission that limited the prices that cemeteries could charge for the installation of grave markers for deceased veterans. The association claimed that W. Va. Code &sect; 24F-1-1 et seq. was an unconstitutional delegation of the West Virginia Legislature's authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">W. Va. Code &sect; 24F-1-1 et seq. authorized the Commission to regulate the installation of certain markers that the United States Veterans Administration provided free of charge to the families of qualified veterans. The Commission arrived at the rates after publishing a notice in newspapers throughout the state and serving notice upon the Division of Veteran Affairs and the association. The Commission had a single hearing and heard testimony from several groups. The Commission published the proposed rules in newspapers throughout the state, provided them to the Secretary of State's Office, and served them on several interested parties. The court determined that &sect; 24F-1-1 contained adequate guidance to the Commission. However, the Commission failed to follow proper procedures in creating the fee schedule at issue as the notice of hearing suggested that affected parties would have more than one opportunity to provide testimony and evidence regarding the proposed rules. In addition, the one hearing had some obvious shortcomings as no testimony was taken under oath and the association did not have the opportunity to cross-examine those who spoke at the hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held the statute was constitutional. The court ordered the Commission to hold a new hearing within 180 days.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a Kanawha County Circuit Court (West Virginia) order, which dismissed workers' compensation fraud charges against defendant after finding that her prosecution by a workers' compensation agency attorney appointed as an assistant prosecutor pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 7-7-8 (2003) violated due process. The State also sought a writ of prohibition, challenging the portion of the order abolishing the practice of such appointments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because &sect; 7-7-8 permitted prosecutors to appoint assistant prosecutors, an informal practice developed of appointing lawyers employed by the agency to prosecute workers' compensation fraud cases. The trial court had found that because the agency was at least the nominal victim of defendant's alleged offense, the appointed prosecutor had a conflict of interest that deprived defendant of due process. It dismissed the indictment. The high court held that because the indictment had not been dismissed merely as deficient, the State could not appeal the action under W. Va. Code &sect; 53-5-30 (Supp. 2004). However, the State was entitled to a writ of prohibition because the trial court had exceeded its jurisdiction in dismissing the indictment in the absence of any showing that the prosecutor, appointed in accordance with &sect; 7-7-8, had any actual conflict of interest. If defendant could show such a conflict, she could seek disqualification, but the practice was not unconstitutional as a matter of law. To assure prosecutorial fairness, however, the court directed the agency to develop a written policy to assure that employment by the agency did not influence the manner of prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal but granted the relief sought in the appeal when it granted the writ. The extraordinary relief was moulded, however, to direct the agency to develop a written policy covering such assignments, to assure prosecutorial independence of the employing agency and to permit defendant to raise particular challenges to the prosecutor's fairness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioner, a convicted sex offender, completed probation, he sought the restoration of certain civil rights that had been forfeited as a result of his felony conviction, including his right to possess firearms. Over respondent State's objections, the Circuit Court of Grant County, West Virginia, ruled that petitioner was eligible to have his right to possess firearms restored pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 61-7-7. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's guilty plea to felony third degree assault stemmed from his romantic relationship with a 15-year-old girl when he was in his early 20s. The trial court applied former W.Va. Code &sect; 61-7-7 (1989); the appellate court held that W.Va. Code &sect; 61-7-7 (2000) applied, and clearly prevented a felony sexual offender such as petitioner from restoring his rights to possess firearms. As &sect; 61-7-7 was a regulatory, not a punitive, statute, and did not increase the punishment for the enumerated offenses, applying the amended version did not violate the state or federal constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, para. 3, and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 4, respectively. The firearm restrictions in &sect; 61-7-7 did not violate W.Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 22 or the Second Amendment, as it was a proper exercise of the legislature's police power to protect the citizenry and impose reasonable limitations on the right to keep and bear arms to achieve this end. As W. Va. Code &sect; 61-7-7 did not increase the punishment for the crimes referenced therein, it did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under either U.S. Const. amend. VIII or W.Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought to prevent the issuance of general obligation bonds, which were to be credited to three public retirement systems under the Act, and to have the Act declared unconstitutional as a violation of W.Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 4. The Act provided for the redemption of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of each pension system. The trial court had upheld the constitutionality of the Act, finding that the exception to W.Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 4 for a &quot;previous liability of the State&quot; applied. On appeal, the court held that the Act was not within the exception to the constitutional prohibition against the State's incurring of a debt. The court noted that an obligation to fund was not the equivalent of a &quot;previous liability&quot; within the meaning of the constitutional debt clause. It was also noted that the three pension systems to be funded were actuarially sound, and that there had been no default in pension payments that would have given rise to the creation of an enforceable sum specific indebtedness. Accordingly, it concluded that such a funding mechanism would have required approval by the citizens through a constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer asserted that the Board erred by not applying the standard of W. Va. Code &sect; 23-4-1g (2003) with regard to a claimant's case. The employer asserted that the 2003 amendment to &sect; 23-4-1g eliminated the use of the &quot;rule of liberality&quot; in the interpretation of evidence and would have required a denial of benefits to one of its employees for an alleged occupational injury due to repetitive actions while processing chickens. The court disagreed and held that the claimant in that case presented evidence of her work-related injury with the understanding that the evidence was examined in light of the liberality rule, which was in effect at the time of the injury. The court further held that the 2003 amendments to &sect; 23-4-6(e)(1) clearly applied to any award made on or after July 1, 2003. As such, the Board did not err in affirming the decisions of the West Virginia Workers' Compensation Division that applied the 2003 amendments to the awards applicable to the eight claimants and the occupational pneumoconiosis claimant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Board's decision with regard to the employer, denied the eight claimants' request for mandamus, and denied the occupational pneumoconiosis claimant's request for a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Tyler County (West Virginia) of carrying a concealed and deadly weapon after allegedly violating the terms of his pretrial diversion agreement by not providing proof that he had performed the community service required by that agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant provided no affidavits showing he did the required community service, he was tried and convicted in the magistrate's court and, on appeal, in the circuit court, after his motions to suppress and to dismiss because he had already been punished were denied. Under the logic of W. Va. Code &sect; 61-11-22(c) (2001), which was inapplicable to the offense, when a person charged with a criminal offense successfully complied with a pretrial diversion agreement, the State could not prosecute him for the offense, or the underlying conduct, absent his agreement to plead guilty or nolo contendere to a related offense. The trial court abused its discretion in not either accepting defendant's evidence of completion of the required community service, or giving him another chance to prove he completed it. It could not be found that defendant satisfied his pretrial diversion order. While the order did not require affidavits as proof the community service was done, it was not unreasonable for the State to require some proof it was done. It was appropriate to grant defendant one last chance to prove he completed his community service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was reversed, and the matter was remanded with directions that the prosecutor's office would demand in writing what evidence of the completion of community service it found satisfactory, and defendant would have 30 days from the receipt of that demand to produce such evidence. If he did not, the trial court was directed to impose the sentence previously determined.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Attorney General filed a consumer protection action against the corporation and its president, who ran a &quot;free gasoline&quot; scam in several states. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the State. On appeal, the president argued that the trial court erred and violated his due process rights when it granted summary judgment in favor of the Attorney General without proper notice to him and without giving him time to speak with an appointed guardian ad litem. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that although the trial court gave appellants seven days' notice of its preliminary hearing instead of the nine provided under W. Va. R. Civ. P. 6(d), which was permitted under the specific terms of the rule, appellants' argument that the two-day reduction caused prejudicial surprise strained reason. The court noted that appellants were charged with consumer fraud in two other states and were represented by counsel. Lastly, the court found that it appeared from the record that appellants had no meritorious defense to present to the trial court, nor did there appear to be a material issue of fact in dispute, so summary judgment in favor of the State was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a former employee, filed suit against defendant, a town, asserting a claim under the West Virginia Whistle-Blower Law, W. Va. Code &sect; 6C-1-1 et seq. Following a jury verdict of money damages in favor of the employee, the employee made a motion for a post-trial injunction requiring the town to reinstate her to her former job. The Circuit Court of Monroe County (West Virginia) denied the motion, and the employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee claimed that her termination was caused or contributed to by her reporting of significant water losses in the town's public water system. The jury awarded the employee $ 16,000 for back pay, and nothing for future damages known as front pay or for mental distress. The appellate court found that the remedies set forth in W. Va. Code &sect; 6C-1-5 (1988) of the Whistle-Blower Law were reinstatement of the employee, the payment of back wages, full reinstatement of fringe benefits and seniority rights, actual damages, or any combination of these remedies. The issue of ordering reinstatement for a prevailing plaintiff was an equitable decision that was committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and not the jury. The appellate court could not conclude that the trial court erred in not awarding reinstatement to the employee. The appellate court found it significant that the jury did not award any front pay to the employee. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, a plausible reading of the jury's verdict was that the employee was not entitled to have kept her former job up until the time of trial, much less after trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted petitioner on one count of third-degree sexual assault for having had anal intercourse with a minor boy.

Rule 60(b) motion, and a petition for DNA testing in the circuit court, which was denied on the basis of res judicata, and he did not appeal. Subsequently, he filed another motion for DNA testing that was also denied because it was &quot;nearly identical&quot; to his prior motion, and he likewise did not appeal. Denying petitioner's request for mandamus, the court held that (1) petitioner directed the court to no authority mandating that the State conduct, or that he should be allowed to conduct, DNA testing when he was not incarcerated; and (2) the petition was barred by res judicata based on the prior res judicata determinations that were never appealed. However, the court took the opportunity to encapsulate the requirements to award post-conviction DNA testing and outlined the requirements that a petitioner was required to establish before obtaining relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an individual who was pardoned by the Governor of West Virginia, filed an action against defendant Brooke County (West Virginia), seeking a judgment declaring that the Governor's pardon restored various rights to him. The Circuit Court of Brooke County (West Virginia) asked the state supreme court to determine if the individual had to comply with W. Va. Code &sect; 61-7-7 (2000) before he could possess a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An individual was convicted of two counts of malicious wounding in 1992, after he shot another person with a firearm and struck the other person with an automobile. The individual was sentenced to a term of not less than two nor more than 20 years' imprisonment, and he was released from prison and placed on home detention after he served one year. In November 1996, the Governor of West Virginia granted the individual an unconditional pardon. Almost three years later, the individual filed an action in the circuit court, seeking a declaration that the Governor's pardon restored certain rights, including his right to possess firearms. Brooke County contested the individual's claim that the Governor's pardon restored his right to possess firearms, and the circuit court asked the state supreme court to determine if the individual had to comply with W. Va. Code &sect; 61-7-7 (2000) before he could possess a firearm. The state supreme court held that &sect; 61-7-7 applied to all individuals who were convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, even when the individual received an unconditional pardon from the Governor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court answered by circuit court's question in the negative; i.e., it concluded that the individual who was pardoned by the Governor was not exempt from the state statute which required persons who were convicted of felonies to obtain approval from a circuit court before they possessed a firearm in West Virginia.</SPAN></P>

The coal company appealed to the Circuit Court of Raleigh County (West Virginia). The circuit court reversed and remanded the matter for a second show cause hearing. The DEP appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director of the DEP conducted the show cause hearing after he made statements in a press release about the coal company's prior violations. The coal company's license was suspended in the administrative proceedings because of its alleged pattern of violations of state surface mining regulations. Instead of addressing the substantive issues, the circuit court determined that the coal company's procedural due process rights were violated by virtue of the director serving as the hearing examiner in the show cause hearing. Further, the circuit court found that the coal company was denied a fair and impartial hearing based on the director's pre-hearing public statements in the press release and demonstrated knowledge of extra-record evidence. On appeal, the court found that the director could conduct the hearing. Further, by disregarding the critical distinctions between a show cause proceeding and an initial fact-gathering and issue determinative administrative hearing, the circuit court failed to appreciate both the narrow scope of the show cause hearing and the permissible nature of pre-hearing administrative involvement. Thus, there was no denial of procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

P. 35(b) motion requesting a reduction in sentence in the nature of a grant of probation so that he could pursue a rehabilitation program with a private religious organization. The Circuit Court of Pendleton County, West Virginia, denied the motion, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sexually assaulted his step-brother when he was a juvenile. He was placed on probation, which was revoked due to his use of marijuana and alcohol. He wanted to enroll in a nationally-acclaimed rehabilitation program that would teach him a skill and prepare him for independent living. The circuit court denied his motion for probation due to his failure to follow the conditions of probation in the past. The State argued that under the Youthful Offender Act, W.Va. Code &sect;&sect; 25-4-1 to -12, once probation was revoked, a circuit court lacked jurisdiction to again grant it. The supreme court of appeals disagreed, noting that under the West Virginia Constitution, court rules such as W.Va. R. Crim. P. 35(b) superceded state statutes. The circuit court abused its discretion in denying probation because (1) defendant was the victim of heinous sexual assaults, which caused him to act out sexually while he was a juvenile; (2) there was no evidence he was a sexual threat to anyone; and (3) his probation violations were based on substance abuse, not more serious misconduct. In view of his tender age and extreme victimization, he was entitled to a chance to salvage his life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to the circuit court with directions to grant defendant probation to follow the private rehabilitation plan, which had to include specific provisions that he undergo both sexual offender counseling and drug and alcohol abuse counseling.</SPAN></P>

The court found the sole issue presented was whether the statutory law delineating the manner in which prospective jurors should be selected allowed jurors to be selected in alphabetical order. The court found, first, that challenging the selection procedure by way of a writ of prohibition was the proper method. The court next found that the method of selecting prospective jurors in sequential alphabetical order was not sufficiently random to comply with the governing common law and statutory requirements mandating the random selection of prospective jurors. Moreover, the clerk's presiding circuit judge did not possesses the ability to establish his or her own rules pertaining to the jury selection process, with which the circuit clerk would then be obligated to comply. Therefore, the circuit judge's rule mandating sequential alphabetical selection was rejected and the writ was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant presented expert testimony that his capacity to premeditate, intend, and have malice was diminished when he shot the victim, but the trial court ruled he had to show he was incapable of such mental states at all before he could present evidence in support of a diminished capacity defense. The supreme court of appeals held the diminished capacity defense was available in West Virginia to permit a defendant to introduce expert testimony of a mental disease or defect rendering defendant incapable, at the time the crime was committed, of forming a mental state that was an element of the crime charged. The trial court erroneously applied the diminished capacity doctrine by requiring a complete inability to form the necessary mental elements of the crime. The testimony of defendant's expert that defendant was, due to a previous injury, unable, under the circumstances of the incident in which the victim was killed, to form an intent or malice or to premeditate was plainly sufficient to allow the expert to testify before a jury. The trial court was clearly wrong in excluding this evidence and prohibiting defendant from presenting a diminished capacity defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both employees had been awarded permanent total disability based on injuries suffered at work. One employee had his benefits cut off by letter which indicated that said benefits were being discontinued because the employee had reached the age of 65. The other employee received notice that his injuries made him eligible for such benefits, but indicated that he would receive no payments since he had already reached the age of 65. On appeal, the issue before the court was whether W. Va. Code &sect; 23-4-6 (1995) violated the Equal Protection Clause of the West Virginia Constitution, W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10, by terminating benefits for permanently and totally disabled workers simply because they reached age 65. The appellate court concluded that &sect; 23-4-6 did not violate W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10 because it created a classification that was a rational one based on social, economic, historic, or geographic factors and it bore a reasonable relationship to a proper governmental purpose, protecting the solvency of the workers' compensation fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offenders argued that, because the legislature amended the Act to require life registration and active disclosure of their status after they committed their crimes, application of these new requirements to the offenders violated the ex post facto clause of the West Virginia Constitution. The appellate court held that the application of W. Va. Code &sect; 15-12-4 (2000), which required life registration for certain sexual offenders, or W. Va. Code &sect; 15-12-5(1) (2001), which allowed for public dissemination of certain information about life registrants who were convicted before the legislature added the requirements, did not violate the ex post facto clause of the West Virginia Constitution. The Act was civil and nonpunitive in nature, and therefore, the changes did not amount to additional punishment that would have violated the ex post facto clause. Finally, the appellate court found no merit to the offenders' argument that the changes to the statute violated due process principles of the West Virginia Constitution because they subjected offenders to publication without making a determination that a particular offender posed a current risk to the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court of appeals found parts of the statute the group challenged, W. Va. Code &sect; 29-22-18a(d)(3) (Supp. 2002), contrary to the West Virginia Constitution. Attorney's fees could be awarded to a prevailing petitioner in a mandamus proceeding challenging a statute's constitutionality, in which the statute was found unconstitutional. The factors weighed in deciding if the group was entitled to attorney's fees were (1) the relative clarity by which the legal duty was established; (2) whether the ruling obtained promoted the general public interest or protected a private interest; and (3) whether the group had adequate financial resources to protect its interests. The group's suit sought to protect vast public interests, and its resources were sparse, so an award of attorney's fees was warranted. Citizens should not have to sue to prevent government officials from violating the state constitution. As the group did not prevail on all claims, apportionment of its attorney's fees was necessary. Its success rate was slightly less than 50 percent, but counsel's hourly rate was appropriate, given counsel's experience and the nature of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his sentence was disparate to the sentence imposed on the co-defendant. The appellate court held that defendant and the co-defendant pleaded guilty to different crimes, which carried different penalties. Defendant and the co-defendant were not similarly situated. Defendant was the last person with custody of the dogs, one of which was not found. Further, defendant released the dogs along a road in the middle of a snowstorm, instead of taking them to the owners' home. Defendant's sentence did not violate W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5. While defendant did not have a criminal history, the trial court considered the owners' testimony describing the anguish of searching for the dogs and how they were deeply impacted by the loss of the dog. Moreover, defendant was initially indicted for grand larceny for stealing hunting dogs and hunting paraphernalia worth approximately $ 2,500. Defendant's guilty plea to a lesser offense led to a sentence within the statutory guidelines. Defendant did not contend that the sentence was based upon any impermissible factors.

The Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia) enjoined another appellant local health board from enforcing a similar ordinance, and the board sought to dissolve the injunction by seeking a writ of prohibition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court of appeals held the regulations (1) were consistent with legislative findings on smoking dangers, (2) advanced a legislative policy of a tobacco-free society, and (3) were allowed by W. Va. Code &sect; 16-2-11. They took no property as they promoted a legitimate state interest and did not destroy all use of regulated property. Personal privacy was not infringed if they did not apply to exclusively private areas. Retail liquor licensees were subject to them, despite being &quot;private places,&quot; under W. Va. Code &sect; 60-7-1 (2000). Judicial review examined if (1) their methods reasonably related to a tobacco-free society; (2) they were arbitrary or unreasonable; and (3) they impermissibly invaded constitutional rights. A regulation's criminal penalty only recited a penalty in W. Va. Code &sect; 16-2-15. The regulations could not supersede W. Va.

Va. Code, &sect;&sect; 60A-7-701 to 60A-7-707 (1988). The individual appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual challenged the forfeiture order entered against him. The appeals court first held that in forfeiting property under W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-7-703(a)(6) (1988), the State was required to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a substantial connection between the property seized and the illegal drug transaction. This finding was in addition to the initial finding of probable cause that an illegal act under the drug law occurred. It was undisputed that the individual took $ 6,000 from the cashier's checks in his safe deposit box in order to purchase illegal drugs. The appeals court agreed that this fact alone provided direct evidence that there was a substantial nexus between the illegal drug-related activity and the money found in the safe deposit box. Furthermore, because the individual obtained a vast portion of cash from his safe deposit box in order to make an illegal drug purchase from an undercover agent, it was logical to conclude that the safe deposit funds were maintained for the individual's use in future illegal drug transactions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pled guilty to burglary; an indecent exposure charge was dismissed. The Circuit Court of Hardy County, West Virginia, denied defendant's request for probation, sentenced him to prison, found that the crime had been sexually motivated, and sua sponte ordered defendant to register as a sex offender pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 15-12-2(b) (2001). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evaluation of defendant provided to the circuit court showed that he suffered from voyeuristic sexual compulsions, and he admitted that the reason for his offense was the illegal entry of a house in order to take pictures of a girl. Defendant claimed that neither he nor his counsel was aware that the circuit court could or intended to make a finding that would classify defendant as a &quot;sex offender&quot; and require him to register as such. The appellate court found no evidence from the record that the circuit court made any advisement as to the possibility defendant could be adjudicated a sex offender. There was overwhelming evidence that the burglary for which defendant was convicted was &quot;sexually motivated&quot; under W. Va. Code &sect; 15-12-2(c). However, as burglary was not a sex offense that was enumerated in the Sex Offender Registration Act, W. Va. Code &sect; 15-12-1 (2001) et seq., the circuit court had been obliged to advise defendant, before allowing him to plead guilty, that if that court found his crime to be &quot;sexually motivated,&quot; defendant could be found to be a sex offender and be required to register. Defendant was therefore entitled to withdraw his plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to allow defendant to withdraw his plea. If he did not wish to withdraw his plea, his conviction and duty to register as a sex offender would be upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;W.Va. Code &sect; 29-22-18a(d) had been amended by the legislature after a prior court decision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding in prohibition, petitioners, the Commissioner of the West Virginia Bureau of Employment Programs and the West Virginia Workers' Compensation Division (relators), were awarded a rule against respondents, the Circuit Court of Mingo County and an employer, to show cause why they should not be prohibited from enforcing a temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relators argued that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to issue the restraining order barring the relators from withdrawing the employer's workers' compensation coverage for the delinquent payment of premiums and essentially lowering the employer's premium rate because the employer had not exhausted its administrative remedies. The state's highest court held that the administrative processes were not exhausted when the employer filed suit nor when the restraining order was issued. The employer challenged the reclassification and attendant premium rate increase through the administrative process as established in W. Va. Code &sect; 23-2-17 before it filed suit in the trial court, and the administrative remedy was not exhausted at the time of filing. In fact, following the denial of its reconsideration motion by the Commissioner but before the trial court issued its amended order, the employer continued to invoke the administrative process. Since concurrent jurisdiction was not statutorily prescribed, the trial court acted without subject matter jurisdiction, which rendered the order void. The temporary restraining order was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further agreed to make restitution to the victims in an amount to be determined at a restitution hearing. Following a hearing, the Circuit Court of Marion County (West Virginia) ordered restitution of $ 48,778. Defendant's request for reconsideration of the restitution order was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant embezzled from his employer using several methods. The trial court's restitution order included losses from several different categories. The State conceded that the trial court erred in assessing attorney and expert witness fees in the restitution order and in failing to make findings regarding defendant's ability to pay restitution. The appellate court held that the preponderance of the evidence standard set forth in W. Va. Code &sect; 61-11A-5 was not unconstitutional. There was no merit in defendant's contention that such items as stolen cash, cash received for the sale of an outbuilding, and additional checks allegedly written by defendant should not have been included as restitution. There was no error in allowing repayment of interest paid on the victim's line of credit. However, the issue of interest should have been revisited to ascertain whether the victim's decision to allow this interest to be incurred was a necessary result of defendant's criminal activity or a convenient but unnecessary decision by the victim. The trial court erred in awarding restitution for lost wages asserted by the victim incurred as a result of attendance at court proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Appellant employers sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 23-2-4 (2002), the Commissioner and the Compensation Programs Performance Council drafted a &quot;Risk Management Rule&quot; (Rule 9). Under Rule 9, employers were obliged to pay premiums increased in an amount dedicated to the &quot;amortization of discount&quot; -- i.e., the amount directed by the Commissioner and Council to be included in the workers' compensation premium tax rates for each employer in West Virginia for the purpose of effecting a perceived &quot;reduction of deficit&quot; in the Workers' Compensation Fund. The appeals court noted that in &sect; 23-2-4(a)(2), the legislature directed the Commissioner and Council to develop a rule establishing rates so as to reduce any deficit in the workers' compensation fund. Imposition on all employers of additional premium taxes to amortize the discount was not a prohibited retroactive charge imposed on employers subject to the workers' compensation laws. The premium tax increase did not violate the Due Process Clauses of the federal and state constitutions, as there was a rational basis underlying the measure, nor was it an undue taking without compensation under U.S. Const. amend. V or W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

Va. Code &sect; 46A-1-1 et seq., alleging that appellee check guarantee company was engaging in illegal, unfair, or deceptive acts or practices (UDAPs). The Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, denied the Attorney General's request for preliminary injunctive relief. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">If a store accepted a check guaranteed by the company that was later dishonored, the company would pay the store the amount of the check. The Attorney General alleged that the company kept consumers' names in its database when it knew or should have known that the consumers did not write bad checks, and engaged in other UDAP conduct. The instant court held that W. Va. Code 58-5-1 (1998) did not prohibit it from hearing an appeal from the denial of the Attorney General's request for a preliminary injunction, as the grant by W. Va. Const. art. 8, &sect; 3 to that court of appellate jurisdiction over civil cases in equity did not limit its power to review and correct error in cases in equity to &quot;final judgments.&quot; The issue before the trial court under W. Va. Code &sect; 46A-7-110 (1974) was whether there was reasonable cause to believe that the company was engaging in or was likely to engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices; if so, it could grant a preliminary injunction. Instead of applying this standard, it erred by basing its decision to deny a preliminary injunction on the issue of whether the attorney general had proved a &quot;pattern or practice&quot; of improper conduct by the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying preliminary injunctive relief was vacated and reversed, and the case was remanded for proceedings on the merits of permanent injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association challenged the manner in which the members of the Committee were appointed and the process by which the Committee selected and approved grant applicants. The supreme court found that the appointment mechanism for the Committee contained in W. Va.

Const. art. VII, &sect; 8. Further, based upon the lack of sufficient standards provided for the Committee's use in evaluating the submitted grant projects pursuant to the provisions of W. Va. Code &sect; 29-22-18a(d)(3), the West Virginia Legislature wrongfully delegated its powers, in violation of W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1. Due to these constitutional infirmities, the actions previously taken by the Committee with regard to approving various grant applications were of no force and effect. However, the statutory provisions of W. Va. Code &sect; 29-22-18a(d)(3), which governed the issuance of bonds and the repayment mechanisms were constitutional under W. Va. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 3 other defendants were allegedly driven to a convenience store, to engage in a robbery, in a rented car by the individual. The individual did not enter the store. He remained outside as a lookout. The other defendants entered guilty pleas to lesser charges in exchange for testifying on behalf of the state. The individual was sentenced to 50 years in prison and complained that his sentence of 50 years' imprisonment was excessive and disproportionate. The instant court concluded that, based upon the circumstances of the crime, including the violent nature of the robbery and the use of a weapon, the sentence imposed upon the individual did not shock the conscience of the court or society. However, the court was concerned with the disparate sentencing in the case in light of the individual's actual role in the crime. The state initially argued that it struck the juror, as he worked at the same company as the individual's father. Subsequent voir dire of the juror revealed that he did not work at the same company as the individual's father and that he did not know any member of the individual's family. Thus, the state unlawfully struck an African-American prospective juror.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insured sought declaratory relief as to her entitlement to underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits. The Circuit Court of Barbour County, West Virginia, granted her motion to convert the suit into a class action, denied her summary judgment motion, but granted summary judgment to appellee insurer on the grounds that, inter alia, W. Va. Code &sect; 33-6-30(b)-(c) (2002, Supp. 2002) barred the insured's cause of action. The insured appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the insured was riding in her car, which was covered by the insurer's policy and was being driven by her uninsured escort, she was injured in an auto accident. As the coverage limits of the policy did not fully recompense her injuries, she sought UIM benefits under the policy and under two other policies the insurer had issued to her spouse. The trial court held that the car had not been underinsured and that the policy provision barring the stacking of coverages was enforceable. The appellate court agreed. By the policy's definition, the insured's car could not be deemed underinsured; further, the anti-stacking exclusions were valid. The trial court erred in giving retroactive effect to &sect; 33-6-30(b)-(c), which overruled Mitchell v. Broadnax (which in turn had barred insurers from enforcing policy exclusions if they were not consistent with the premiums charged), since that statute was substantive and extinguished litigable rights. However, the trial court properly ruled that the insured lacked standing to assert a claim under Mitchell, since the policy was issued before that decision, and as Mitchell affected substantive rights, it would not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 27-5-2(a) (2002, Supp. 2002), which prohibited applications for involuntary hospitalization to be filed on behalf of incarcerated persons, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner stopped complying with his treatment program and became violent toward his mother and other family members. After petitioner's arrest, both his mother and a psychologist chosen by jail authorities -- who determined that petitioner was a threat to himself and others and required treatment unavailable at the jail-- tried to initiate an involuntary hospitalization proceeding so petitioner could be placed in a mental health facility. Respondent commissioner of the health and human resources bureau refused to accept either petition, based on &sect; 27-5-2(a). On appeal, the commissioner argued that &sect; 27-5-2(a) served the valid State interest in combating overcrowding of the mental health care facilities and in preventing inappropriate involuntary hospitalizations. The court held these purposes were not rationally related to the exclusion of pretrial detainees from involuntary hospitalization procedures. To the extent &sect; 27-5-2(a) prohibited applications for involuntary hospitalization to be filed on behalf of incarcerated persons, it was unconstitutional as it violated the due process right of such detainees to receive medical care from the state that detained them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a plea hearing, the trial court advised defendant that the maximum sentence he could receive was incarceration for two to six years.

Defendant contended that the circuit court committed a flagrant error by not prohibiting the State from proceeding on a recidivist trial. The supreme court found that (1) the circuit court did not error by informing defendant that he would only be facing a possible maximum sentence of two to six years--not the possibility of a life sentence as a recidivist; (2) the prosecuting attorney's failure to advise defendant at the hearing that the State would seek a recidivist enhancement did not violate W.

The trial court had denied defendant's motions to dismiss and to suppress. At the time of the conviction, defendant was serving a federal sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his case should have been dismissed for violation of the three-term rule in W. Va.

Defendant was promptly tried after his arraignment, and the State fully complied with the IADA. Defendant was not prejudiced by his absence at hearings held to determine whether he was still in federal custody, and to set a trial date to comply with the IADA. Defendant was not denied due process under W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 14. Defense counsel had an adequate time to prepare for trial. The case was promptly set for trial to accommodate defendant. Defense counsel stated that he did not want a continuance. The plea was entered freely and voluntarily. There was no error in the consecutive sentence under W. Va. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(2), although the trial court did not accept the State's recommendation of concurrent sentences or allow defendant to withdraw his plea of not guilty. Defendant's contention that he received a disparate sentence as his co-defendant was not prosecuted was rejected. Defendant and his co-defendant were not similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an enlisted member of the state Air National Guard. After he failed to attend required unit training assemblies without obtaining advance approval for his absence, he was progressively demoted in rank, and was ultimately charged with violation of &sect; 15-1E-87(b). The state supreme court in light of congressionally directed punishments for AWOL, &sect; 15-1E-87(b) could not stand scrutiny because the sole punishment provided by its terms was mandatory confinement in jail. Section 15-1E-87(b) was unconstitutional because it violated the militia clauses of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cls. 15, 16. In addition, it subjected defendant to trial in two separate tribunals of the same jurisdiction--a court-martial proceeding and also a trial in a civilian court--for the same offense.

The state supreme court refused to hear petitioner's arguments that the prosecutor's remark violated the plea agreement petitioner had with the State and that petitioner's counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor's remark. Petitioner made the same arguments in a petition for habeas corpus relief, but the trial court dismissed that petition. The state supreme court held that the prosecutor's remark did not violate the State's plea agreement with petitioner and that the trial court was not clearly wrong when it denied petitioner's request that he be appointed counsel to assist him with his habeas corpus action or when it dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the appellate court noted that, before trial, both defendant's psychiatrist and psychologist submitted reports to the court that indicated defendant was incompetent to stand trial. A principal finding made by defendant's experts was that he was not known to have spoken a word since his arrest. However, the trial court ruled that defendant was competent to stand trial. The appellate court believed defendant's competency hearing was deficient. Moreover, the appellate court's own independent review of the record showed the preponderating evidence demonstrated defendant's incompetency at the time of trial, inasmuch as his persistent mental state resulted in his inability to communicate with his lawyers. Accordingly, the appellate court found the trial court was clearly wrong in finding that defendant was competent to stand trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee purchaser petitioned the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, for a writ of mandamus commanding appellant deputy commissioner of delinquent and nonentered lands to refund money the purchaser paid for nonexistent or erroneously assessed properties at an auditor's sale, pursuant to former W. Va. Code &sect; 11A-3-53 (1994). The trial court granted the petition, and the deputy commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchaser did not learn that the properties it purchased from the deputy commissioner did not exist or had been erroneously assessed until it had received deeds to the properties. The purchaser duly filed a &quot;certificate of attorney-at-law&quot; requesting a refund, pursuant to former &sect; 11A-3-53, but the deputy commissioner refused to refund the purchase price on grounds that it could not do so once a deed had issued. On appeal, the deputy commissioner argued that former &sect; 11A-3-53 was so vague as to leave it with no clear legal duty, and that the purchaser's suit was untimely. The court disagreed. Former &sect; 11A-3-53 unambiguously imposed a duty on the deputy commissioner to issue refunds, and contained no time limit for a purchaser to request a refund. While the law presumed a reasonable time period for seeking a refund, that the purchaser waited eight months after delivery of the deputy commissioner's deed to file suit was not unreasonable under the facts of the case. Further, the record did not reveal any inequitable conduct by the purchaser that would operate as a bar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two appellant employees of two appellee employers suffered back injuries. The West Virginia Workers' Compensation Appeal Board reversed decisions of administrative law judges and made permanent partial disability awards under the Diagnosis-Related Estimate Model (DRE) of the American Medical Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fourth Edition (1993) (Guides). The employees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The West Virginia Workers' Compensation Division incorporated the Guides by reference into their rules under W. Va. Code &sect; 23-4-6(i) and equated an impairment rating conducted under the DRE to be equivalent to a disability rating for permanent impairment. The supreme court found it extremely important that the rules commanded a doctor to conduct the examination and compose the report in accordance with the Guides and not simply to use the models or suggestions contained in the Guides. The Guides mandated use of the DRE for most back injuries. The DRE's use for spinal injury evaluation conflicted with West Virginia statutes controlling: (1) the proper time for making an impairment rating; (2) the proper treatment of progressive injuries; (3) the procedure for reopening a claim; and (4) the consideration of a second injury. As the DRE for the examination of spine injury claims could not be reconciled with several specific workers' compensation statutes, any medical examination conducted in accordance with the DRE model was invalid and unreliable. The disability assessment was to be based on an assessment of medical and nonmedical information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding, petitioner Attorney General of the State of West Virginia sought a writ of mandamus that would order respondent executive branch officials to cease the employment of lawyers not employed or approved by the attorney general, arguing that the practice violated W. Va. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. Intervenor agencies argued for the propriety of the practice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General of West Virginia was one of the few offices established by name in the West Virginia Constitution. The official duties of office were described in great detail at W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 5-3-1, 5-3-2, but over the years, as State agencies proliferated, the legislature passed legislation permitting many of them to hire lawyers as their own employees or to retain outside counsel. The attorney general commenced a mandamus proceeding seeking to have the laws authorizing use or employment of counsel neither supervised by nor approved by him unconstitutional. The high court agreed that under the separation of powers principles of W. Va. Const. art. V, &sect; 1, the legislature was precluded from doing anything to diminish or avoid the constitutional powers of the attorney general. At the same time, endeavoring to interpret W. Va. Const. art. VII, art. 1, which defined those powers, so as to give them effect in the era of modern, complex government, it declined to outlaw the practice of public entities using other lawyers. It exhorted the parties to study the situation and work out a mutually respectful solution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ after moulding it to provide that use of their own lawyers by state agencies was not barred in all cases, directing all the parties to resolve their specific disagreements, if possible, with resolution in court as a last resort.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the board of trustees of a police officers' pension fund, filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant pensioner. The Circuit Court of Ohio County, West Virginia, granted the board's motion for judgment on the pleadings and ordered the pensioner to submit his tax returns to the board so it could determine whether he received excessive benefits under W.Va. Code &sect; 8-22-24(d) (1991). The pensioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the pensioner began working as a police officer in 1979, retirement and disability benefits were provided to police officers pursuant to W.Va. Code &sect; 8-22-24 (1971). He made all of the required contributions to the pension fund until 1996, when he was awarded a non-work-related disability pension. He later obtained other employment. The board wanted his tax returns to determine if a reduction in benefits was appropriate, since W.Va. Code &sect; 8-22-24(d), as amended in 1991, required the board to reduce the benefits of an officer disabled due to a non-work-related injury by $ 1 for every $ 3 of income earned in excess of $ 7,500 annually. The pensioner argued that amended &sect; 8-22-24(d) impaired the obligation of contract in violation of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 4. The appellate court agreed. Because the pensioner was a police officer for 12 years before &sect; 8-22-24(d) was amended and fully participated in the pension plan during that time period, he detrimentally relied upon the statute's prior provisions, and thus the amended version could not be used to reduce his benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee agency sued appellant father in the Circuit Court of Wood County (West Virginia) for birth and medical expenses it paid on behalf of appellee mother, regarding the birth of the parties' child. The trial court ordered the father to be solely responsible for the full amount of these expenses, and the father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was born out of wedlock, and the mother could not pay the birth expenses. The supreme court of appeals held W.Va. Code &sect; 48-12-102 (2001) was intended to establish, if possible, parents' joint payment for prospective health insurance coverage for their children, and had no application to the father's liability for the child's birth expenses. Rather than gender, the physical condition of pregnancy distinguished the father's liability for birth-related expenses from that of the mother, requiring a rational basis review of the father's equal protection claim. Imposing this liability on the father, rather than the mother, was rationally related to the determination that imposing this liability on the mother would discourage her from obtaining medical care necessary for the health and survival of herself and the child, which was a consideration inapplicable to the father. Imposing this liability on the father was subject to a determination of his ability to pay those costs on the date the mother was granted birth and medical benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed to the extent it held the father had no right to a hearing to determine his ability to make the ordered reimbursement. Otherwise, the trial court's judgment was affirmed. The matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, in a daytime robbery, at gunpoint, robbed two minor females. He was indicted for two counts of aggravated robbery. The State offered him a plea agreement in which he would be allowed to plead guilty to one count, and the State would recommend a 15-year sentence. Defendant accepted. The trial court accepted his plea but sentenced him to 30 years. During a hearing on his motion for reconsideration, the trial court declined to reconsider the sentence and appointed appellate counsel. Defendant, while expressing some degree of remorse for the robbery and accompanying emotional trauma to the victims, had not divulged information concerning his accomplice or the gun. The use of the deadly weapon infused a considerable risk of injury, and the manner the robbery was conducted in, including forcing one victim to the ground at gunpoint and returning to steal her automobile keys, was particularly terrifying. Having examined the nature of the offenses and the sentences imposed, the reviewing court concluded defendant's sentence was constitutionally proportionate to the character and degree of the offense.</SPAN></P>

After appellee state welfare agency investigated, it petitioned for abuse and neglect. The father exercised his right to remain silent at a preliminary hearing. Thereafter, the trial court held an adjudicatory hearing. The father continued to remain silent. After hearing evidence, the trial court found the father had sexually abused the daughter, denied him visitation, granted him an improvement period, and suggested he receive a psychological evaluation. The father denied he committed any sexual abuse and essentially declined to participate in any psychological examinations for fear anything he said would be used in his upcoming criminal case for sexual abuse. Accordingly, the trial court terminated his parental rights as to his daughter and a minor son. After judgment was entered, the state supreme court found the trial court should have liberally interpreted the statutes regarding the use of examination reports in any subsequent criminal trial, as such statutes were remedial, and crafted an appropriate limiting order to protect him from the use of such potentially incriminating remarks against him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cable provider sued defendant competitor to invalidate the latter's exclusivity contract with an apartment complex, which residents the provider served. The Circuit Court of Wood County, West Virginia, denied relief, but certified this question: whether W. Va. Code &sect; 24D-2-10 (1999) (Repl. Vol. 2001) permitted an exclusivity agreement that violated the West Virginia Tenants' Right to Cable Services Act, W. Va. Code &sect; 24D-2-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provider had been furnishing cable services to tenants of an apartment complex. The complex entered into an agreement with the competitor, giving it exclusive rights to provide cable services to all of the tenants. The trial court denied the provider a preliminary injunction, finding that W. Va. Code &sect; 24D-2-10 (1999) (Repl. Vol. 2001) authorized an exclusivity agreement that violated the Tenants' Right to Cable Services Act. It granted the provider's motion to certify a question as to the interpretation of &sect; 24D-2-10. The instant court reformulated the certified question as follows: where a cable operator was providing services to a multiple dwelling premises without a written agreement with the landlord, did the exception to the Tenants' Right to Cable Services Act, found at W. Va. Code &sect; 24D-2-10, permit the landlord and a second cable operator to enter into and enforce an exclusivity agreement without having to comply with the provisions of the Act? The instant court ruled that it did not. Such a result was illogical and repugnant to the stated purpose of the Act, which was intended to protect apartment dwellers from becoming a captive market for cable companies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the patient settled with the physician, he specifically reserved his right to pursue a claim against the hospital. The common law rule that the release of an agent also released the principal was abrogated by W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7-12, providing that a release of one joint tort-feasor did not bar an action against another joint tort-feasor. The principle of stare decisis required the appellate court to adhere to the rule that vicariously liable parties should be regarded as joint tort-feasors. Any right the hospital had to indemnity from the physician for any judgment entered against it was not affected by the settlement. The hospital could still implead the physician under W. Va. R. Civ. P. 14(a) on a theory of implied indemnity. The settlement with the physician had no bearing on the continued liability of the vicariously liable hospital, as the settlement was not in full satisfaction of both claims. The agreement between the patient and the physician releasing the physician with the clearly expressed expectation that the patient would be able to proceed against the hospital was given effect.</SPAN></P>

The wife and estate argued that the trial court erred when it found that comments during closing argument regarding the non-economic cap in medical malpractice cases, and a jury charge, characterized a confusing, each warranted a new trial. The supreme court of appeals agreed. If any error occurred in using the word &quot;may&quot; in place of &quot;must&quot; in the charge, that error was harmless and the jury was adequately instructed to understand that the million dollar figure represented an absolute upper limit, and not a &quot;target.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant child support enforcement agency obtained an order directing appellee family law masters to hold contempt hearings in child support cases. The masters moved for reconsideration. The Unified Family Court Amendment, W. Va. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 16, created a unified family court system with original jurisdiction in the areas of family law and related matters, as well as such further jurisdiction as established by law.  W. Va. Code &sect; 51-2A-1 et seq. (2000), established a family court division within the circuit courts. However, this legislation did not establish the system of family courts and family court judges embraced by the amendment. Subsequent legislation gave effect to this purpose, effective January 1, 2002. As a result, family law masters serving prior to that date remained persons assigned to assist circuit courts in carrying out their judicial functions in the area of domestic relations matters, and they had no judicial power to enter a final and binding order, such as an order of incarceration for indirect contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens petitioned the Circuit Court of Monongalia County (West Virginia) for mandamus relief to require appellee city council to place initiated ordinance on ballot. The trial court denied the petition, and the citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's charter allowed the proposal of ordinances to the city council which, if not adopted, would be submitted to a popular vote. The citizens proposed a collective bargaining ordinance for city employees which the city council rejected and also refused to place on the ballot. The trial court could only bar placement of the ordinance on the ballot if the required procedures for submitting it to the voters were violated, which they were not, or if the proposed ordinance dealt with a matter not properly the subject of the initiative process, as in cases where a state statute controlled the issue. The city's charter provided voter initiatives could not extend to the salaries of city employees and the city manager was to implement the city's personnel program. While employees' salaries could not thus be the subject of a referendum, the charter provision requiring the city manager to recommend a personnel program to the city council did not preclude the proposed ordinance. Other parts of the proposed ordinance could be voted on, and the ordinance could only be kept off the ballot if all of it was prohibited from voter consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed and remanded with directions to issue a writ of mandamus compelling the city to submit the proposed ordinance to the voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, injured party and husband, obtained an order from the trial court to allow discovery of documents which the hospital asserted were privileged under W. Va. Code &sect; 30-3C-3 (1998) of the West Virginia Health Care Peer Review Organization Protection Act, W. Va. Code &sect; 30-3C-1 et seq. The trial court found documents generated as part of the process of issuing or renewing credentials to the doctor were not entitled to the privilege. The hospital's committee which considered whether staff privileges should be issued or renewed was a &quot;review organization,&quot; as defined in W. Va. Code &sect; 30-3C-1 (1998), and could avail itself of the peer review privilege in &sect; 30-3C-3, because it satisfied the criteria for the assertion of that privilege. While, generally, documents available from original sources extraneous to the credentialing process were discoverable, the doctor's applications for the issuance or renewal of staff privileges, even though generated by the doctor and thus originating from a source external to the credentialing committee, which were created solely for consideration by that committee, were protected by the health care peer review privilege in &sect; 30-3C-3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer filed a petition appealing a ruling of appellee tax commissioner regarding a tax assessment. The commissioner moved to dismiss for failure to file an appeal bond. The Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, granted the motion and dismissed the taxpayer's appeal. The taxpayer sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer appealed administratively from a tax assessment; the commissioner denied the appeal seven years later. The taxpayer appealed to the trial court. Under W.Va. Code &sect; 11-10-10(d), the taxpayer was required, within 90 days of appealing, to post a cash or surety bond, or to seek a waiver of such bond from the commissioner based on sufficient proof of assets. While the administrative appeal had been pending, the taxpayer's records were lost in a flood, which prevented him from obtaining a surety bond. The trial court dismissed the appeal because no bond was filed. The instant court held that &sect; 11-10-10(d), to the extent it vested the sole discretion to waive an appeal bond in the commissioner, was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 11-10-10(d) violated the right of open access to the courts guaranteed by W.Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 17. As the taxpayer's inability to obtain a bond was at least indirectly related to the commissioner's delay in ruling, the taxpayer's failure to seek a waiver of bond from the commissioner did not bar its appeal. If the commissioner denied a bond modification or waiver, the taxpayer was to promptly seek such relief from the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The secretaries had greater seniority than the multiclassified employees. An ALJ had determined that one of the secretaries and one of the multiclassified employees should have been retained, but the trial court found that result to be due to a clerical error. The school board argued that multiclassified school service personnel as defined in W. Va. Code &sect; 18A-4-8(i)(60) (2000) comprised a separate classification category and that a reduction in force in any one category should not affect such employees. The appellate court disagreed and held that under &sect; 18A-4-8g(i), multiclassified employees were employees of each classification category contained within their respective multiclassification titles, and were subject to a reduction in force in any individual category on the basis of seniority accumulated in that category. Any category subject to the reduction in force was to be deleted from the multiclassified employee's job title.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After their son divorced his wife, the grandparents had visitation with their grandson until his mother's new husband adopted him. The child's parents sought to block an evidentiary hearing on the grandparents' petition for visitation on grounds that the grandparents lacked standing to seek visitation under the grandparent visitation act, W.Va. Code &sect;&sect; 48-2B-1 to -12 (1998) (1999), and that the Act was unconstitutional. The appellate court rejected both arguments.  W.Va. Code &sect; 48-2B-4(b) (1999) provided the grandparents with standing to petition for grandparent visitation. The Act was constitutional, and did not violate the parents' rights under the Due Process Clause. This was so because under the Act, grandparent visitation could not be ordered without affirmative findings that such visitation would not cause a substantial interference in the parent-child relationship, and that such visitation served the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rule 26.01 established a Mass Litigation Panel (MLP) to assist in administration of asbestos-related cases.

The trial judge approved a litigation plan that provided for a series of small group, all-issues trials rather than an en masse, common-issues trial. The supreme court of appeals chose to consider the petition as having been brought in mandamus. The court rejected without discussion the claim that Rule 26.01 was unenforceable, and ordered that the litigation plan be supplemented to provide, among other things, that (1) an additional judge would be assigned to administration of the litigation; (2) cases could be tried under the all-issues format established by the litigation plan; (3) additional trial groups should be established, and trials should be scheduled with a view toward commencing all trials no later than July 1, 2002, and (4) subsequent asbestos cases would be transferred to the MLP for inclusion in the appropriate trial group.</SPAN></P>

It was not necessary to award attorney's fees and costs in cases where a jury's verdict exceeded the statutory cap.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia) of robbery with the use of a firearm. Numerous evaluations of defendant's competence to stand trial were conducted. Defendant was sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment after the trial court offered a sentence of 30 years upon a guilty plea. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An evaluation of defendant's mental status indicated he was delusional and unable to assist counsel. After treatment, he was found capable of assisting counsel. Subsequent deterioration resulted in re-hospitalization. He again improved after treatment and was arraigned. An evaluator found defendant incompetent to stand trial. At a competency hearing, the only witness testified defendant was competent, but trial should be held promptly before his condition deteriorated. Trial did not commence for four months. In the interim, an attempted evaluation of defendant's criminal responsibility raised a question of his continued psychotic symptoms. At trial defendant's behavior was irrational and self-defeating. His counsel's mistrial motion was denied. The trial court's failure to further investigate defendant's competence abused discretion, but mistrial was not required. A post-trial determination of defendant's trial competence could be attempted. The trial court impermissibly participated in plea negotiations, indicating the sentence defendant would receive if he pled guilty. He received a harsher sentence upon his conviction after trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was vacated and the matter remanded to determine, if possible, if defendant was competent at trial. The matter was to be assigned to a different judge. If he was incompetent, or a determination could not be made, defendant would receive a new trial. If he was competent, he would be resentenced to no more than the sentence offered by the former judge if he pled guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought writ of mandamus filed on behalf of several West Virginia public interest groups and a former legislator, alleging the legislature was in violation of the Modern Budget Amendment, W.Va. Const. art. VI &sect; 51, and misappropriating the governor's civil contingent fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition for writ of mandamus was filed on behalf of several prominent public interest groups and a former legislator, against presiding officers of the House of Delegates, the state Senate and the governor's office. Petitioners argued the legislature's practices in preparing the budget digest, under W. Va. Code &sect; 4-1-18 (1999), were in violation of the Modern Budget Amendment. They sought to have these declared unconstitutional, directing the legislature to cease and desist from designating funds, and to restore all deletions of lawfully appropriated funds. Petitioners asserted that an item in the digest, which was not also set out in the budget bill, constituted an appropriation. The court did not agree. The use of the budget digest did not have the force and effect of law. In light of the exercise of legislative power to make and approve law under a recent house bill prohibiting transfers, petitioners' issue as to the practice of transferring funds from a legislative expense account to an executive department account by means other than a budget bill or supplementary appropriation, was moot. The court granted a moulded writ, denying petitioners' attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Moulded writ of mandamus granted, requiring legislature to only include as part of the budget digest, information the subject of discussion, debate, and decision prior to final legislative enactment of the budget bill. This holding applied a prospective basis only, thus petitioners' request for attorneys fees was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Lewis County (West Virginia) upheld appellee city's ordinance and found no basis for declaring the appellee's business and occupation (B&amp;O) tax unconstitutional. The lower court rejected appellant's argument that the B&amp;O tax violated state and federal Equal Protection Clauses. The lower court denied appellant's motions for relief. Appellant challenged the lower court's determinations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank filed a declaratory judgment action with the circuit court, seeking to have the business and occupational (B&amp;O) tax declared unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. In support of its equal protection argument, appellant asserted that: (1) the rate setting among the various business classes was performed in an arbitrary and capricious manner and lacked a rational basis; and (2) the B&amp;O tax discriminated against appellant because a local bank such as appellant would have to pay a disproportionate share of the total tax compared to the branch banks. The B&amp;O tax did not violate state and federal equal protection provisions. The provisions of the West Virginia Constitution were not implicated as there was no contention that a uniform rate of taxation was not applied to all the banking institutions affected by the B&amp;O tax. The principles of equal protection were not invoked solely because a law, properly enacted, had a disproportionate impact. Without proof of a discriminatory purpose underlying the law's enactment, a disproportionate impact on one classification did not on its own create a violation of West Virginia's equal protection provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. The lower court did not commit error. There was no state or federal equal protection violation inherent in the business and occupation tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Putnam County (West Virginia) granting summary judgment to appellee, the administratrix of the estate of the decedent. Appellant had alleged in his lawsuit that he was the biological son of the decedent husband, and was consequently entitled to a proportionate share of the assets of the estate of the decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was born in early June 1970. A paternity warrant later that month alleged the decedent was appellant's biological father. The action was settled shortly thereafter without an admission of paternity. However, the decedent paid child support to appellant's mother each month, pursuant to a court order, until appellant turned 18. The decedent died intestate on in 1994. In 1998, appellant filed an action alleging he was the biological son of the decedent and entitled to a share of the decedent's estate. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee, reasoning that W. Va. Code &sect; 48A-6-1(e)(7) required a paternity action to be brought prior to the child's 21st birthday. Judgment was reversed. Appellant could maintain his action without regard to the limitations on such actions set forth in W. Va. Code &sect; 48A-6-1 et seq. The legislature never intended to establish a barrier to an illegitimate's right to prove paternity beyond the purported father's lifetime so as to inherit by, from, and through the decedent. The cause was remanded with directions that the trial court address any relevant issues presented by the parties under a case-by-case standard of review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed; trial court erred in applying limitation of actions provisions of relevant paternity statute to prohibit cause of action asserted by appellant, as these limitation provisions were inapplicable to a civil action by a child born out of wedlock seeking to inherit from his father. Case was remanded with directions that trial court review all relevant issue presented by parties under a case-by-case standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On certification from the Circuit Court of Marshall County (West Virginia), the court considered whether W. Va. Magistrate Ct. R. 1(b) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested for obstructing an officer late on a Friday evening. He was taken to the area jail, where he arrived at 1:26 a.m. on Saturday. Because a magistrate was not immediately available, appellant's initial appearance did not take place until approximately 7 a.m. the following morning. He was acquitted of the charges. Appellant subsequently brought an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to a prompt initial appearance before a magistrate following a warrantless arrest. The trial court certified the question. The question involved W. Va. Magistrate Ct. R. 1(b), which required that one magistrate in each county be on call at all times during nighttime and weekend hours, and that the magistrate had to contact the jail and juvenile detention facilities at regular intervals. The court held that the rule was constitutional, finding that the on-call system struck a necessary and reasonable balance between the demands placed upon the magistrate courts, and the number of magistrates actually available.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the time standards provided by the magistrate court rule were reasonable and the rule was constitutional.

The court issued a rule to show cause against the commissioner of the DOC. Writs of mandamus were granted as moulded because continued incarceration in jails was unlawful and the DOC was ordered to develop a plan to provide some temporary arrangement to meet its obligation to house and detain all those lawfully sentenced to a state penal facility until such time as the new prison was completed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed an appeal from a final order of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), finding that a curfew ordinance promulgated and enforced by appellees was constitutional and valid under state laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellee city adopted a curfew ordinance, appellants sought to enjoin its enforcement, challenging its constitutionality and that it violated their right to parental privacy. When the ordinance was determined to be constitutional and valid under state laws, appellants, asserting trial court error, appealed. Affirmed. Municipalities had authority to create curfew ordinances. Municipal courts, under W. Va. Code &sect; 49-5-2(d) (1998), had authority to prosecute curfew violations by juveniles. Applying the rational basis test, the court stated that juveniles did not have a fundamental right to be on the streets at night without adult supervision. The state's authority over children's activities was broader than that over like adult actions. Additionally, sufficient evidence justified infringing upon the movement of juveniles during specific periods of time, thus, although the ordinance infringed upon juveniles' freedom of movement, it was rationally related to appellees' legitimate interest in their welfare. Although the ordinance impacted on appellants' parental rights, the impact was too minimal to constitute an unconstitutional infringement upon such rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Curfew ordinance infringing on freedom of movement of juveniles was rationally related to appellees' legitimate interest in their welfare, thus, the ordinance was constitutional and valid under state law. Additionally, any impact the curfew had on parental rights was too minimal to be a unconstitutional infringement on those rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner applied for a writ of habeas corpus, requesting the court to secure his release from incarceration from respondent. Petitioner challenged the calculation of his discharge date, and contended that he should have been granted good time credit for his detention pending a parole board review of his parole status. The court held that normally a prisoner was not entitled to good time credits while on parole. However, the court held that a prisoner was entitled to good time credits when a parolee is detained pending a final parole revocation hearing, and the parole board failed to conduct the hearing within the time limits contained in W. Va. Code St. R. tit. 7A, &sect;&sect; 92-1-11.1(b) and 92-1-11.2(b) (1983). Such good time credit was limited to the period of detention necessitated by the parole board's delay. The court held the parole board failed to hold a final revocation hearing in petitioner's case within either the 35 or 30 day period provided by state law. The court held that, if his conduct so warranted, petitioner was entitled to receive good time credit for the additional time he was detained as a result of the parole board's delay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition for writ of habeas corpus, because the state parole board failed to conduct petitioner's parole revocation hearing within the statutory time frame for such a proceeding, and petitioner was therefore entitled to good time credit for the period of detention while awaiting the hearing.</SPAN></P>

The Workers' Compensation Appeal Board denied their claims because their ventilatory function testing showed that they had no pulmonary functional impairment. Appellants challenged the denial of their claims, contending that W. Va.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court interpreted the rule as requiring the exclusive use of the Kory predicted normal values in interpreting the results of ventilatory function tests in occupational pneumoconiosis claims. The court held that the obvious clerical error in the numbering of the rule did not change their interpretation given the legislature's intent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After entering into a conditional plea of guilty for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, defendant appealed the order of the Circuit Court of Boone County (West Virginia) which denied his motion to suppress evidence of marijuana discovered by conservation officers in their search of defendant's car, conducted pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 20-4-7(5) (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. On appeal, defendant contended the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of marijuana discovered by conservation officers in their search of defendant's car. Specifically, defendant argued the search, conducted pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 20-4-7(5) (1994), violated defendant's constitutional protections against warrantless searches and seizures. The court reversed the order denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence. After carefully examining the record, the court determined the evidence was clearly insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle. However, the court rejected defendant's argument that W. Va. Code &sect; 20-4-7(5) (1994) was unconstitutional. The court determined that because a conservation officer could conduct a stop of a vehicle to perform a game-kill survey within the bounds of the State and Federal Constitutions, the court could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted for the first degree murder of her husband. Her direct appeal, state petition for post-conviction writ of habeas corpus, and federal petition for habeas corpus relief were all refused. Petitioner then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state court, alleging a failure to advise her of her right to testify and improper jury instructions. The court denied the writ. The circuit court improperly reconstructed the record to demonstrate that the Neuman instruction was rendered. However, the court determined that even assuming the circuit court failed to provide a Neuman instruction, petitioner failed to demonstrate that the failure was a constitutional violation. Regarding the jury instructions, the instructions were adequate to inform a reasonable juror that the State had the burden to prove the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury was also properly instructed concerning the defense of insanity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents supreme court justice and Secretary of State of West Virginia, to have respondent judge declared ineligible as a candidate for election due to his status as an incumbent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent incumbent judge was appointed and was currently filling the remainder of an unexpired term, which ran until December 31, 2004. On January 29, 2000, he filed a certificate of candidacy for election to a separate 12-year term on the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. When he refused to withdraw his candidacy, relator pro se attorney petitioned the same Supreme Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus, seeking to have respondent declared ineligible. Following an exhaustive examination of constitutional principles combined with an equally thorough review of judicial decisions, the Supreme Court granted the writ, concluding that while the West Virginia Constitution did not expressly proscribe such action, the intent underlying the enactment of W. Va. Const. art. VIII and the state's compelling interest in maintaining the integrity of the judiciary, all compelled a holding that respondent could not seek to enhance his term-length through election process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Writ of mandamus was granted because the limitations or regulations on political activities, which included the restriction affecting eligibility for election to the state supreme court, arose from the State's compelling and permissible interest in its judiciary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Juvenile defendant sought to prohibit the Circuit Court of Preston County (West Virginia), in its juvenile court capacity, from enforcing its order disqualifying defendant's court-appointed counsel from further representation due to apparent impropriety arising from her having formerly represented another juvenile who was expected to be a state's witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Juvenile defendant sought to prohibit enforcement of an order disqualifying defendant's court-appointed counsel. Defendant's counsel had formerly represented another juvenile in the same matter, and he was expected to appear as a state's witness against defendant. Defendant contended that the parties had waived any potential conflict of interest. However, the waiver did not deprive the trial court of its discretion, particularly when a juvenile attempted to waive his rights. No appropriate grounds for issuing a writ of prohibition had been presented. Defendant failed to file, as required, an addendum or appendix of exhibits or affidavits, a memorandum of law, and a memorandum listing those persons upon whom the rule to show cause would be served. Considering the likelihood that counsel would cross-examine the juvenile about matters related to the case -- matters they had discussed while she represented him -- disqualifying her was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Writ of prohibition from enforcement of order disqualifying counsel was denied. The decision whether to disqualify counsel, even when conflict had been waived, was within the trial court's discretion. No appropriate grounds for issuing a writ of prohibition had been presented.</SPAN></P>
