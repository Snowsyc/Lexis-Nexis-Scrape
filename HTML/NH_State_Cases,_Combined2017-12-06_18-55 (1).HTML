</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff real estate developers appealed from an order of the Superior Court, Merrimack (New Hampshire), that granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, the New Hampshire Department of Transportation, Division of Aeronautics (the State) and certain individual officials in an action challenging the State's attempted exercise of its N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 422:46 (2002) right of first refusal to purchase airport property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State twice interrupted the developers' planned purchase of property that included an airport. The court held, first, that the developers lacked standing to challenge the facial constitutionality of &sect; 422:46, since they never owned the property, and that the inability of the seller to offer clean title giving rise to a contract right kept the statute from vulnerability as applied. Since there was no constitutional violation, a claim based on 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 failed. The court applied a three-part test to see whether sovereign immunity shielded the State from claims of tortious interference, focusing particularly on whether the officials had acted under a reasonably held belief that their actions were lawful. It agreed with the trial court that there was no question that the first act of alleged interference, halting the sale while the State evaluated its options, was proper. There was some question, however, as to whether the officials could have believed they were acting lawfully when they sought to enjoin the sale and finance the State's own purchase with development of property adjoining the airport, necessitating remand for further factual development.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment except as to the developers' claim against the State alleging tortious interference with contractual relations. It reversed the summary judgment as to that one claim and remanded for a determination as to whether the State was entitled to sovereign immunity with regard to it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a post-decree proceeding, respondent wife moved to bring forward and modify existing child support. She also sought contribution for college expenses for the 22-year-old child of the parties. The Rockingham Superior Court (New Hampshire) submitted a question to the appellate court for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question was whether the amendment to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 458:17 precluded the trial court from considering contribution of college educational expenses for an adult child when the motion was filed before the enactment of the amendment, but the hearing was scheduled after the effective date of the amendment. When the original order was entered, the trial court had authority under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 458:17, 458:20 to order divorced parents to contribute toward their children's college costs. The appellate court found that the wife's motion did not secure her a vested right under the prior law, but merely pursued an opportunity to seek a discretionary award for college contributions. Because the wife's opportunity to have the trial court consider ordering the husband to contribute to the son's college expenses derived solely from statute and no final judgment had been rendered, the statutory amendment deprived the trial court of jurisdiction over the subject matter. The motion was not a cause of action, in the context of a N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23 analysis. Application of the amendment did not offend the constitutional proscription against retrospective laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question submitted was answered in the affirmative and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of a superior court (New Hampshire), which, following a jury trial, convicted defendant of two counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 632-A:2, I(i), (j) (2003), one count of criminal solicitation in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 629:2 (2004), and one count of endangering the welfare of a child in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 639:3 (2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for various crimes. He appealed, arguing that the superior court erroneously denied his motion to suppress a tape recorded conversation between him and the victim. He claimed that the state's wiretapping statute violated the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution by authorizing electronic surveillance for offenses that were not specifically enumerated in Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2516(2) (Title III). He also argued that admission of the wiretaps violated N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 570-A:8(V) because the State gathered evidence for offenses that were not designated in the authorization and failed to seek judicial approval to use the recording at trial. The court found that Title III specifically excluded one-party consent intercepts. Also, the Supremacy Clause was not violated because the state's statutory scheme was more protective of defendant's rights than Title III. Moreover, post-interception approval under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 570-A:8 was not required because the information obtained was limited to the aggravated felonious sexual assault offense that was enumerated in the authorization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for aggravated felonious sexual assault, criminal solicitation, and endangering the welfare of a child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner filed a lawsuit against defendant State in the trial court (New Hampshire) to contest the legality of a five percent surcharge assessed on all goods sold at the prison canteen pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 622:7-b (2001). The surcharge was found illegal, and the prisoner sought interest on the judgment for a remand. The trial court denied relief, and the prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On an earlier appeal, the court held that because the five percent surcharge did not fund the maintenance, overhead, or operation of the commissary, the surcharge was a tax. On remand, the trial court ordered the State to reimburse those individuals held at the prison who were required to pay the five percent surcharge. The prisoner then sought mandatory costs and interest on the judgment pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 524:1-b; his request was denied. On appeal, the court found that the language of &sect; 524:1-b was mandatory and that the State was required to pay interest. The court rejected the State's argument that the prisoner's request was untimely; until judgment was entered, the interest could not be added. The court found that all prisoners who received pecuniary damages were entitled to judgment interest, not just the prisoner who appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of judgment interest to the prisoner and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff railroad appealed and defendant energy company cross-appealed an order of the Superior Court, Rockingham (New Hampshire). The railroad challenged the entry of summary judgment in the company's favor on the issue of whether N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 373:1 (1995) required it to provide a crossing for underground pipelines, while the company challenged, inter alia, the limitations period applied to a claim regarding its removal of track.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company's predecessor in title had conveyed a right-of-way to the railroad more than a century earlier, in return for an easement for a railroad crossing. When the railroad sued the company for damages resulting from violations of pipeline licenses granted decades later, and to force it to replace or pay for track that the company had removed, the company argued that the claim was time-barred. The high court agreed that the company's construction of underground pipelines was not a reasonable extension of an easement granted in a rural, agricultural context. Nonetheless, the railroad had a statutory duty under &sect; 373.1 to provide an otherwise trapped landowner access through a crossing that could include &quot;other facilities,&quot; a term that encompassed pipelines. The railroad had failed to preserve the constitutional takings arguments that it attempted to raise on appeal. The trial court had properly found, however, that the railroad's claim for its track was essentially one to enforce an interest in land, because track became part of the land, which meant that the much longer 20-year statute of limitations set forth at N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 508:2 (1997) applied to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order and judgment.</SPAN></P>

It applied to any call made to anyone, anywhere, at any time, whether or not conversation ensued, if the call was placed merely with the intent to annoy or alarm another, which meant that the act constituting the offense was complete when the call is made, regardless of the character of conduct that ensued.

The challenged amendment to the articles of agreement, the &quot;unified article,&quot; reapportioned operating and capital expenses among the member towns. In essence, the new apportionment formula was based on the number of students that resided in each town. A prior formula was based on an annual apportionment of average daily pupil membership. The towns asserted that the new formula left them in no better financial position than if they had not joined the district. The court affirmed, holding that (1) the unified article did not violate the legislative objectives of N.H. Rev. Stat. ch. 195; (2) the formula apportioned both capital and operating expenses; (3) there was no statutory mandate that the member towns share all cooperative district expenses; (4) direct and shared costs could be determined under the unified article, as could the apportionment of shared costs; (5) the unified article did not preclude the Department of Education from conclusively fixing each town's proportional share of expenses to be apportioned for local education tax purposes; and (6) the unified article's annual review process was not improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Grafton Superior Court (New Hampshire) made an interlocutory transfer of consolidated proceedings by plaintiff arrestees against defendant State seeking to vacate bail commissioner's fees charged to each of them pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 597.20 (Supp. 2003). The question on transfer was whether the fees violated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 597:20 (Supp. 2003) required arrestees who desired to have bail set for them immediately to pay a $ 30 bail commissioner's fee, which was actually paid to the local government, not the commissioner, if they wanted a hearing when courts were not otherwise in session. The arrestees argued that this denied them their constitutional right of equal access to justice. Since the actual practice was never to withhold a hearing based on failure to pay the fee, so that an arrestee could pay the fee later, the high court found that rational basis scrutiny was all that was required and that the fee was reasonable in light of the burden of special scheduling. Nonetheless, in order to avoid the appearance of the purchase of justice, the high court directed the State to mandate the practice, already followed informally, of explaining to arrestees when they would have a bail hearing if they elected not to incur a fee immediately and also explaining that the fee could be paid later and could be waived in cases of indigency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the statute was constitutional and remanded the matter with instructions to dismiss the arrestees' petitions.</SPAN></P>

It argued that it had been denied due process, that evidence was insufficient, that the statute violated the Commerce Clause, that it had been entrapped, and that the suspension period was neither statutorily authorized nor constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving complaints about the dealer's fireworks sales practices, the department arranged for a series of visits by undercover officers, in the course of which two officers with inadequate out-of-state identification bought items that could not be sold to New Hampshire residents and one officer bought items that should not have been sold at all. The high court found no constitutional violations in that the dealer received plenty of notice and a fair hearing, and the two-year suspension was well within the range permitted both by statutes and by the state constitution. The detailed evidence gathered by the officers amply supported the findings and suspension, nothing about the limits placed on in-state purchasers impeded the free flow of interstate commerce, and the officers could not be said to have entrapped the dealer, whose employees were eager to sell whatever was requested.</SPAN></P>

On remand from the New Hampshire Supreme Court, the trial court held the city could amend the licenses, but granted the company's tax abatement petitions. The company appealed, and the city cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company said it could not be taxed given its public use of the public ways. The supreme court held N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72:23(I)(b) did not exempt the company's use of public property for a public service from the mandate that its license to use the property provide for paying real estate taxes. The legislature intended that the city's interest in the public ways allowed it to tax the company. The company's rights under its license were properly taxed. While no fair market value could be shown for the city's interest in the public ways, the company's use of them could be taxed. Under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 231:163 (1993), the city could amend the company's license for the public good, which required amendment of the license to implement N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72:23(I)(b). The trial court's denial of the company's equal protection argument had to be vacated and remanded to apply the proper equal protection analysis under the rational basis test. The company was only entitled to a tax abatement if it showed its property was assessed at a higher percentage of fair market value than that at which other property was assessed, and it did not do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's denial of the company's equal protection argument was vacated and remanded, and its grant of the company's tax abatement petitions was reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of a trial court (New Hampshire), which convicted defendant of four counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, in violation of N.H.

The court disagreed and held that DNA samples and blood test samples were non-testimonial in nature. Compelling an accused to provide a DNA sample or blood test evidence did not violate N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15. The court further found no error on the part of the trial court in its denial of defendant's motion for a mistrial following alleged improper comments made by the prosecutor during closing arguments. The prosecutor, in discussing defendant's expert, did not improperly comment on facts not in evidence but drew reasonable inferences from the facts proven and had great latitude in discussing the evidence presented to the jury. No error was found with regard to the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on the definition of &quot;household member&quot; as utilized in N.H. Rev. Stat.

The court stayed the filing periods in those house bills.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the 2002 elections, the state congress did not properly redistrict the legislature based on 2000 federal census figures, so the court redrew the districts. Two house bills were later submitted to reconsider the districts for the 2004 elections. The congressmen filed a petition, arguing the bills would create an unconstitutional legislative apportionment scheme. They argued constitutional provisions permitted the legislature to redistrict every 10 years after the federal census, but only at the session of legislature immediately following that census. Having failed to redistrict at the 2002 session, and since the court had already constitutionally re-apportioned the districts, a redistricting at the 2004 session was unconstitutional. The court found that its earlier redistricting did not preclude a redistricting by the legislature, especially since the intent of N.H. Const. pt. II, arts. 9, 11, 26 was that the legislature make a redistricting once every 10 years. The house bills would fulfill that constitutional obligation. The legislature could not reapportion again until its regular session following the next decennial federal census, so the bills were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dissolved the injunctions issued against the filing periods under the bills and the court held that the legislature properly passed the house bills requiring redistricting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Hampshire Judicial Conduct Committee brought a petition for original jurisdiction in the New Hampshire Supreme Court seeking guidance as to the constitutionality of N.H.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Committee argued that ch. 494-A was unconstitutional. The state's highest court held that ch. 494-A violated the separation of powers doctrine by encroaching on the power of the New Hampshire Supreme Court to regulate the conduct of the judiciary. The state's highest court's powers encompassed the discretion to determine when, whether, and to what extent discipline should be imposed on a judge. As N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 494-A:1 (Supp. 2003) interfered with that discretion, it was unconstitutional. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 494-A (Supp. 2003) was not validly enacted pursuant to the legislature's legislative powers of impeachment and address under N.H. Const. pt. II, arts. 17 and 73. The authority to take disciplinary action short of removal was not an overlapping power that was shared by the legislature and ch. 494-A was unconstitutional to the extent that it authorized the New Hampshire Judicial Conduct Commission to impose disciplinary action on judges. The state's highest court declined on justiciability grounds to interfere with the Commission's authority to investigate and report to the legislature on conduct by a judge that might warrant impeachment or removal by address.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute was unconstitutional to the extent that it gave the New Hampshire Judicial Conduct Commission the authority to prescribe a code of judicial conduct, determine whether it was violated, and impose disciplinary actions by reprimand or censure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the Governor and the Executive Council of the State of New Hampshire, petitioned the supreme court, pursuant to N.H. Sup. Ct. R. 11, to rule that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 490:1 (2003) was unconstitutional. Respondent, the New Hampshire Attorney General, appeared in opposition. The justices of the supreme court recused themselves from participating in the case under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 490:3 (1997), and a panel was assembled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 490:1 purported to &quot;unbundle&quot; the administrative functions traditionally attributed to the Chief Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court from his or her underlying judicial functions, and limited the chief justice's term to five years. Petitioners argued that &sect; 490:1 was unconstitutional because (1) the legislature lacked constitutional authority to prescribe the method of selection of judicial officers, and &sect; 490:1 impermissibly limited the chief justice's term of office; and (2) the chief justice position was a separate and distinct office from that of associate justice. The supreme court panel agreed that the chief justice position was a discrete judicial office. Based on N.H. Const. pt. II, arts. 40 and 73-a, the chief justice inescapably held separate and unique judicial powers. Accordingly, the constitution required that the chief justice position be filled by executive nomination and appointment, as the separate commissioning of the chief justice historically reflected. Therefore, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 490:1 violated the separation of powers doctrine under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37, as the legislature was usurping powers of the executive branch.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 6-a, Part II, for purposes of planning and constructing a commuter rail project. The association and defendants, the State and the Commissioner of New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT), filed a joint request for interlocutory transfer to the court without ruling. which the Superior Court, Merrimack (New Hampshire) granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The NHDOT was involved in a project to extend the Massachusetts commuter rail line. Funds collected pursuant to N.H. Const. art. 6-a, Part II (Article 6-a funds) had already been expended by the State to pay for part of the rail project and the State intended to use additional Article 6-a funds for the project. The association filed an equitable action arguing that such use of Article 6-a funds was unconstitutional. Defendants argued that expenditure of Article 6-a funds on the rail project fell within the permissible transportation purposes outlined in the Constitution because railroads constituted public highways. The court disagreed, finding that art. 6-a was adopted to insure that fees paid by citizens for the privilege of using the State's roadways would be expended only upon the highway system. The court concluded that the use of highway funds on the rail project fell outside this mandate. The court then remanded for a determination of reasonable attorney's fees for the association, noting that fees were warranted because, in successfully challenging the State's diversion of Article 6-a funds, the association had conferred a substantial benefit on State highway users.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that use of Article 6-a funds for the rail project violated the State constitution.

The appellate court held that the second test was covered by the exigent circumstances exception to the search warrant requirement. Police observed defendant exhibit signs of intoxication. The trial court properly found exigent circumstances based on the nature of blood alcohol evidence and the delay inherent in obtaining a search warrant at night.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion in the Hillsborough District Court (New Hampshire) to dismiss a complaint filed against him alleging that he violated a temporary protective order by having his attorney contact the victim. The trial court certified a question to the New Hampshire Supreme Court pursuant to N.H. Sup. Ct. R. 9 as to whether contact of the victim by a defendant's attorney constituted a violation of a temporary protective order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that defendant violated the protective order by contacting the victim through his attorney. The state's highest court agreed. Holding a defendant criminally responsible for knowingly contacting the victim through his attorney effectuated the intent of the legislature in enacting N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 173-B. There was no legislative intent to except legitimate contact by certain third parties from N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 173-B, and precluding contact by legitimate parties did not render ch. 173-B unconstitutionally overbroad. The state's highest court refused to create a legitimate purpose exception to the contact prohibited by a protective order. The interpretation also did not deprive a defendant of his effective assistance of counsel or due process rights as the New Hampshire and United States Constitutions did not confer upon a defendant unfettered access to witnesses, especially domestic violence victims with protective orders. Finally, neither a defendant, the victim, nor either party's representative had the authority to approve exceptions. If a defendant had a legitimate reason to contact the victim, he could seek an exception from the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment on jury verdict of the Superior Court, Strafford (New Hampshire), that convicted her of child endangerment in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 639:3(I) (1996). She argued that the trial court erred in not enforcing a cooperation agreement, that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, and that the jury charge was confusing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant testified at her boyfriend's murder trial, after defendant's toddler daughter died as a result of injuries inflicted by him. She testified under a cooperation agreement that promised her immunity from prosecution, but was later charged with misdemeanor child endangerment. The high court held that the State was not bound by the cooperation agreement, because the record showed that defendant, after initial candid statements regarding defendant's conduct, later sought to minimize it. It went on to hold that &sect; 639:3(I) was not unconstitutionally vague, even though it contained both the terms &quot;purposeful&quot; and &quot;knowing.&quot; They were easily reconciled, as there were many situations in which a parent might purposefully ignore a minor duty to a child without knowingly endangering the child. Moreover, the jury charge, taken as a whole, accurately described how the law applied.</SPAN></P>

The boiler required the construction of a four by five-and-a-half foot housing shed attached to the home. The town's zoning of the homeowner's land forbade any new construction that added to a house's footprint where that house was, like the homeowners' house, within 50 feet of a lake and protected as a preexisting, nonconforming use. When a neighbor complained about the shed, the homeowner sought a variance for it, which was denied. That denial was affirmed on appeal. The homeowner appealed, claiming the ZBA decision was arbitrary and without sufficient evidence and violated her right to equal protection of the law because it was being selectively enforced against her. The court found that the homeowner failed to show the ruling was unreasonable because the ZBA made its decision in conformity with the stated general purposes of the town's zoning rules. Moreover, the homeowner failed to show instances of either selective enforcement or conscious intentional discrimination against her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney, without obtaining trial court permission as required by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-C:25(II) (2002) (amended 2002), advised her client to disclose confidential information to a newspaper because she believed N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-C:25 to be unconstitutional as a prior restraint on free speech violating N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 22 and U.S. Const. amend. I. The attorney argued that her client did not violate N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-C:25, and therefore that the record lacked support for finding that the attorney violated N.H. R. Prof. Conduct 1.2(d). Rule 1.2(d) explicitly required that any proposed course of conduct was to include a good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning, or application of the law. The attorney could have taken, but did not take, either of two good options to satisfy the good faith effort requirement: (1) ask the trial court for permission to disclose the information and raise her constitutional arguments in support of her request, or (2) petition for declaratory relief under N.H.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While employed at a tanning salon, defendant made numerous offensive remarks to female customers and employees. The trial court found defendant guilty because the women were upset, uncomfortable, humiliated, embarrassed, and outraged by the comments. The state supreme court held that the women experienced internal feelings that were unlikely to result in an outward response that would cause a public disturbance. Moreover, defendant's direct invitations for sexual activity were made outside of the presence of others and, therefore, were unlikely to create a breach of the peace. Despite their offensive nature, defendant's comments were not likely to create a substantial and unjustifiable risk of a violent reaction on the part of an ordinary person. Therefore, the trial court misinterpreted &sect; 644:2(II)(b) and the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was Mirandized and thereafter inculpated himself, which he then recounted on a videotape. He pleaded not guilty and after jury selection, defendant sought to represent himself, which was initially granted. The trial court reversed its ruling, based on the fact that defendant intended to proceed with trial pro se in absentia and the trial court found that such was incompatible with self-representation. After interlocutory appeal on the issue, the matter was remanded and the trial court held two hearings as to the appropriate manner to handle the error. The trial court denied defendant's request for a mistrial with prejudice, denied his request to dismiss the matter, and held that the error was only a slight erosion of his Faretta rights. It continued the trial and defendant was convicted. On appeal, the denial of his self-representation right was found to be a structural defect, warranting a new trial. The court also determined that admission of only part of the recorded tape was error, that there was no violation of defendant's right to a fair cross-section of the community for his jury, and that denial of recusal was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town took a taxpayer's property by tax deed in August 1996, for non-payment of property taxes. At the time the town took the property, the taxpayer owned $ 10,650 in unpaid taxes, interest, water, and sewer charges. In January 1997, the town sold the property for $ 50,000 to a third party, and it retained all proceeds from the sale, except for $ 12,432 which was paid to a creditor of the taxpayer. In October 2000, the taxpayer filed a lawsuit against the town, claiming that it wrongfully retained money which should have been paid to him. The state supreme court held that (1) its holding in its Thomas Tool Services decision that the pre-1998 version of the alternative tax lien statute was unconstitutional applied only to the parties in that case and to similar cases pending on August 28, 2000, the date of the court's decision; and (2) because the taxpayer filed his action against the town after the court decided Thomas Tool, the taxpayer's suit to recover money which the town allegedly wrongfully retained under the statute that was found unconstitutional was barred, even though it was filed within the period authorized by the applicable statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court held that the classifications under &sect; 86:6(II)(a), (b), (c), (h), which exempted inheritances received by spouses of stepchildren of a decedent's most recent marriage but imposed a tax on the decedent's brothers, sisters, nephews, and nieces, did not involve a suspect class. Nor did it affect a fundamental right. Moreover, the right to inherit was not among those identified under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12 and N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 6. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 86:6 was rationally related to the state's interest in fostering the family unit. As a result, &sect; 86:6 did not violate state or federal equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with reckless conduct and unauthorized use of a propelled vehicle, and his counsel filed a motion raising the issue of his competency to stand trial. A mental health professional examined defendant and concluded that he was not competent to stand trial, but could be restored to competence within one year with treatment. The State declared its intent to seek compelled treatment to restore defendant's competence, pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 135:17-a (Supp. 2002), and defendant filed a motion seeking an order declaring the statute unconstitutional. The trial court ruled that &sect; 135:17-a was constitutional and ordered defendant to continue mental health treatments, including taking anti-psychotic and anti-anxiety medications. The state supreme court held that (1) &sect; 135:17-a was constitutional; and (2) although the trial court acted within its discretion by ordering defendant to continue mental health treatments, the court had an obligation to closely monitor defendant's treatment to ensure that the medications prescribed were appropriate to his condition and did not deprive him of a fair trial or the effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Hillsborough, Southern Judicial District (New Hampshire) made an interlocutory transfer of the case without ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties began dating and had one biological child. The parties never married each other. The parties ended their romantic relationship. The mother subsequently adopted a son. The parties' romantic relationship later resumed, and the significant other moved in with the mother. The mother then adopted two more children from Ukraine. The significant other refused the mother's repeated requests that he adopt her adopted children. The mother eventually asked the significant other to move out of her residence. He did so. Although he was at first allowed to visit with her adopted son, the mother soon terminated the visitation after her son began to exhibit what the mother described as increasing fear and anxiety over his visits. The court held that it would violate the fit natural or adoptive parent's state constitutional rights to grant custodial rights to an unrelated third person over the express objection of that parent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An unidentified cell phone caller reported to the state police that a car was being driven in a recklessly. Based on this call, an officer spotted the driver's car. The officer observed the vehicle, but did not see any violations of law. Nevertheless, the officer stopped the driver and asked her to perform field sobriety tests. The driver refused, and the officer arrested her for driving under the influence. Because the driver refused to take a chemical test, and had a prior refusal on her motor vehicle record, the motor vehicle division automatically suspended her license. The trial court found that the hearings examiner who upheld the suspension erred in drawing a negative inference from the driver's failure to testify at the administrative hearing, and erred in failing to consider the validity of the underlying traffic stop. The appellate court ruled that the lawfulness of the stop was not necessary to sustain a valid license suspension. Nor was a criminally valid arrest required in order for the State to proceed. The exclusionary rule did not apply to administrative license suspension hearings. There was no need to overrule case law adopting these holdings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 265:79-a (Supp. 2002) vehicular assault cases, (1) the State appealed the Derry District Court (New Hampshire) dismissal of the State's complaint, ruling &sect; 265:79-a improperly shifted the burden of proof to defendant, and (2) the Salem District Court (New Hampshire), without ruling on defendant's motion to dismiss, transferred three questions to the New Hampshire Supreme Court under N.H. Sup. Ct. R. 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court answered questions regarding &sect; 265:79-a. Section 265:79-a was the legislative response to fill a gap that was evidenced by a discrepancy in punishment for reckless driving and for traffic violations that put local prosecuting authorities in a quandary about how to charge persons who caused accidents resulting in death or serious injury, when those persons committed a traffic violation, and did not intend the ultimate result. The supreme court determined that 265:79-a required a criminal negligence culpability standard, the lowest criminal culpability standard under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 626:2(I)--that for a misdemeanor. The &quot;without intent&quot; language of 265:79-a did not mean that defendant could be charged without any criminal culpability, but meant that defendant could be charged even though he did not intend to actually cause, for example, a death. Therefore, the State still had to prove defendant's driving was criminally negligent. The final sentence of &sect; 265:79-a was stricken since it removed the evidence weighing function from the jury and shifted the burdens of proof and production to the defendant. Section 265:79-a was otherwise constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the first case's dismissal decision and remanded both cases to the respective trial courts for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Hillsborough-northern Judicial District (New Hampshire) of aggravated felonious sexual assault for sodomy, criminal restraint, and two counts of felony criminal threatening. The trial court ordered defendant to serve four consecutive sentences, totaling 33 1/2 to 67 years, in the New Hampshire State Prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant picked up a prostitute and physically and sexually assaulted her until he let her leave him. The victim reported the incident. Police officers took defendant to a police station for questioning. The officers said that after the questioning began they informed defendant of his Miranda rights and that he waived those rights. Defendant contended that his statements from the questioning were not admissible, as the officers did not read him his Miranda rights until after they finished questioning him. Defendant also sought to depose the victim as to her past sexual conduct. On appeal, the court found that the evidence before the trial court was sufficient to support its factual finding that defendant was given his Miranda warnings before substantive interrogation began. Defendant failed to show that the trial court's finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Further, defendant failed to establish that his proposed line of inquiry into the victim's past sexual conduct during the deposition process could have led to any relevant information which would have aided the jury in ascertaining any specific fact contested.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation appealed an order by the Rockingham Superior Court (New Hampshire) enjoining the corporation from pursuing offers to purchase the stock of a target corporation until the corporation complied with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 421-A (1998), the Security Takeover Disclosure Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act did not violate the Commerce Clause. While former N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 421-A was unconstitutional due to the extent of the indirect burden it imposed on interstate commerce, the reformed version of the Act applied in an even-handed manner to both intrastate and interstate offerors. The Act was likely survive a Commerce Clause analysis even as applied to a foreign target company, though the instant target company, under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 421-A:2, VII (1998), was a New Hampshire business. There was no risk of inconsistent regulation. The takeover corporation failed to sustain its burden of proving that the Act imposed a burden on interstate commerce that was clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. The Act's disclosure provision ensured that New Hampshire shareholders received the information needed to make an informed decision about tendering their shares. The nexus between the New Hampshire-based target corporation and New Hampshire was sufficient under the Commerce Clause to justify the Act's regulation of the takeover corporation's takeover bid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chief justice of New Hampshire and two associate justices survived legislative efforts to impeach them, although one of them actually had to go through a trial in the state senate. They sought reimbursement of their legal expenses under the statute that permitted employees of the executive branch to recover such expenses, but the high court (with retired judges sitting in place of the justices in question) held that in the absence of any evidence of unconstitutional treatment that endangered the integrity of the judicial branch, the political question doctrine implicated in the separation of powers provision of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37 precluded the granting of relief. N.H. Const. pt. II, arts. 17 and 38 made it clear that impeachment of judges was a matter for the legislature, and this responsibility included the duty to make rules regarding the process.

Defendant moved for a new trial asserting ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant moved to reconsider and vacate, arguing that the stalking statute, N.H. Rev. Stat. An. &sect; 633:3-a(I)(d) (1996 &amp; Supp. 1999) (amended 2000), was unconstitutionally vague. The court denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the stalking statute,&nbsp;N.H. Rev. Stat.

Const. pt. 1, art. 15 and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The supreme court found that in reading the statute in a common sense manner, together with the protective order, that it was clear what these portions of the stalking statute prohibited; thus, the statute gave defendant adequate warning that his actions were prohibited. Thus these portions of the statute were not void for vagueness as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 262:22, :19, and :24, where a defendant's license was revoked until restored, even after the initial revocation period expired, the defendant could properly be charged with a violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 262:23. As the court rejected defendant's expired-status argument as a matter of law, it did not entitle him to a lesser-included offense instruction. The only evidence upon which the jury could rationally find that defendant knew his license had been revoked also supported the finding that defendant knew of his status as a habitual offender. The State sought to admit a prior conviction as tending to prove defendant's knowledge of his status as a habitual offender. While the prior conviction had some relevance to the issue of knowledge, the probative value of a prior conviction for the same offense was substantially outweighed by its prejudice. Admitting the prior conviction was error.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 632-A:2 (1996), and eight counts of felonious sexual assault, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 632-A:3 (1996), following a jury trial. Defendant appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges were based on defendant's sexual abuse of a minor female. Defendant's first trial ended in a mistrial, and defendant was convicted following a second trial. Defendant argued that his second trial violated his double jeopardy rights. The state supreme court held that a trial court could declare a mistrial where a jury was genuinely deadlocked without prohibiting a retrial. Defendant argued that that the jury in the first trial was not genuinely deadlocked but had effectively found him not guilty. The appellate court held that defendant's argument failed, as the jury foreman's post-mistrial letter was not admissible evidence to impeach the mistrial. The affidavit or testimony of a single juror was inadmissible, where it was offered as a basis for setting aside a mistrial, where the mistrial directly resulted from the jurors' inability to reach a verdict. Defendant further argued that police officers' failure to read him his Miranda rights rendered statements made by defendant inadmissible. The appellate court held that defendant was not in custody when the statements were made, and, therefore, the police were not required to read defendant his Miranda rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Concord District Court (New Hampshire), after a bench trial, convicted defendant of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 641:4(I) (1996) giving a false report to law enforcement and imposed the maximum sentence, a $ 1,200 fine. Defendant appealed. The case implicated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 22 freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper published defendant's report to them that police caused her friend's injuries when he was arrested in her home. The police contacted defendant and asked her questions; some she answered and some she did not. The mere act of giving false information to the police was insufficient to constitute a &sect; 641:4(I) offense. The State also had to prove that defendant's purpose was to convince police that another person had committed an offense. N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 22 provided at least as much protection as the First Amendment, so the supreme court decided the case under New Hampshire law, applying a special scrutiny test, using First Amendment cases only as an analytical aid. Free speech protected certain false statements. The evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant's purpose was to induce a criminal investigation. The presence of several circumstances compelled the decision, especially that the initial report was to a public forum, a newspaper, rather than the police or the government, whom she did not seek out. She demonstrated that her primary purpose was to embarrass or discredit the police, and not to instigate a criminal investigation of the police.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, Grafton (New Hampshire), denied the company's motion for partial summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of the city. The company appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company obtained a permit from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to construct an AM radio station with four antenna towers, each at a height of 266 feet. The company proposed to locate the station in an area of the city zoned light industrial. The city's zoning ordinance, however, allowed radio towers only in rural zoning districts and only to a maximum height for new towers of 42 feet. The company requested a variance, which the city's zoning board of adjustment denied. The company argued that the city ordinance was preempted by the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 151-613 (2000). The state supreme court conclude that for anyone seeking to operate a new FCC-licensed AM station in the city, compliance with both the zoning ordinance and federal law was a physical impossibility. The state supreme court held that where it was impossible to comply with federal law and the zoning ordinance at any location in the city, an actual conflict existed and the local law was preempted by federal law. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the city as to the claim concerning the tower.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded as to the claim concerning the tower, and was affirmed as to the taking claim.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 215-A:34, II (2000) and 508:14, I (1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent and another employee were at a party at their employer's home and were riding around on the sand and gravel pits of the employer's property in an off-highway recreational vehicle (OHRV). The other employee drove off a 15-foot wall that had no warning signs or barriers, and decedent was killed. The wrongful death action alleged negligence and recklessness and claimed damages under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556:12, I and III (Supp. 2002). The trial court granted the employer's motion to dismiss, holding that the claims were barred by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 215-A:34, II and 508:14, I. The court held that &sect; 215-A:34, II applied to the risk created by the wall in the sand and gravel pits, as such was a variation in terrain, which was an inherent danger in the sport. It was noted that claims were barred, even where plaintiffs alleged reckless conduct by the employer as landowner. There was no violation of the equal protection clause of N.H. Const. pt. 1, arts. 12 and 14, because the significant benefit of land availability under N.H. Rev. Stat. &sect; 215-A:34, II outweighed the burden imposed by the right to sue restriction.</SPAN></P>

The town sought a declaration that the district's method of apportioning capital costs was illegal, and a reimbursement. The trial court held the district's method was improper but it could not determine if the town was due a refund. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 195:8, the district could not review its allocation formulas until it was in operation for five years. It complied with this requirement and voted to retain the formulas it was using.

The warrant article did not have to be presented in any particular fashion, under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 195:8, nor did it have to contain any particular language.

During the conversation, the officer smelled a strong odor of alcohol on defendant's breath, and later arrested him after discovering that he lacked a valid license. The state supreme court held that the facts did not justify defendant's seizure under the community caretaking exception to N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 19. Absent any indication that defendant needed aid, the officer was not justified in seizing him under the community caretaking exception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DCYF filed a petition alleging that a stepfather had abused his stepdaughter. A district court found that the stepfather had abused his stepdaughter by hitting her and having her commit oral sex on him, and the court ordered the stepfather not to have contact with his stepdaughter. The stepfather exercised his right, pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-C:28, to de novo review in superior court, and he filed a motion for appointment of counsel and submitted a financial affidavit which showed he was indigent. However, the superior court held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-C:10 did not authorize appointment of counsel for stepparents and it denied the motion. It then found that the stepfather had sexually abused his stepdaughter. On appeal, the state supreme court held that the Due Process Clause of the New Hampshire Constitution required appointment of counsel for a stepparent accused of abuse or neglect under New Hampshire's Child Protection Act, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 169-C, and as N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-C:10(II)(a) not only failed to provide for, but prohibited the appointment of counsel for an accused stepparent, it violated due process.</SPAN></P>

The court appointed a technical advisor to assist it in reviewing redistricting plans that were submitted to the court, reviewed all plans that were submitted by a deadline that the court established, and held that no plan submitted to the court was appropriate for wholesale adoption. As a result, the court established its own plan that retained the same number of representatives (400) that were approved in a 1992 redistricting plan, abolished floterial districts, and created 88 new single- and multi-member districts, all of which were comprised of contiguous territories. In creating its plan, the court established standards for acceptable and unacceptable deviations from the ideal district population, defined as the state's population divided by the total number of representatives, and explained the criteria it used to develop its plan.</SPAN></P>

The property owner argued that the trial court did not use the proper standard of review in determining the constitutionality of the ordinance, and other errors. The property owner argued that the superior court erred in evaluating his substantive due process challenge to the ordinance by applying the rational basis test, instead of the middle tier, or fair and substantial relationship standard. The state supreme court held the rational basis test was the proper test in this case. The state supreme court further held that the ordinance requirements pertaining to inspections of the premises and for a cash bond were not unreasonable. As to a claim that the ordinance violated the owner's substantive due process rights, the state supreme court held that the owner did not preserve this issue below, and did not address the issue.</SPAN></P>

The DCYF argued that the trial court erred because it disregarded important parental responsibilities and failed to consider numerous factors relevant to determining the father's ability to fulfill these obligations. The appellate court held that given the length of the father's incarceration, the child's age at separation and upon his father's release, and the inability of family members or friends to take custody and care of the child, the father was unable to discharge his parental responsibilities. The father had been unable to provide for the child's physical needs, including food, clothing, medical care, or a domicile since the child was 13 months old. Although the father made efforts to maintain contact with his child, the fact still remained that the child had been and would be without his father's care during most of his formative years as a result of the father's criminal behavior.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate asserted, inter alia, that the surcharge violated New Hampshire's prohibition against disproportionate taxation. The supreme court held the surcharge was a tax because it neither funded the maintenance, overhead, or operation of the commissaries nor reimbursed the prison for providing a commissary, and its stated purpose was to raise revenue to finance the victims' compensation fund. The only transactions subject to the tax were those at the prison commissary, and there was nothing unique about the goods sold at the commissary. The only distinction between these transactions and other retail transactions was the fact that the sale took place at the state prison. No legitimate reason was presented to create this distinction, which was, therefore, impermissible. The surcharge was not a special cost assessment because state prisoners neither made use of nor benefitted from the victims' assistance fund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff landowner's application for a building permit was denied, he filed a petition against defendant town, seeking a declaratory judgment that Rye, N.H., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 601 was unconstitutional. The case was consolidated with the landowner's appeal of a later denial of a variance application. The Superior Court (New Hampshire) ruled against the landowner. The landowner appealed. The town cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's lot complied with zoning regulations when the plat was approved. Later, but before the landowner bought the lot, the town increased the required lot size and frontage, so that the lot was rendered nonconforming. The town argued that the landowner's failure to appeal earlier denials of applications for a variance and a building permit barred the petition for declaratory judgment since it arose from the same facts. The appellate court held that a party was allowed to collaterally attack zoning actions and ordinances by declaratory judgment after the expiration of the appeal period in N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 677:4. The developer of a subdivision that had undergone substantial construction under an approved plan acquired a vested right to complete the project in accordance with the original subdivision despite a later contrary ordinance. This right ran to the developer's successors in interest. The trial court erred in not considering whether the developer incurred substantial costs or liabilities and also when it ruled that there was no material change between the landowner's 1995 and 1998 applications.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 172-B:1(X), the officer could take such person into protective custody. The appellate court noted the trial court construed N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 172-B:3 as allowing the police to assume protective custody over persons impaired by drugs. However, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 172-B:1(X) defined &quot;intoxicated&quot; as a condition in which the mental or physical functioning of an individual was substantially impaired as a result of the presence of alcohol in his system. Therefore, the appellate court determined the statute did not authorize the police to take individuals into protective custody if, in the police officer's judgment, the individual was under the influence of drugs. Accordingly, the appellate court concluded the trial court erroneously construed the statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant explained the situation to the officer. When the officer inquired about the circumstances of the incident, defendant was reluctant to answer. Defendant then became increasingly belligerent. When asked to leave the police station, he refused. The officer arrested defendant. A citizen was near the station lobby and witnessed the incident. There was sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty of disorderly conduct, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 644:2(III)(a), and criminal trespass, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 635:2(II)(b). With regard to the disorderly conduct claim, the citizen's testimony that she was stunned and shocked by defendant's loud and disrespectful behavior towards the police was bolstered by similar testimony by three police officers. There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of criminal trespass, because defendant received strong warnings to leave the station or risk being arrested. Defendant was not entitled to discovery information related to possible racial profiling on the police force, because defendant failed to put forth any evidence of discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, school districts, school children, and taxpayers, had sought a declaration that the system by which defendant State financed education violated the New Hampshire Constitution. The matter had on two prior occasions been before the New Hampshire Supreme Court. The latest action sought a declaration as to whether standards of accountability were required and whether there were sufficient statutes, regulations, and/or rules in place.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a motion to invoke jurisdiction and declare the State's system for funding public education unconstitutional. They sought an order from the supreme court declaring that the State had not met its constitutional obligation to define an adequate education that included a system for implementation and that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 198:40 (1999), the provision for funding an adequate education, was unconstitutional on its face. The State objected, stating that it had fully complied with the state constitution's demands regarding educational funding. The State argued that the existing laws provided sufficient standards of accountability. The supreme court agreed that there were many different ways that the legislature could fashion an educational system while still meeting the mandates of the state constitution. However, it held there was more work to be done for the State to fulfill its duty to provide a constitutionally adequate education and incorporate meaningful accountability in the education system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that accountability was an essential component of the State's duty and that the existing statutory scheme had deficiencies that were inconsistent with the State's duty to provide a constitutionally adequate education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendants arose after they prevented a wildlife officer from leaving one of their fields. On appeal, defendants argued that there was insufficient evidence that they acted with the requisite mental state to commit the crime of obstructing government administration. There was sufficient evidence to find that defendants' conscious object was to prevent the officer from driving his truck out of the field. In carrying out that conscious object, defendants, in fact, interfered with an officer who was performing an official function. The appellate court could not say that no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer was not performing an official function while on defendants' land that evening. The officer was entitled to perform his duties without hostile challenges from members of the public. The officer, on the other hand, was expected to act with civility even in the face of incivility. The absence of that civility, however, did not change the fact that the evidence in the case was sufficient to convict each defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court had previously implied that under N. H. Const. Art. V, &sect; 1, 2, the taxing district was the town and not the cooperative school district and, here, adopted that rule explicitly. Under the premise that the town was the relevant taxing district for a constitutional analysis of taxes used to support a cooperative school district, differences in local education tax rates among towns in a cooperative school district did not violate N.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 72-B (Supp. 1999) imposed a tax on real property used in commercial excavation. It was designed to encourage landowners to reclaim property after excavation ended. Certain landowners challenged the constitutionality of the scheme under various clauses of the New Hampshire Constitution. The high court held, first, that the tax did not impose an improper classification of property in violation of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12, because it rationally related to the encouragement of reclamation. It violated N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 5, however, because it based assessments solely on a parcel's size and location, with no consideration of its value. Although the New Hampshire Constitution permitted tax assessments to be based on valuations of property according to its current use as well as its highest and best use, there was no constitutional basis for taxation unrelated to value.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 675:5 (1996) did not require towns to determine the validity of a protest petition prior to the vote on a warrant article and that defendant town had not impermissibly combined multiple amendments to its zoning ordinance into a single ballot question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the property owner argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in ruling that: (1) the town was not required to determine the validity of the protest petition prior to the voting; and (2) the town had not impermissibly combined six separate amendments into a single ballot question.  N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 675:5 (1996) did not mandate a determination of the validity of a protest petition prior to voting. The single subject of the ballot question was changing the lot area and density of medium- and high-density districts based upon the public water and sewage services provided to each lot. A review of the town's zoning ordinance supported the conclusion that the proposed changes to articles 5 and 6 of the ordinance were interrelated. Both provisions of the ordinance regulated lot size and density for those lots serviced by municipal water or sewer and, as such, it was appropriate to combine the various changes in one ballot question so as to avoid an anomalous result where one lot size would have been treated disproportionately from others.</SPAN></P>

When the mobile homes were not moved by June 15, 1993, as agreed, the town brought a legal action seeking injunctive relief, civil penalties, and attorney's fees. One mobile home was removed during the summer of 1993 but the other was not removed permanently until July 1997. The state supreme court held that (1) N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 676:17, as it existed prior to its amendment in 1997, was constitutional because it placed the property owners on notice that they could be fined by the town, and gave them the right to challenge those fines in court; and (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding the town attorney's fees, because even though the trial court found that the property owners had not acted in bad faith, the award was based on the promise they made to pay the town's attorney's fees in the event of default.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the state supreme court agreed. The town had discretion to allow for connection waivers. The sole injury or loss to the landowner was the replacement of his septic system with connection to the public line. The cost to connect was insignificant. The harm to the landowner and his property was not enough to render the town's ordinance unconstitutional as applied. The landowner waived his equal protection claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A development company, a landlord, and a grocery company owned three parcels of property in the commercial district of a town. The landlord's property was occupied by a major retail company and there was a large store on the property. The grocery company wanted to build a supermarket on its property and it submitted a proposal to the town to widen two roads on property owned by the development company and the landlord so that potential customers could more easily access the supermarket. The town approved the proposal under the understanding that the grocery company would pay for all improvements and even though the proposal eliminated one entrance to the retail company's parking lot. The state supreme court applied a two-step analysis to determine if the town had act properly under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 231:8 and held that the record supported the town's findings that the public interest outweighed the rights of the affected landowners and the burden which the improvements would impose on the town.

At the close of trial, a jury found defendant not guilty of felony criminal mischief, but guilty of misdemeanor criminal mischief, a lesser-included offense. The state supreme court held that (1) the fact that the prosecution lost photographs that were taken of the car was negligence but not culpable negligence, and the trial court properly refused to dismiss the charge against defendant because defendant did not show that loss of the photographs prejudiced his case; (2) the trial court properly instructed the jury on lesser-included offenses; and (3) because N.H.

The first was that he was denied jury unanimity because jurors did not have to agree on which predicate acts constituted the prohibited course of conduct. The high court held that in pattern crimes the actus reus was the pattern, not the individual acts, so there was no violation. Defendant also argued that he was subjected to double jeopardy for individual acts that took place during the time frame covered by the pattern, but the high court held that the trial court protected defendant's rights by an appropriate jury instruction.

They also argued that the reviewing court announced a standard of proof that was much higher than the one they expected. The reviewing court found that because the taxpayers sought to have the entire statewide property taxation scheme declared unconstitutional, they were required to show more than slight or inadvertent disproportion; they had to show a widespread scheme of disproportionate taxation. The taxpayers failed to meet their burden. The taxpayers' claim that the reviewing court's standard was much higher than the one expected failed, as the taxpayers were unable to prove the lesser standard of isolated or inadvertent lack of uniformity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An injured worker, who worked for a private company, sought to strike down, as unconstitutional, the provision of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 281-A:33 (1999), which limited recovery of double compensation benefits to state employees, in certain situations involving employer misconduct. The appellate court found the law did not implicate &quot;a right to a remedy,&quot; but rather imposed a detriment to state employers. As such, it did not violate N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 14. The worker also presented an equal protection argument, claiming the law improperly treated private employees differently from state employees. The appellate court disagreed, finding that although the statute treated private and state employees differently, it was proper to do so. In applying a rational basis test to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 281-A:33 (1999), which implicated a purely economic benefit, the court found the legislature intended to give parity to public employees, which did not have the protection of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 651 et seq. This was a proper purpose which was rationally related to the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband appealed a jury verdict from the Superior Court of Hillsborough, Southern Judicial District (New Hampshire) in favor of the defendants, a doctor and his employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Husband sued the doctor and his employer for medical malpractice, alleging that the doctor's failure to act according to the standard of reasonable professional practice in treating his wife's fractured ankle resulted in the amputation of her leg. The trial court found for the doctor and his employer. On appeal, the husband argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury regarding the elements of medical negligence. Upon review, the appellate court reversed the judgment. Because the mere error of judgment instruction was reasonably capable of confusing or misleading the jury regarding the reasonable standard of professional practice and whether the doctor failed to act in accordance with that standard, the trial court erred by so instructing the jury. The erroneous jury instruction was a substantial error that could have misled the jury when it determined whether the doctor failed to meet the standard of care. Legal fault in the case included both violating the standard of care and causation, and it was unclear whether the erroneous jury instruction affected the outcome. Therefore it could not be said that a reasonable jury could not have found medical causation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first two trustees wanted to cut the trees to develop adjacent land. After the board denied their request, they sold the land to the third trustee whose request was also denied. Trustees variously asserted, inter alia, that (1) the scenic road statute was impermissibly vague by its terms and as applied to them and was an unlawful delegation of legislative power, (2) the board's decisions constituted unconstitutional takings, (3) the board's decisions were unsupported and unreasonable, and (4) the motion for reconsideration should have been granted. The appellate court held, inter alia, that (1) the statute was sufficiently clear to warn an average person of the prohibited conduct and implicitly required the board to exercise discretion consistent with the purposes of the road's scenic designation, and, thus, was not vague; (2) the statute was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power; (3) the decisions were not takings as trustees were not denied access to, or economically viable use of, their property; (4) the board's decisions were supported by the evidence and were reasonable; and (5) denying the motion for reconsideration was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, plaintiffs claimed they bore more than their fair share of the statewide property tax burden. Plaintiffs won. On appeal, the New Hampshire Supreme Court held that plaintiffs failed to present statistical data that provided a full reliable picture of the actual operation of the statewide property tax system; and although they proved it was flawed, they did not prove that the flaws produced a systematic pattern of disproportionate taxation or substantial inequality so great that it had to be deemed intentional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a licensed orthopedic surgeon. Although he was eligible to become board certified by the appropriate specialty board recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties, he was not so certified. Because he was not similarly situated with those health care providers who were ineligible for board certification, there was no equal protection problem involved. Even assuming, arguendo, that plaintiff was similarly situated with those providers who were ineligible for board certification, any apparent classification implicated only plaintiff's economic rights. Legislation merely regulating economic benefits and burdens, with no other significant feature, was reviewable under the rational basis criterion when challenged under the equal protection clause. The statutory classifications were rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Accordingly, &sect; 281-A:38(II) did not deprive plaintiff of equal protection of the laws under use N.H.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was treated by defendant physicians after suffering severe injuries in an automobile accident. She eventually sued them on grounds that their negligence deprived her of a chance of a fuller recovery. Prior medical malpractice case law in New Hampshire had never squarely faced the issue of whether a plaintiff could recover for lost opportunity. The court adopted the majority rule, treating lost opportunity as a separate injury, for which plaintiff could recover if she proved defendants' negligence caused that injury to her, and her resulting damages, that is, the extent to which future damages were increased, by the preponderance of the evidence. This type of injury fit perfectly well within the plain language of the definition of a medical injury at N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 507-E:1(III) (1997), so there was no need to even examine the legislative history, although it, too, supported the adoption of this rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After constructing a bypass around plaintiff town, defendant New Hampshire transportation department reclassified the segments of the old road as local. One portion was to receive state maintenance only during the summer, and the other was to return to local status altogether. The court held, first, that failure to timely challenge the initial reclassification was not a procedural bar under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 541 (1997), because plaintiff did not question the action, only whether taking it without providing additional highway funding was lawful under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 28-A. The court held that the constitutional provision only applied to new, expanded, or modified programs. There was nothing new about holding municipalities responsible for their own roads.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipality did not seek review of the equalized assessment determined by defendant county's department of revenue administration within the short statutory period of review. Later, after it had given a large abatement to a local taxpayer, plaintiff sought to withhold the portion of tax attributable to taxation at the higher value, eventually seeking a judicial declaration that forcing it to pay the whole amount violated the proportionality requirements of N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 5. The court held that perfect proportionality was not constitutionally required. An equalization had to become final at a certain point; otherwise they would become subject to revision for years afterward. A provisional settlement entered by the parties was not evidence of a contrary understanding. It had always been understood as provisional pending a decision on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order, because proportionality of taxes could only be achieved within bounds of practicability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This interlocutory transfer without ruling from the Superior Court, Rockingham (New Hampshire), questioned the constitutionality of the 1999 amendment to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 33:8; 1999 N.H. Laws 134.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute governed voting requirements municipalities and school districts had to meet to issue bonds and notes. The question transferred was whether the 1999 amendment, as applied to the defendant school district, violated either N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 39 or the equal protection provision of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12. The court responded in the negative, holding a change in the supermajority voting requirement for all official ballot municipalities and districts under the amendment had not altered the form of government in any particular city, town, school district, or village district. Accordingly, the amended statute did not violate N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 39. The court held voters in communities or school districts operating under different forms of government were not similarly situated. The statute, as amended, provided differing processes for citizens voting under different forms of government; those voters were not similarly situated. Consequently, no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Remanded; the court rejected the argument that the difference between a two-thirds and three-fifths majority in different communities operating under different forms of government either established separate treatment for citizens based on political participation and political views, or impinged on their fundamental rights of voting and free speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent had historically provided electric generation, transmission, and distribution services to New Hampshire residents as part of a bundled package. In 1988, respondent filed for bankruptcy, and in 1989, it entered into a rate agreement with the State that provided for fixed annual rate increases for seven years and permitted respondent to include certain intangible deferred assets in its rates after the fixed rate period ended. The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) issued a statewide restructuring plan in 1997. Respondent and its affiliates challenged the plan in federal court, asserting it violated numerous federal statutory and constitutional provisions. These lawsuits were settled. Petitioners appealed the PUC's order approving a revised settlement agreement on constitutional and statutory grounds. Order was affirmed. Petitioners failed to sustain their burden of proof to show that the PUC's decision approving the utility rate was unlawful or unreasonable. In fact, the overall effect of the rate was well within the zone of reasonableness. The mere fact of a rate disparity between residential and industrial customers was not enough to constitute unlawful discrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order was affirmed; petitioners neither argued nor demonstrated that the total effect of the new utility rate agreed upon between State and respondent was constitutionally unjust or unreasonable. A stranded cost recovery charge was not discriminatory merely because residential customers would pay stranded cost recovery charges that were higher than industrial customers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town appealed the trial court's ruling that application of land use change taxes was unconstitutional. Plaintiff cross-appealed the trial court's determination that the court lacked jurisdiction to abate taxes assessed against a portion of that land. The appeals court affirmed the decision in part, reversed in part, vacated it part and remanded the case. The court reluctantly departed from the majority view, and adopted the view that the relevant transaction was when the land is removed from current use. The record reflected that the town assessed the land use change tax on Phase I of the land between September 1995 and April 1996. These assessments post dated the enforcement date of the 1991 amendments. The application of these amendments, therefore, was not unconstitutional. Moreover, since plaintiff did not request abatement on the land included Phase II of its development, the court the court had no jurisdiction to abate them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An official with defendant Department of Safety held a meeting with hearing examiners who presided over administrative license suspension (ALS) hearings to discuss new ALS law. The official instructed hearing examiners to conduct hearings in certain ways to facilitate police officers. Several individuals petitioned for declaratory judgment, requesting the trial court order defendant department to make available all unpublished guidelines and declare the guidelines void under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The intervenors proceeded to trial and the superior court found intervenors' due process rights violated because the instructions were rules which had not been promulgated pursuant to the APA. The court remanded. The official's comments were permissible, as they did not directly interfere with particular decisions. The goal of simplifying the ALS process was properly within defendant's policy-making function. However, those instructions pertaining to hearsay, relevance, and others binding on the examiners' discretion were rules subject to APA procedures. Instructions that merely comported with established law, such as comments about continuances, were not rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff utility owned and operated a high pressure natural gas pipeline which transmitted wholesale natural gas for distribution. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulated plaintiff's rate base, which was determined by the original cost less depreciation, or net book cost, of its assets. At defendant's behest, all of plaintiff's property was revalued and assessed. As a result, plaintiff sought a tax abatement for 1995. The trial court held that plaintiff failed to prove that it was being taxed excessively, and denied plaintiff's abatement request. Plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed. The use of the replacement cost method of valuation was not erroneous. Plaintiff had no standing to challenge its assessment on the grounds that the underlying fee holders might be entitled to an abatement. Because plaintiff could sell its property in excess of net book cost, the assessment was reasonable. Thus, defendant properly revalued all of plaintiff's property. Also, the lower court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant remedial relief where that relief was not required.</SPAN></P>

Defendants cross-appealed the court's declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, but indicated it had implemented the injunctive relief, making that part of their appeal moot. The suit concerned the plaintiffs' entitlement to retirement benefits as public employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city was required to enroll employees in the state retirement plan, but enrolled some employees in its own plan. Plaintiffs, enrolled in defendant city's plan, sought a declaratory judgment they were entitled to enroll in the state plan, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees. Defendant city was ordered to enroll all employees in the state plan, but plaintiffs were not allowed to &quot;buy back&quot; years of service under the state plan, pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 100-A:3, VI(d) (Supp. 1999), and their request for attorney's fees was denied. Plaintiffs appealed and defendant city cross-appealed. Defendant city's attempt to revoke its participation in the state plan was ineffective, as it continued to enroll employees in it, and state legislation did not permit a dual retirement plan system. No legislative act could have validly undermined plaintiffs' vested rights to state retirement benefits. However, plaintiffs should have been allowed to &quot;buy back&quot; years of service because they were otherwise deprived of benefits vested if defendant city had enrolled them in the statutorily required plan.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 607(A)(2) (1986) and N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 654(5) (1996), violate N.H. Const. pt. I, Art. 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was incarcerated at the New Hampshire State Prison on felony convictions. When he requested an absentee ballot to vote from a city clerk, the request was denied. The clerk sent him a copy of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 607(A)(2) (1986), which prohibits a felon from voting &quot;from the time of his sentence until his final discharge.&quot; The trial court declared the disenfranchisement statutes unconstitutional and ordered local election officials to allow the plaintiff to vote. Appellant State of New Hampshire challenged this ruling. The central issue was whether the felon disenfranchisement statutes violated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 11. After a review of the article, its constitutional history, and legislation pertinent to the right of felons to vote, the court concluded that the legislature retained the authority under the article to determine voter qualifications and that the felon disenfranchisement statutes were a reasonable exercise of legislative authority, and reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town appealed judgment of the Rockingham Superior Court (New Hampshire), which dismissed plaintiff's petition seeking an injunction against defendants to stop live nude-dancing at defendants' business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court dismissed plaintiff town's petition on the basis that live nude-dancing, although in violation of zoning ordinance for sexually-oriented businesses, was a lawful nonconforming use. On appeal, plaintiff argued, inter alia, that trial court erred in ruling that fantasy-booths were a nonconforming use exempt from 1994 zoning ordinance. The court reversed judgment, finding that although the use existed before plaintiff enacted 1994 ordinance, it did not qualify as a nonconforming use because it was not a lawful preexisting use. Because the change in use did not receive site-plan approval, it was illegal and therefore ineligible to later qualify as a lawful nonconforming use. The court declined to estop plaintiff from enforcing its site-plan ordinance, as defendants were aware that site-plan review was required for a change of use, and the court declined to enforce equitable remedy of laches in favor of defendants, who knowingly violated plaintiff's site-plan review ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The was judgment reversed. Although use existed before plaintiff enacted zoning ordinance in 1994, it did not qualify as nonconforming use because it was not a lawful preexisting use. Because change in use did not receive site-plan approval, it was illegal and ineligible to later qualify as lawful nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>
