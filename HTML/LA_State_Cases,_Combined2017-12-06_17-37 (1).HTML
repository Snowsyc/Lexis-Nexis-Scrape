<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with soliciting an undercover officer to engage in &quot;unnatural oral copulation for compensation.&quot; The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, held that the United States Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas, rendered Louisiana's &quot;crime against nature&quot; statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89(A)(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional, and granted defendant's motion to quash. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89(A)(1) prohibited crimes against nature, same being the unnatural carnal copulation by a human being with another of the same sex or opposite sex or with an animal. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89(A)(2) provided that the solicitation by a human being of another with the intent to engage in any unnatural carnal copulation &quot;for compensation&quot; was a crime against nature. In Lawrence, the United States Supreme Court had recognized a due process right of liberty of consenting adults to engage in private sexual relations without intervention of the government. However, the court held the trial court's reliance on the latter decision, and its conclusion that the statute was enforced in a discriminatory manner, was misplaced. The United States Supreme Court noted that Lawrence did not involve public conduct or prostitution, and thus, left unaffected any offenses charging such behavior. Thus, the United States Supreme Court's decision did not impact Louisiana convictions charged under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89(A)(2), involving solicitation to engage in unnatural carnal copulation &quot;for compensation,&quot; or cases interpreting that section of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's granting of defendant's motion to quash and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff commission filed a writ of mandamus to compel defendant judges to collect costs from certain traffic violators, as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:57(G). On remand, the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, For the Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, ruled that &sect; 32:57(G) was unconstitutional. The commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission sought to compel the judges to impose a $ 5 fine pursuant to &sect; 32.57(G) for persons who were found guilty or pled nolo contendre to any motor vehicle offense that occurred on one of two bridges or the approaches to and from those bridges. The judges refused to collect this cost believing that the statute was unconstitutional. The appellate court, before deciding the issue of whether the statute was unconstitutional, first addressed the issue of standing. The appellate court held that the judges had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute that was otherwise presumed to be constitutional. The appellate court followed other judicial decisions that held that executive officers of the state could not, sua sponte, challenge the constitutionality of a statute and applied that reasoning to judges. The court noted that although it was uniquely the province of judges to interpret the law, it was essential that they constrained themselves to do so only when an appropriate case was presented to them for adjudication. The appellate court reversed the trial court's ruling that &sect; 32:57(G) was unconstitutional and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Commissioner of Insurance filed a petition seeking injunctive relief to prohibit enforcement of 1995 La. Acts 739 and 1999 La. Acts 1332, enjoin an administrative law judge's ruling approving appellant insurer's Rental Condominium Unitowners' policy form (RCU form), and declare the Acts unconstitutional. The 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) found in favor of the Commissioner. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Acts created the Division of Administrative Law (DAL), transferred the authority to conduct adjudications for certain agencies to the DAL, and precluded an agency seeking judicial review of adverse rulings. The court found no violation of the state constitution as argued by the Commissioner. The district court declared 1995 La. Acts 739 unconstitutional, inter alia, because it violated La. Const. art. V, &sect; 1, by vesting judicial power in executive branch employees. The administrative law judge (ALJ) conducted an adjudication to determine whether the RCU form complied with applicable sections of the Insurance Code and ordered the department of insurance to approve the policy form as submitted. The ALJ did not exercise any authority beyond that granted him by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:994(D). 1995 La. Acts 739 authorized the ALJs employed by the DAL to exercise quasi-judicial power, and, the ALJ exercised quasi-judicial, rather than judicial, power when he reviewed the submitted RCU policy form because it occurred in the regulatory context. Such a determination had traditionally been vested in the executive branch and was not a function that lay solely within the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, the Commissioner had not satisfied his burden of proving that the legislature's enactment of the Acts was in violation of any constitutional provision. The judgment of the district court was reversed, vacated, and set aside. The judgment of the district court declaring the decision and order of the ALJ null and void on the ground that it was rendered by an entity without constitutional authority was reversed, vacated, and set aside.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, municipal association and parish, sued defendants, the State and the Firefighters' Retirement System (FRS), and sought a declaration that the employers' contribution rate to the retirement system was statutorily fixed at 9 percent and an injunction preventing defendants from demanding more than 9 percent. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court, For the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, granted the injunction. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before 2002, the employers of members of the FRS paid the rate of 9 percent as their contribution to the FRS. In February 2002, the FRS actuary stated he would recommend that the employer contribution be set at 18.25 percent. Plaintiffs sought the issuance of a preliminary injunction enjoining the State and/or the FRS from taking any action to collect payment from any of the plaintiffs in excess of an amount equal to 9 percent. The trial court granted the injunction and held that the La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 11:103 and 104 were unconstitutional as applied to the FRS. The appellate court reversed the injunction and the finding that &sect;&sect; 11:003 and 11:104 were unconstitutional, as the amendments to La Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:103 did not cause the unfunded accrued liability in the FRS to grow, the existence of an unfunded accrued liability did not render the FRS actuarially unsound, and the rate that employers were required to contribute did not float, but changed based on the actuarial needs of the fund based on several different factors. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:04 was not unconstitutional in that the actuary made its recommendations based on the formulas in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:103.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the injunction that prohibited defendants from seeking more than 9 percent contribution from the employers and reversed the trial court's determination that the statutes that set the employers' contribution rate were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which granted defendant's writ of habeas corpus and found La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 648(B)(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional, and which ordered defendant's immediate release from all state supervision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought the writ on the ground that allowing a trial court to impose probation upon her, an unrestorably incompetent defendant, violated her right to due process, and thus the statute authorizing such probation was unconstitutional. Art. 648(B)(2) required that a court order a defendant held under state supervision even after experts had determined that there was not a substantial probability that he or she would attain the capacity to stand trial in the foreseeable future. In affirming, the court held that art. 648(B)(2) violated La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it required that defendant, who had not been convicted of any crime, to be held in state custody after it had been determined she was incapable of standing trial in the foreseeable future, solely on account of her incapacity to stand trial. The court rejected the State's argument that the trial court's probation order was a civil commitment under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 648(B)(3). By &quot;sentencing&quot; defendant to probation under the provisions of art. 648(B)(2), the trial court necessarily found that she posed no danger to herself or to others, which was required for civil commitment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, agreeing that the statute at issue was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a wrongful death and survival claimant, sought certiorari review of a judgment from the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, Parish of Tensas (Louisiana), which, in a motor vehicle accident case, declined to review the trial court's order granting the request of defendants, driver and insurer, for DNA testing to determine whether the claimant was the decedent's child. The trial court dismissed the claimant when the results were negative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent agreed under former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:75.2 to a stipulated child support order and acknowledged parentage under La. Civ. Code. Ann. art. 203. In an exception of no right of action, the driver and insurer contended that the claimant lacked standing to assert a wrongful death and survival action under La. Civ. Code. Ann. arts. 2315.1, 2315.2. The paternity test results revealed a zero percent probability that the claimant was the decedent's child. The court, in affirming the dismissal of the claimant from the case, held that the one-year limitations period of La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2004 for an action to annul a civil judgment did not apply to the collateral attack on the claimant's paternity, because the child support proceedings were criminal, not civil. Collateral estoppel under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4231 did not apply, because the parties were not the same. The driver and insurer had standing to contest claims of an illegitimate child pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 207. Because the claimant was not the decedent's biological child, the decedent's formal acknowledgment of paternity was null, and the presumption of parentage was rebutted.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The district court ruled in favor of defendants. The Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, Caddo Parish, Louisiana, reversed. The court granted a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs asserted that defendants' policy of restricting to adult men only the use of a certain dining area was facially discriminatory and in violation of La.

The district court determined that the country club was a public facility, but reached the decision that there was no arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable discrimination by defendants. Conducting a de novo review, the court of appeal reversed, deciding that defendants failed to carry their burden of proof that either economic/market factors or male preference was an appropriate objective furthered by the gender-based discriminatory practice. On further appeal, the court stated that the court of appeal's decision to perform a de novo review was questionable. However, the court affirmed the decision, stating that women should not be excluded from dining with men in a public dining facility, as such gender-based discrimination failed to pass constitutional muster. The conclusion that defendants failed to satisfy their burden of proving its men-only policy was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable was just as compelling under the manifest error standard of review as it was under de novo review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was assessed sales and use taxes pursuant to Plaquemines, La., Ord. No. 174 on its consumption of off-road diesel fuel. The fuel was used primarily to operate the internal combustion engines of marine vessels transporting supplies and personnel to the taxpayer's offshore drilling and production facilities. The taxpayer paid under protest and filed suit to recover the amounts paid, contending that the assessment was barred by La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(C), which prohibited a political subdivision of the state from levying a tax on motor fuel. The trial court found that the assessment was within the local government's taxing authority under La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 29. The court, in analyzing La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(C), concluded that both the framers and the voters intended that political subdivisions be prohibited from levying a tax on any material burned to produce motion in a machine or engine. Because the off-road diesel fuel purchased by the taxpayer was used primarily to operate the internal combustion engines of its marine vessels, it fell within the term &quot;motor fuel&quot; as used in La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(C). As such, it was not subject to local sales and use taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an adult, defendant committed an armed robbery for which a jury convicted him. The trial court found that defendant was a second felony offender because of a prior juvenile delinquency adjudication and enhanced his sentence pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1A(1)(a). Defendant appealed his sentence as excessive and unconstitutional. The court of appeal found that the trial court erred in enhancing defendant's sentence on the basis of the prior juvenile adjudication. The court, in affirming the decision of the court of appeal, held that because juveniles did not have a right to a jury trial in delinquency proceedings, juvenile adjudications could not be used to enhance adult felony convictions pursuant to &sect; 15:529.1. A juvenile adjudication was not a conviction for any crime and, therefore, should not be counted as a prior conviction. To equate an adjudication with a conviction as a predicate offense for purposes of habitual offender sentencing would subvert the civil trappings of the juvenile adjudication to such an extent as to make it fundamentally unfair and violative of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the attorney general's office, the Rapides Sheriff's Office, and the Rapides District Attorney's Office, challenged a ruling of the Ninth Judicial District Court, for the Parish of Rapides, Louisiana, which held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:9(B)(1) was unconstitutional, as it violated defendant's equal protection rights under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 and U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:9(B)(1) provided for the expungement and destruction of an arrest record when an individual was arrested for the violation of a misdemeanor offense, but prohibited destruction of the arrest record when an individual was arrested for the violation of a felony offense. In reversing, the court held that &sect; 44:9(B)(1) was constitutional, because the statutory classification was rationally related to a valid state interest. Retaining felony arrest records served a legitimate government interest, because such records were useful in uncovering criminal conduct, aided in setting bond, and facilitated the work of correctional institutions. The statutory classification, which was determined by an individual's arrest status, either misdemeanor or felony, also served a legitimate government interest. Because the challenged classification was predicated on grounds other than birth, race, age, sex, social origin, physical condition, or political or religious ideas, the minimal standard of scrutiny was the appropriate level of equal protection analysis. The trial court erred in assigning the burden of proof, and defendant failed to meet his burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, stating that there was nothing in &sect; 40:1299.47 that provided that a party in a medical malpractice proceeding was prevented from retaining a panel member as an expert at the trial of the matter. The court noted that allowing medical review panelists to testify as experts furthered the goal of promoting settlement of medical malpractice claims, because it provided additional support for the position of the party in whose favor the panel ruled, thereby encouraging the other party to seek settlement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted by an Orleans Parish grand jury for the first degree murder. Defendant filed two motions to quash his indictment challenging the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:114 and a number of articles in the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans, granted defendant's motion to quash his indictment, and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to quash his indictment based on the unconstitutionality of a number of articles of the code of criminal procedure. The district court specifically found that defendant had not suffered any real harm as a result of any of the subject criminal code articles and statutes challenged. Thus, the district court implicitly found that defendant had failed to show that the code articles and statutes he had challenged seriously affected his rights, as required, in order for a person to have standing to bring a constitutional challenge. However, the motions were granted for the purpose of inviting the instant court to &quot;speak&quot; to the constitutionality of the challenged provisions. The instant court reversed the grant of defendant's motions and held that once the district judge found that defendant lacked standing to challenge the subject criminal code articles and statutes, it should have denied defendant's motions to quash. The instant court declined the invitation to consider the constitutionality of the articles and statutes, and vacated the district court judgment declaring the subject criminal code articles and statutes unconstitutional and granting the motions to quash.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a criminal case arising from the investigation of the quality of care rendered to four residents of defendant, a state-licensed health care facility, the trial court ordered the testimony transcribed in response to a motion filed by defendant employees, to enjoin proceedings before the grand jury, and to empanel a new grand jury. The Third Circuit Court of Appeal, Louisiana, denied the State's request for review. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended that the trial court should not have considered defense counsel's motion because the inquiry into the factual allegations of the motion compromised the independence of the grand jury as an investigating body and jeopardized the secrecy that was the hallmark of grand jury proceedings. The supreme court agreed with the State that the trial court erred in denying its motion to dismiss defense counsel's motion to enjoin the grand jury proceedings; therefore, the State should not have been cast with any costs for transcribing grand jury proceedings. As the trial court found the allegations made in the motion by defense counsel would not have justified enjoining the grand jury investigation, the allegations were not so egregious as to pose a threat to constitutionally protected interests. While comments made by the prosecutor in the presence of the grand jurors were improper, they were not so prejudicial in terms of the grand jury's traditional function that they created a grave risk of an indictment returned on the basis of any bias fostered against counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court was faced with the issue of whether the ameliorative changes in Louisiana's habitual offender law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, applied only to those cases in which the defendant committed the charged crime after the effective date of the amending act or whether they could be applied to a defendant who was adjudicated a habitual offender after the effective date of the amending act, but whose crime was committed prior to the effective date of the amending act. It concluded that the applicable habitual offender provisions were those that were in effect at the time of the commission of the charged offense. Accordingly, the supreme court reversed that portion of the appellate court's judgment to the contrary. However, because it determined that defendant's habitual offender sentence was improper, the appellate court pretermitted consideration of defendant's second assignment of error contending that the sentence imposed was unconstitutionally excessive. The case was therefore remanded for consideration of that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower appellate court held that &sect; 33:2218.2(A)(2)(a) was unconstitutional because it violated the exclusive authority of the Commission to regulate the compensation of state classified employees, as provided by La. Const. art. 10, &sect; 10(A)(1), and that the legislature did not have the authority to enact La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2218.2(A)(2)(a) pursuant to the minimum wage exemptions for firemen and municipal policemen found in La. Const. art. 6, &sect; 14(B)(5). The court affirmed, concluding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2218.2(A)(2)(a) was unconstitutional because in enacting said law, the legislature infringed upon the constitutional powers of the Commission that could only be abridged by constitutional amendment. A plain reading of La. Const. art. 10, &sect; 10(A)(1) indicated that the Commission had the exclusive authority to regulate &quot;compensation and disbursements&quot; for state classified employees. Compensation was inclusive of both uniform pay and supplemental pay. Additionally, the harbor police were outside the purview of the constitutional exceptions found in La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, parents, sued the Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) for the wrongful death of their daughter. The district court awarded each parent $ 500,000. The Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), affirmed. The instant court granted certiorari primarily to resolve a split among the circuits over whether the cap for wrongful death damages applied &quot;per death victim&quot; or &quot;per plaintiff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding the language of the statute ambiguous, it was necessary to ascertain the Louisiana Legislature's intent and purpose in enacting La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5106(B)(2). After reviewing the legislative history of the statute, the Louisiana Legislature's intent did not clearly require a &quot;per death victim&quot; construction over a &quot;per plaintiff&quot; construction, especially given the conflicting interpretations of the provision in the circuit courts. As the application of the rules of interpretation failed to illuminate definitively the legislature's intent, the rule of strict construction applied to the interpretation of laws in derogation of common rights. As La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5106(B)(2) provided a statutory cap on damages in derogation of the rights of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315.2 beneficiaries, the instant court had to construe its provisions strictly in favor of the beneficiaries. Thus, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5106(B)(2) allowed for multiple $ 500,000 caps in wrongful death actions in accordance with a &quot;per plaintiff&quot; construction. Also, after viewing all the evidence, there was no manifest error in finding DOTD negligent and allocating 65 percent fault to DOTD.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana), reversed, finding the statute unconstitutional. The State subsequently applied for and was granted writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issuance of a search warrant was not a power necessary to exercise the jurisdiction of a court, nor did it interfere with the independence of the judiciary. In contrast to a procedure necessary to exercise the jurisdiction of a court, the issuance of a search warrant was concerned with investigatory procedure, as evidenced by the primary function of the warrant to protect individual privacy rights from the unfettered investigations of police officers. In issuing the warrant, a non-judicial officer did not detract or interfere with the jurisdiction of a court, but simply provided a check and balance to the investigatory process. The issuance of a search warrant was not a preliminary procedure that required a judicial determination to protect the independence of the judiciary; it was a protective procedure afforded an individual, insuring his privacy would not be invaded absent a determination by a neutral and detached magistrate. Thus, the portion of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:716(B)(1) that authorized the Commissioner of the Fifteenth Judicial District Court to issue search warrants was constitutional, as it did not delegate a solely &quot;judicial power&quot; to the commissioner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police investigators questioned defendant, regarding a report they received from his 10-month-old daughter's pediatrician that the infant had tested positive for gonorrhea. During the initial interview, defendant admitted that, from time to time, he would lie on the living room couch while masturbating and watching pornography, sometimes while his daughter played or slept on the floor nearby. The State subsequently charged him with indecent behavior with juveniles under &sect; 14:81(A). Defendant filed a motion to quash the indictment and the trial court granted his motion, finding merit in his arguments regarding vagueness and ambiguity of &sect; 14:81(A). The appellate court held that the trial court erred in considering attenuated hypothetical applications of &sect; 14:81(A) in ruling the statute unconstitutional; in holding &sect; 14:81(A) was unconstitutionally vague, overbroad, and ambiguous, by its failure to define the terms &quot;lewd and lascivious;&quot; and in ruling that &sect; 14:81(A) was unconstitutionally vague by essentially preempting the trier of fact's role in determining whether the child saw or sensed that a sexual act was taking place. Thus, his motion to quash was improperly granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fund challenged a decision from a district court (Louisiana), which entered judgment in favor of appellee mayor by determining that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 11:1481, 11:82 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fund filed an action against the city seeking to recover amounts owed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:1481. The city challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 11:1481. The mayor filed a petition in intervention both in his official capacity and in his capacity as a taxpayer. He also challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 11:1481. The district court decided that &sect; 11:1481 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:82 were unconstitutional, but that decision was reversed. On remand, the district court determined that it was unnecessary for the mayor to formally amend his petition for intervention. The district court again entered judgment that both statutes were unconstitutional. On review, the decision was vacated and remanded due to several procedural errors. The mayor should have been required to formally amend his petition because heightened pleading requirements applied to claims asserting the constitutionality of statutes. Further, the district court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing on the fund's objection to the mayor's standing as an intervenor. Finally, the district court erred by reissuing the same reasons for its earlier judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was vacated and set aside. The case was remanded with instructions to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine if the mayor had standing to pursue the action. If the district court determined that the mayor had standing, it was ordered to reexamine the constitutional issues as they related to the mayor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff telecommunications services provider sued defendants, a tax collector and others, for a refund of use taxes. The trial court granted the collector summary judgment and ordered the provider to pay assessed taxes and interest, but not penalties or attorney fees. The Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Calcasieu, Louisiana, affirmed, finding 2002 La. Acts 85, &sect; 3 to be unconstitutional. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provider sold cell phones below cost to customers who bought a cell phone &quot;package.&quot; The collector determined that this type of transfer of discounted cell phones was not a &quot;sale at retail,&quot; but that the provider &quot;used&quot; the cell phones in its business and thus should have paid use tax, not sales tax, based on the cell phones' wholesale prices. The provider paid the use tax assessment under protest and filed the instant suit. After both parties appealed the trial court's ruling, 2002 La. Acts 85 was enacted, which amended La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:301 and purported to legislatively repeal the Mercury rule, under which a provider was liable for a use tax when it used cell phones as marketing tools rather than reselling them. The court of appeals held that the Act did not invalidate the trial court's ruling because the Act was unconstitutional; it violated La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 15 by retroactively extinguishing debts owed to a government entity. The supreme court reversed. Because the unconstitutionality of the Act had not been asserted in any &quot;pleading&quot; (as defined by La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 852), the court of appeals erred in reaching the constitutionality issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeals was vacated and set aside, and the case was remanded to the trial court to properly raise the issue of the constitutionality of the Act and to conduct further proceedings. If the taking of evidence was required, the parties could be given the opportunity to introduce evidence in the trial court for a determination of the constitutionality of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant expressway commission filed a petition for writ of mandamus against appellee judges in their capacities as public officers, seeking the issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the judges to comply with the provisions of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In written reasons for judgment, the district court found that the judges had sufficient interest to question the constitutionality of &sect; 32:57(G) and determined that &sect; 32:57(G) was unconstitutional on several grounds. La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D) provided, in part, that a case was appealable to the state supreme court if a law or ordinance has been declared unconstitutional. In the instant case, the district court's judgment simply denied the petition for writ of mandamus filed by the commission; it did not declare La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:57(G)&nbsp;unconstitutional. It was only in written reasons for judgment that the district court opined the statute was unconstitutional. A judgment and reasons for judgment were two separate and distinct documents. Appeals were taken from the judgment, not the written reasons for judgment. Because the district court's judgment did not declare &sect; 32:57(G)&nbsp;unconstitutional, the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that it did not have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of La.

The court of appeal upheld the defendant's conviction based on the disfigurement and impairment of a mental faculty, a pair of components of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34.1. On review, defendant argued that the State failed to prove that the victim suffered serious bodily injury. The supreme court concluded that the presence of blood alone did not satisfy the serious bodily injury element of second degree battery. The supreme court also found that the State failed to offer any evidence of extreme physical pain by way of testimony from the fact witnesses. The evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for second degree battery, but it was sufficient to sustain a conviction for simple battery.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the police had no probable cause to arrest defendant for resisting an officer, and therefore, defendant had the right to resist the unlawful arrest. The state supreme court ruled that the verdict of the trial court was correct. The police had probable cause to arrest defendant for remaining on the premises after being asked to leave, La. Rev.

Ann. &sect; 14:402(E) for the introduction and possession of contraband in a correctional center. After their indictment, two defendants filed motions to quash, in which the third defendant joined. The district court's denial of the motions was affirmed. The matter was before the court on Writ of Certiorari to the Court of Appeal Fifth Circuit, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of the defendants were correctional officers in the facility where the third defendant was incarcerated. All were indicted on several charges arising from the officer defendants' providing of a cell phone to the third defendant. The cell phone was considered to be contraband pursuant to the catchall provision in the last sentence of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:402(E). The court held that the catchall provision violated the separation of powers clause at La. Const. art. II, &sect; 2. Under La. Const. art. III, &sect; 1(A), legislative authority was vested exclusively in the legislature. There was no language in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:402(E) delegating that authority to anyone, yet the sheriff, who was in charge of the correction facility and was a member of the executive branch, was deemed cell phones to be included as the type of contraband covered by the statute. Delegation of legislative authority was also required because the crime was punishable as a felony. Because the catchall provision was severable from the statute pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:175(A), the court struck that sentence of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ, declared the last sentence of the contraband statute to be unconstitutional, and struck such sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In certiorari proceedings, defendant tax collector appealed a decision from the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit (Louisiana), which, after affirming the trial court's denial of plaintiff taxpayer's petition for a refund of local sales and use tax, reversed the trial court's judgment regarding penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court required the taxpayer to pay interest at the rate of 15 percent, penalties in the amount of 25 percent of the outstanding tax, and attorney fees under Calcasieu Parish, La., School Board Ord. &sect; 6.09. The appellate court ruled that the combined interest and penalties could not exceed the 15 percent interest penalty permitted by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2746 when collecting delinquent sales and use taxes. The court reversed the appellate court's decision, concluding that in addition to the 15 percent interest penalty authorized under &sect; 33:2746, local taxing authorities could exercise their authority to levy and collect sales and use taxes within the meaning of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:2711-2715 to impose 25 percent penalties and 10 percent attorney fees as set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:1602, 47:5712 on delinquent taxes. The court overruled Elevating Boats v. St. Bernard Parish, 795 So. 2d 1153 (2001), to the extent that it held to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and company sought a writ of certiorari to determine whether rules promulgated by the New Orleans Civil Service Commission involving privatization contracts needed to be approved by the Commission prior to their implementation. The lower Louisiana appellate courts stated that Commission approval was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the city and company's writ to determine whether rules promulgated by the Commission, which required that privatization contracts entered into by the city must be reviewed and approved by the Commission prior to their implementation, were a constitutional exercise of the Commission's rulemaking authority under La. Const. art. X, &sect; 10. The court stated that the issue was whether New Orleans, La., Civ. Serv. Comm'n R. III, &sect;&sect; 6.1-6.4, under which the Commission claimed its authority to review and approve privatization contracts entered into by the mayor were laws permitted by the state constitution. The court stated that it agreed with the vast majority of courts that privatization did not necessarily run afoul of the constitutionally created civil service system. The court found that portions of &sect; 6.1-6.4, which gave the Commission the ex parte authority to suspend the effectiveness of such contracts entered into by the city for personal or professional services, were beyond the power that was granted to it by art. X, &sect; 10(A)(1), and therefore unconstitutional. However, the Commission rules that generally provided for commission review were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of the lower courts with regard to the preliminary injunction were affirmed. The case was remanded to the trial court to establish a deadline for the city to submit the agreement and its evidence to the Commission for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state tax commission (LTC) assessed appellee interstate pipeline companies ad valorem tax at 25 percent of the fair market value of their public service properties in Louisiana. The companies filed a protest, challenging the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;47:1851(K). The Court of Appeal of Louisiana, First Circuit, reversed the district court's judgment granting the LTC's exception of prematurity. The LTC appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies challenge to the rate of the taxation arose from the fact that intrastate pipeline companies did not qualify as &quot;public service properties,&quot; but were instead classified as &quot;other property,&quot; pursuant to La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 18(B). As a result of that classification, intrastate pipeline companies were assessed by local assessors at only 15 percent of the fair market value of their properties. The Supreme Court of Louisiana granted certiorari to consider whether original jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to certain Louisiana tax provisions relative to assessments of public service property for taxation purposes lay with the LTC or with Louisiana district courts. The supreme court found that Louisiana district courts had original jurisdiction over constitutional questions and held that a protest to a tax assessment based solely on a constitutional challenge had not been prematurely filed in the district court, even though the LTC had not yet issued a final determination of the companies assessed valuation. Because their protests were based on constitutional challenges, the public service property taxpayers' suits were not prematurely filed in district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed, and the case was remanded to the court of appeal for consideration of the LTC's exception of no cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the there was substantial evidence to support the finding of wilful neglect under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:443(A). Before the school board the principal testified that he had twice informed the staff of the escort policy and that the teacher had previously been remanded for violating it. The teacher refused to sign the disciplinary forms regarding her violations and claimed she was unaware of the policy. She also claimed that a secretary told her that escort was unnecessary on one occasion. The principal stated that the secretary denied making such a statement, and the teacher failed to produce the secretary to refute the testimony. The suggestion that the secretary should have testified interfered with the school board's role as fact finder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Board of Trustees of the Louisiana State Employees Retirement System (LASERS) appealed a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court (Louisiana), which found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:416.1, which pertained to reemployment packages available to plaintiffs, retired state employees who had been reemployed, was violative of the United States Constitution and the Louisiana Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature amended La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:416 to permit a reemployed retiree to receive a salary plus full retirement benefits after a 12-month waiting period, regain membership in LASERS, and earn a supplemental benefit, if reemployed for over 36 months. The following year, the legislature repealed the amendment and enacted La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:416.1, which applied specifically to the retirees who retired and been rehired during the 10-month interim period under the amended statute. Plaintiffs, who retired and been rehired during the interim period, asserted, and the trial court agreed, that &sect; 11:416.1 was unconstitutional, as it impaired their vested and contract rights. In reversing the trial court's decision, the court held that &sect; 11:416.1 did not violate La. Const. art. X, &sect; 29(E)(5), which prohibited the impairment of accrued benefits of members of any state retirement system, or the Contracts Clauses of the U.S. Constitution and the Louisiana Constitution. The court held that, because the law was changed prior to the time plaintiffs fulfilled the 12-month waiting period or were reemployed for 36 months, no accrued or vested rights were impaired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, granted defendants' motion to quash indictments, and declared unconstitutional all or portions of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 412, 413, and 414 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:114. The statutes provided procedures for selecting grand jurors, grand jury forepersons, and grand jury venires in Orleans Parish. The State sought review pursuant to La. Const. art. art. V, &sect; 5(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that former La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 412, 413, and 414 and former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:114 were unconstitutional local laws which separated Orleans Parish from the rest of the state of Louisiana, and created one method of criminal law for the City of New Orleans, and another method for criminal law for the remainder of the state. The appellate court found the statutes either wholly or in part specifically concerned only Orleans Parish grand jury proceedings. The complained of statutes were quite clearly unconstitutional local laws within the meaning of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 12. Former La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 412 (1999), and former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:114 were unconstitutional in their entireties. However, the language specific to Orleans Parish could be severed in former La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 413 and 414(1999), and therefore, the unconstitutionality of portions of the latter statutes did not render the entirety of the statutes unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. To the extent that the judgment of the trial court could conflict with the supreme court's opinion, if at all, it was overruled. The matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the supreme court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient, who received blood transfusions at the hospital after surgery, contracted hepatitis C from the transfusions. Twenty years later, the patient filed suit, alleging that the hospital should be held strictly liable. The trial court denied the hospital's exception of prescription, and the appellate court affirmed. In reversing the lower courts' decisions, the court held that strict liability actions were included under the plain language of &sect; 9:5628, which covered actions whether based upon, tort, or breach of contract, or &quot;otherwise.&quot; The court held that &sect; 9:5628 contained no qualifying or limiting language that would negate its application to a strict liability action brought against a hospital for an act arising out of patient care. The court also held that the application of &sect; 9:5628 to a plaintiff's claim did not depend upon whether the hospital was a private hospital qualified or not under the Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.41 et seq., or a public facility. The court did, however, remand the action to the trial court to give the patient the opportunity to amend his pleadings to assert the unconstitutionality of &sect; 9:5628 as it applied to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school boards filed an action against defendants, governor, treasurer, and state superintendent to prevent defendants from distributing money received from a tobacco settlement to any entities other than public schools. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, granted the school boards' request for a permanent injunction preventing the distribution of the funds. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1998, the State of Louisiana entered into a settlement agreement with several major tobacco companies. By constitutional amendments, certain proceeds of the settlement were dedicated to a special permanent trust. The Education Excellence Fund was one of three funds that was to receive the benefit of the money placed in the trust. The state sold a portion of the money to be received in the future to increase the current proceeds. One hundred percent of the money from the sale was to be deposited into the special trust. The school boards sought an injunction to prevent the State from distributing any of the principal of the money deposited into the Educational Excellence Fund to private schools. The trial court granted the injunction. The state supreme court affirmed and held that the provisions of La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10.8(A)(1)(d) enured solely to the benefit of the public schools. Thus, to the extent that 2002 La. Acts 26 appropriated a portion of the additional 10 percent of total monies received in 2001-2002 from the Education Excellence Fund to schools other than the public schools as provided for in La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10.8(C)(3)(d), it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee minority timber owners, owning a 17.5 percent interest, filed suit against appellant majority timber owner to annul a timber sale, arguing that, inter alia, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:4278.2 was unconstitutional. After a bench trial, the court rejected each of the minority's claims and ruled in favor of the majority owner. The Court of Appeal (Louisiana) reversed and found that &sect; 3:4278.2 was unconstitutional. The majority owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held that &sect; 3:4278.2 impermissibly allowed a quick taking of privately-owned property by private parties for private purposes, with no prior notice or opportunity to be heard. The majority owner argued that &sect; 3:4278.2 did not raise due process concerns because action by private landowners did not equate to state action and that even if action by the majority owners could have been construed as state action, the statute met the due process requirements for non-consenting co-owners. The Supreme Court of Louisiana found that there was no state action implicated by &sect; 3:4278.2. As state action was a necessary component of a procedural due process claim, the minority's claim of unconstitutionality failed under the relevant analysis. In the case sub judice, the record clearly established that the minority co-owners had actual notice of the proposed sale, thus, none of the minority co-owners were without notice of the sale of the timber or the opportunity to change any terms of the buyer-seller agreement. The majority acted in good faith in accordance to the statute, it had not acted as a tree pirate, and therefore, no damages were warranted under &sect; 3:4278.1(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court of appeal regarding the unconstitutionality of the article and damages awarded to the minority co-owners was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a superintendent and a principal, sought review of a trial court's decision that held them in contempt under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 224(2) for violating a temporary restraining order (TRO) that plaintiff student obtained, which prohibited defendants from excluding him from graduation exercises. The Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana), found that defendants were required to obey the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants informed the student a few days before graduation that he was not eligible for a diploma, as he was deficient one-half math credit. Thirty minutes before the graduation ceremony, defendants were served with a folder containing a TRO, but the signing judge's name was illegible, and it bore no filing stamp or docket number. Given the suspiciousness of the document and the fact that the student did not meet the academic requirements, defendants did not allow the student to participate. Thereafter, they were found in contempt of court. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the TRO was legally deficient under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. arts. 3603, 3604, 3605. No one gave defendants advanced notice, as required, that the student was pursuing judicial intervention to allow him to participate in graduation. The order failed to state why the order was granted without notice and hearing, and the fact that it was issued without security, as required by La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3610, was improper. Because the evidence failed to establish that defendants' actions were done with an intent to defy court authority, reversal of the contempt convictions was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, vacated, and set aside the order holding defendants in contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The towing company successfully argued the targeted statutes and administrative rules and regulations were preempted by federal law and were therefore unconstitutional. The trial court's judgment declared the targeted statutes and administrative rules and regulations were unconstitutional and enjoined the state from enforcing, applying, administering, relying upon, collecting, or levying fines, fees, or penalties based thereupon, or acting in any manner inconsistent with its ruling. The appellate court held the trial court's declaration of unconstitutionality was in effect a ruling on the merits of the towing company's petition for declaratory relief; however, there was nothing in the record to suggest that the parties agreed to try the declaratory action at the hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), declared La. Civ. Code. Ann. art. 136(B)&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to the situation, where grandparents were attempting to gain the visitation of their grandchild from their own child. Appellant grandparents appealed that judgment, pursuant to La. Const. Art. 5, &sect; 5(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that it was clear that La. Civ. Code. Ann. art. 136(B) contemplated a grant of reasonable visitation to relatives upon the divorce of the child's parents, if there were extraordinary circumstances and upon finding by the court that such an award was in the best interest of the child. However, the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that the challenge to the constitutionality of art. 136(B) had not been in the proper posture for the supreme court's review. There was clearly no evidence in the record to have indicated that the attorney general was served or notified of the challenge to the constitutionality of the statute so he could have elected whether or not to have exercised his statutory right to represent the state's interest in the proceeding prior to the trial court's declaration of unconstitutionality. Specifically, the record demonstrated that, at the inception of the matter, the domestic relations commissioner suggested that, as there were some questions of constitutionality, the attorney general's office did not need to be joined and that the definitive ruling should have come from the district judge, not the commissioner.</SPAN></P>

The Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), declared the statutes unconstitutional on grounds of equal protection, as they allegedly imposed a disproportionate financial burden on city's taxpayers compared to those in other political subdivisions. The fund appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court improperly found that the municipal defendants fell within the scope of protection of the equal protection clauses of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions. To the contrary, the city, as a political subdivision of the state rather than a &quot;person,&quot; was without the protections of La. Const. art. I, the Declaration of Rights, or the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court of Louisiana held that municipalities were not entitled to 14th Amendment protections. Correspondingly, La. Const. art. I protected only the rights of &quot;persons&quot; and did not protect government entities against unjust government action. Therefore, the trial court erred when it granted judgment in favor of the municipal defendants on grounds of the equal protection clause. As to the mayor's separate intervention as a city taxpayer, in which he asserted the unconstitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:1481, the supreme court noted that there was nothing in the trial court's written reasons for judgment or the judgment itself that indicated it had even reached the mayor's contentions as an individual separate from those of the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant truck driver sued appellee, the State of Louisiana, Department of Transportation and Development (the State), alleging that the enforcement and collection procedures set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:389 violated the constitutional rights of both resident and non-resident truck drivers. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) held &sect; 32:389 was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck driver was ticketed for failing to stop at a stationary weight enforcement scale, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:388. Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:389, the truck driver, as a non-Louisiana resident, was required to pay the fine or face impoundment of his truck. The truck driver alleged the State placed an unfair burden upon non-residents in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The State responded to the truck driver's petition by filing an exception of prescription. The prescription exception averred that the truck driver's suit was not filed within 90 days of payment of the assessed penalty as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:389(C)(4)(a). During the pendency of the proceeding, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:389 was amended. The trial court found both versions of &sect; 32:389&nbsp;unconstitutional. The appellate court held the trial court should not have entertained the truck driver's summary judgment motions prior to resolution of the threshold issues of prescription and standing. Under the circumstances, any declaration of unconstitutionality by the district court was an impermissible advisory opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of the district court granting the truck driver's motion for partial summary judgment, and second motion for partial summary judgment, were vacated and set aside.

An opportunity to fully brief and argue the issue would have provided the trial court with thoughtful and complete arguments relative to the issue of constitutionality and furnished the reviewing court with an adequate record upon which to adjudge the constitutionality of the statute. The court of appeal did not have a record on the issue of constitutionality, nor did it have the benefit of briefing and argument on the issue by the parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A man was seriously injured when the car he was driving was hit by an intoxicated driver.

In a subsequent tort suit, $ 500,000 in exemplary damages were assessed against the intoxicated driver pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315.4. The appellate court granted review to consider the appropriate standard of review to apply in evaluating the amount of exemplary damages awarded by a trial court in light of the federal constitution's due process clause. The appellate court applied the BMW factors. Given the driver's recidivism and grossly reckless and wanton behavior bordering on being intentional, the $ 500,000 exemplary damage award was not so clearly against the evidence as to constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted separately for aggravated rape. Both defendants filed motions for an admissibility hearing after the State gave notice of its intent to introduce evidence of other sex offenses under art. 412.2. In the first defendant's case, the first trial court granted defendant's motion, concluded that Prieur jurisprudence was applicable to art. 412.2, and held that the evidence of other sex offenses should be subject to a pretrial hearing on admissibility. Conversely, the second trial court denied the second defendant's motion for a hearing. According to defendants, art. 412.2 contained a requirement that a trial court hold a Prieur hearing prior to trial to determine whether the other sex offenses sought to be introduced by the State were admissible at trial. Defendants complained that the lack of a pretrial hearing deprived their attorney of the ability to prepare a defense and could result in ineffective assistance of counsel. After reviewing the records and applicable law, the supreme court held that the procedural requirements of Prieur, which required a trial court to hold a pre-trial hearing prior to admitting evidence, did not apply to art. 412.2.</SPAN></P>

The Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge( Louisiana) held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5107(D), as enacted in 1996, was unconstitutional, in that it violated the parent's right to due process and to equal protection of the law, and denied defendants' declinatory exception of improper service.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent filed her suit in September 1997, but requested that service be withheld. In July 1998, the parent requested that defendants be served. Service was accomplished upon defendants in August 1998. Relying on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5107(D) (1996), defendants argued that the parent's suit should have been dismissed without prejudice, as she failed to request service of citation within 90 days of filing the petition. The trial court ruled that &sect; 13:5107(D) (1996) was unconstitutional, apparently because the statute did not provide for a good cause hearing. The Louisiana Supreme Court held that, given the parent could not show good cause for her failure to timely request service, she could not prevail on her contention that she was treated differently under the 1996 version of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5107(D) than she would have been under the 1998 version of that statute.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5107(D)(2) (1998) referred to La. Code Civ. P. art. 1672(C), which allowed a party to make a showing of &quot;good cause&quot; why service could not be requested. That provision was absent from La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5107(D) (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court declaring the 1996 version of the applicable statute governing service of process unconstitutional was vacated and set aside. The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following voter approval of a city minimum wage law, petitioner proponents and petitioner opponents each instituted declaratory actions against respondent city regarding the validity of the new minimum wage law. The cases were consolidated and the Civil District Court, New Orleans Parish, Louisiana, declared La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:642&nbsp;unconstitutional and upheld the minimum wage law. The opponents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the opponents argued that regulation of minimum wages under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:642 was a valid exercise of the state's police power as it was enacted for the purpose of protecting the general economic welfare of the state as a whole and, therefore, New Orleans, La., Ordinance 20376, could not stand. At trial, expert economists voiced disagreement with the findings of the legislature regarding the need for statewide consistency in regulation of minimum wage rates. The supreme court held that it was the legislature's function to fashion policy from these competing viewpoints, not the trial court's. By choosing to give the evidence presented by one side more weight than that presented by the other, the trial court improperly second-guessed the legislature. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:642, prohibiting local governmental subdivisions from establishing a minimum wage was a legitimate exercise of the state's police power. Accordingly, the supreme court concluded that the city's minimum wage law, which set a minimum wage rate private employers were required to pay their employees, abridged the police power of the state; thus, the minimum wage law was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were each charged with first degree murder. The Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) quashed the indictment, finding: (1) that defendants presented a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of grand jury forepersons in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (2) that former La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 413(C) was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted that the Supreme Court of Louisiana had jurisdiction pursuant to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(D)(1). However, after reviewing the record and applicable law, the supreme court found that it lacked jurisdiction under art. V, &sect; 5(D)(1), and transferred the case to the fourth circuit court of appeal. Because the trial court did not declare former La. Const. art. 413(C) unconstitutional on its face, but only held that the law was applied in a discriminatory manner in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, jurisdiction was proper as to those issues only in the court of appeal. In the case at bar, having found that former art. 413(C) was unconstitutionally applied in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and quashing the indictments on that basis, the trial judge should have refrained from also determining that former art. 413(C) was unconstitutional under La. Const. art. III, &sect; 12(a)(3), as a local or special law because resolution of that issue was not essential to the decision of the case or controversy. The district court was premature in reaching the issue of constitutionality and any further statements by it concerning the constitutionality of the statute were dicta.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ruling of the trial court declaring a statute former unconstitutional as a local or special law was vacated and the case was transferred to the fourth circuit court of appeal to be treated as an appeal by the state and defendants on all other grounds properly raised.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with possession of crack cocaine. Defendant entered a plea of not guilty and moved to suppress the evidence. The trial court suppressed the evidence and released defendant. The State's motion for a stay was denied. The Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, denied the State's application for supervisory writs and request for a stay order. Certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Vice detectives entered a bar for the purpose of conducting a vice check. Defendant got up from a booth and attempted to walk away. The officer stopped him, and the officer's partner retrieved four pieces of what appeared to be crack cocaine from the booth area. On appeal, the relevant inquiry was whether, at the time defendant abandoned the crack cocaine, the police officers illegally accomplished an actual or imminent actual stop. The vice unit had no authority whatsoever to enter a bar and search its patrons for narcotics. Nevertheless, the record contained no indication that the officers made any attempt to search defendant, or any other patron, for narcotics. At the point defendant discarded the crack cocaine, an actual stop of defendant was not imminent. Once the officers observed defendant's nervous behavior and saw him discard something off the booth seat and then attempt to walk away, they had at least reasonable cause to believe defendant was engaged in criminal conduct and could therefore stop him and retrieve the discarded evidence. The trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to suppress the crack cocaine and in finding a lack of probable cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's determination that the evidence should be suppressed and its finding of a lack of probable cause was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff casino association and members sued defendant state. The 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, declared La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 18:1505.2(L)(3)(a)(ii), 18:1505.2(L)(3)(b)(c)(e), insofar as they applied to &sect; 18:1505.2(L)(3)(a)(ii), (iii), unconstitutional, and likewise La. Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1505.2(L) prohibited campaign contributions by riverboat and land-based casino industries. The supreme court found that the First and Fourteenth Amendments were not violated. Spending for political ends and contributing to political candidates both fell within the First Amendment's protection of speech and political association. Although governmental action that could curtail freedom to associate was subject to the closest scrutiny, the right to participate in political activities was not absolute. Even a significant State interference could be sustained, if the State demonstrated a sufficiently important interest and employed means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of freedoms. As the restrictions here involved only 1 land-based casino and 15 riverboat facilities, the ban would minimally effect candidates' ability to amass resources necessary for effective advocacy. That the ban was a prohibition, rather than limitation, on contributions did not render it per se unconstitutional. Prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption was a constitutionally sufficient justification for campaign contribution restrictions.</SPAN></P>

The incidents culminated in one defendant pouring gasoline on the two African-American males' cars, with the intent to set the cars on fire, while one of the vehicles was occupied by one victim's three-year-old son. The inquiry of whether it was foreseeable that human life might be endangered (and therefore that defendants' actions constituted an aggravated arson) was conducted by the sentencing judge. Because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:54 removed from the jury the consideration of the elements of the underlying arson offense, defendants met their burden of proving that &sect; 14:54 was unconstitutional in that it violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by depriving a criminal defendant of a right to a jury determination that he was guilty of every element of the crime with which he was charged, beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying a motion to quash sentencing and a motion in arrest of judgment, wherein defendants argued that &sect; 14:54 was unconstitutional, and the appellate court erred in affirming their convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

Affording juvenile offenders the right to trial by jury would tend to destroy the flexibility of the juvenile judge as the trier of fact, which allowed the judge to take into consideration social and psychological factors, family background, and education in order to shape the disposition in the best interest of both the child and society. The supreme court followed the rulings from the United States Supreme Court and the vast majority of other jurisdictions on the issue, and held a trial by jury in a juvenile proceeding was not constitutionally required under the applicable due process standard in juvenile proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to determine whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 23:1225(C)(1)(b) permitted the employer to reduce the weekly workers' compensation benefits paid to a disabled worker, if the worker also received old age Social Security benefits under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 401 et seq. The worker argued that the statute was discriminatory, as it treated older workers differently by stripping them of workers' compensation benefits when their ability to work was taken away by a work-related accident. The court found that the employer and the State, who filed a brief arguing in favor of constitutionality, failed to prove that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 23:1225(C)(1)(b) substantially furthered an appropriate governmental objective of coordinating wage loss replacement to prevent the duplication of benefits. The statute arbitrarily, capriciously, and unreasonably discriminated against persons age 65 and older, and unconstitutionally denied them equal protection of the laws under La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power plant requested a local ad valorem property tax rate of 15 percent of its property's fair market value. The tax commission responded that the power plant was public service property, which was assessed centrally by the State at a property tax rate of 25 percent. The power plant successfully appealed the determination in the trial court. The tax commission appealed, arguing a wholesale electric power generating plant was an electric power company, thus its property constituted public service properties, as defined in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1851(M). The power plant argued because there was no wholesale market for electricity when the statutes governing ad valorem taxes was passed it could not be presumed the legislature intended to include such an operation in the statutory definition. The supreme court held if a tax statute was susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, the construction favorable to the taxpayer was to be adopted. The supreme court concluded by legislative definition referring to the use of the property, the power plant was not a public service property subject to the higher tax rate.</SPAN></P>

They presented no credible reason why, after all the years since 1974, any further delay would cause injustice sufficient to justify the issuance of a writ of mandamus.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with various violations of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:333, the statute that governed the commercial taking of mullet. The 34th Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Bernard (Louisiana) found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:333(F) violated due process and equal protection clauses, as well as the constitutional provisions prohibiting excessive punishment. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that, notwithstanding defendants' claims to the contrary, their status as commercial fishermen did not constitute a suspect class, nor did commercial fishing amount to a fundamental right. The lifetime ban set out in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:333(F) had a rational purpose, namely, to operate as a shield against the depletion of the local mullet supply by targeting fishermen who made the most concentrated catches of mullet. To prove a violation of substantive due process, defendants were required to establish the existence of a constitutionally-protected property or liberty interest. The penalty provision of the statute was rationally related to the legislature's express purpose of enhancing the state's mullet fishery; therefore, defendants' due process challenge lacked merit. Finally, the penalty was not meted out arbitrarily or capriciously given that the same punishment was found in the statutes concerning spotted seatrout and saltwater finfish. Clearly, the determination was within the province of the legislature. The sentencing provision under the statute was not unconstitutionally excessive, and the trial court erred in holding otherwise.</SPAN></P>

The amendment was applied retroactively to the employee's claim, since it was procedural, rather than substantive. The amendment reflected Louisiana's public policy to allow adjudication of claims properly filed in its courts. The retroactive application of this amendment did not unconstitutionally disturb a vested right, since there was no vested right in any given mode of procedure, and the amendment concerned a procedural matter. The retroactive application of the amendment also did not unconstitutionally impair the employment contract because no substantive right of the parties was modified, and a legitimate public purpose justified this regulation of the parties' responsibilities, was based on reasonable conditions, and was of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying the amendment's adoption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An off-duty sheriff's deputy stopped defendant after he saw defendant's car crossing the center and fog lines of a road. In response to the deputy's call, a state trooper arrived and transported defendant to a prison where an Intoxilyzer test revealed defendant was legally intoxicated. The trial court placed defendant on active probation conditioned on home incarceration. The appellate court, 16 months after the initial sentencing, found that this was an improper sentence and ordered the trial court to resentence defendant. On appeal, the supreme court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:301.1 could be applied retroactively, that the Louisiana Legislature's specific limitation on Jackson and its progeny did not violate defendant's constitutional right to appeal his conviction, and that the time limitations recognized in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:301.1(D) were inapplicable. Therefore, defendant could be resentenced.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that the co-owner invoked the district court's appellate jurisdiction, and that it was improper for the district court to have received evidence when acting in an appellate capacity. The court of appeal correctly concluded that the district court lacked appellate jurisdiction because the board's order was not final.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with theft of more than $ 100 but less than $ 500 from a merchant, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67.10. The Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, held that this statute was unconstitutional, granted defendant's motion to quash, and released him. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67.10, involving thefts from merchants, the potential penalties were greater than under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67, dealing with thefts from all other victims. The trial court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67.10&nbsp;unconstitutionally denied equal protection by treating merchants differently than other victims. The appellate court disagreed. Statutory discrimination based on the status of the victim required the lowest level of scrutiny in the equal protection analysis. In order to show unconstitutionality, defendant had the burden to show that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67.10 did not further any appropriate state interest, and he failed to meet that burden. Merchants and other businesses were not similarly situated as to the economic problem of shoplifting. The two statutes were therefore warranted in providing dissimilar punishments against one class of defendants based on the status of the victim as a merchant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient sued appellee hospital, alleging strict liability in tort and negligence. The trial court dismissed her claims on the basis that they had prescribed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628, which it found to be constitutional. The Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, Parish of Jackson, Louisiana, affirmed. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fifteen years after the patient received a blood transfusion, she learned she had hepatitis C, probably caused by the 1980 transfusion. Though her claim was filed less than one year after she discovered her cause of action, the trial court held that it was prescribed by the three-year limitation of the medical malpractice prescriptive statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628, as it was filed more than three years after the transfusion. The trial court held that &sect; 9:5628 was constitutional, and the court of appeal affirmed. The instant court did not reach the constitutionality issue. It overruled Boutte v. Jefferson Parish Hospital Service District No. 1, 759 So. 2d 45 (La. 2000), which held that a strict products liability claim arising out of a defective blood transfusion was within the scope of &sect; 9:5628. Pre-1982, pre-blood shield statutes, claims against hospitals in strict products liability arising out of defective blood transfusions were not malpractice claims governed by &sect; 9:5628, but were governed by the general tort prescriptive statute,&nbsp;La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3492. The patient's strict liability claims were thus not prescribed, although her malpractice claims were.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Neither the total exclusion of a cognizable group from the jury nor the mere presence of one or two token members of the group on the jury was dispositive of whether the prima facie requirement of race or gender discrimination was satisfied. Defendant's reliance on bare statistics to support a prima facie case of both gender and race discrimination was misplaced. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Given the potential for confusion coupled with the arguable lack of relevance, the supreme court found that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding the bite mark photographs from evidence. Furthermore, the record amply supported the three aggravating factors returned by the jury. Finally, the evidence of rape, combined with the victim's age (less than two years old), strongly supported the decision that death was not a disproportionate penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Louisiana Public Facilities Authority (LPFA) sought a declaration that 1999 La.

The 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) granted it summary judgment; an injunction against the Acts' enforcement; and found part of Act 11, and the others, unconstitutional. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LPFA, a non-profit public trust and public corporation, was created under the authority the Public Trust Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2341 et seq, by the Public Facilities Corporation, as settlor. The indenture of trust dated August 1974, under which it was created, named the state as beneficiary. Act 915 required the LPFA to submit its budget to the legislature. Act 1238 increased the number of trustees and required their approval by the senate. Act 1323 limited per diems payable to trustees and restricted reimbursements to them. One of Act 11's line items appropriated $ 5 million for a program provided the LPFA send that amount to the State Treasury. The Louisiana Supreme Court held that the LPFA was not protected by La. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, the contracts clause, because it was a public entity, not a private citizen. Act 1238 did not violate La. Const. art. III, &sect; 15, which required the amended version of the bill to be pertinent to the bill as introduced. Act 11 did not violate La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner brought a personal injury action against the State of Louisiana, and its Department of Corrections (DOC). The trial court denied the State's exception of abandonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was seriously injured while working at a prison, and filed suit against the State in the district court in the parish where the injury occurred.

The instant court held that the Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure, La. Rev. Stat.

Under &sect; 15:1171, a district court was obliged to give &quot;manifest error rule&quot; deference to a DOC adjudication, which it could reverse only on grounds such as arbitrary or capricious behavior, abuse of discretion, or manifest error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (LDHH) filed this direct appeal from the judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which declared unconstitutional&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1414 (which mandated termination of classified employees upon conviction for a felony).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found La. Rev. Stat. An. &sect; 42:1414, which mandated the immediate termination of classified employees convicted of felonies, to be unconstitutional. Appellee Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (LDHH) filed this direct appeal from that judgment. The Louisiana Supreme Court noted that &sect; 42:1414 equated conviction of a felony during employment as a mandatory &quot;cause&quot; for termination from service; thus the legislature usurped the executive Civil Service Commission's exclusive authority granted by La. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 8, 10, and 12, to define the misconduct and behavior which constituted cause for disciplining a classified employee. However, the court did find that &sect; 42:1414 was constitutional as it affected unclassified state employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That part of the district court judgment which found that La. Rev. Stat.

The appellate court found that the prosecution's peremptory challenges were not race-based and defendant did nothing to demonstrate that the State intended to discriminate against African-American jurors. Next, the appellate court found that the State presented sufficient evidence to convict defendant of two counts of first degree murder. Also, the appellate court found that the case warranted the principals jury instruction because the evidence indicated that defendant was involved in the commission of the offenses along with two other people. Finally, the appellate court found that it had overwhelmingly upheld death sentences in cases where a defendant created the risk of death or great harm to more than one person. Thus, the death sentence imposed in defendant's case was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI), third offense, and he appealed. The Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, held that the statutory provision permitting seizure and sale of his vehicle after his third DWI conviction was constitutional. Defendant filed a writ of certiorari to the intermediate appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of DWI. Because it was his third conviction, his vehicle was seized, impounded, and sold. The State's interests in forfeiture of the defendant's automobile after his third DWI conviction were apparent: (1) the lack of compliance with the law as set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98; (2) the high incidence of motor-vehicle accidents involving drunk drivers; (3) the reduction of deaths and injuries that usually result from motor vehicle accidents involving drunk drivers; and (4) the evident risk of the defendant continuing to drive while intoxicated, as it was at least his third offense. The State's interests were significant. Those interests justified depriving defendant of his vehicle. Thus, the supreme court concluded that the seizure and impoundment of defendant's automobile was a reasonable exercise of police power and the statute met all constitutional mandates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the lower courts' decisions finding that the DWI forfeiture statute, which provided for the forfeiture of the defendant's vehicle upon conviction of a third DWI offense did not violate the Louisiana Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city sought review of the order of the Louisiana trial court that granted the motion of appellants, a slip and fall claimant and his wife, to strike the city's request for a jury trial. The city alleged that the trial court erred in declaring La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:4521, 13:4581, and 13:5105(D)&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was injured in a slip and fall accident in a garage owned by the city, and he and his spouse sued the city. The city filed a jury demand under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105(C). Thereafter, the instant court declared &sect; 13:5105(C) to be unconstitutional. The claimants moved to strike the jury demand, on grounds that the city had failed to post a jury bond, and that &sect; 13:5105(D) was unconstitutional. The city argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4521 exempted it from paying court costs, and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4581 exempted it from posting any bond. The trial court granted the claimants' motion to strike on the grounds that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:4521, 13:4581, and 13:5105(D) were unconstitutional. The city appealed. The instant court vacated the judgment to the extent that it held those statutes to be unconstitutional. As the city's only request for a jury trial was made under &sect; 13:5105(C), which was later held unconstitutional, the claimants' motion to strike should have been resolved on the grounds that the city waived its right to a jury. The trial court erred by unnecessarily reaching constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff's legal malpractice claim against defendants, defendants filed exceptions of prescription under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605. The trial court found &sect; 9:5605 did not apply, and, under the continuous representation rule, contra non valentem suspended prescription. The Court of Appeal, First Circuit, East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana) affirmed, and the supreme court granted supervisory writs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant law firm discovered alleged fraud and asserted state and federal fraud claims, on behalf of plaintiff and another. The suit was dismissed, the dismissal was affirmed on appeal, and certiorari was denied. The suit's dismissal raised questions if defendant law firm should have filed a Fed. R.  Civ. P. 60(b) motion. Under the civil code articles regarding liberative prescription, plaintiff's legal malpractice claim was a delictual action subject to a liberative prescription period of one year from injury or damage. That period could be suspended in certain cases under the continuous representation rule, which generally suspended prescription of a client's claim against an attorney during the attorney's continuous representation of the client. However, that rule did not automatically apply to the attorney-client relationship between plaintiff and defendant law firm, as plaintiff did not innocently rely on defendant's advice but was informed by another attorney of his malpractice claim against defendant. Since plaintiff actively questioned defendant's performance, contra non valentem did not apply to his malpractice claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeal was reversed because the continuous representation rule did not apply to suspend the prescription of plaintiff's legal malpractice claim against defendant, as plaintiff had been advised he had such a claim by another attorney. Judgment was rendered in favor of defendants and against plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff shipbuilders brought personal injury suit against defendant companies in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana). Defendants challenged plaintiffs' medical monitoring expenses claim after the Louisiana Legislature passed an enactment barring such claims. The trial court found the enactment unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs' claims. Defendants appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed they would require medical monitoring because of exposure to asbestos. After plaintiffs' suit was filed, the Louisiana Legislature enacted 1999 La. Acts 989, which eliminated recovery for medical monitoring expenses for claimants in plaintiffs' situation. Defendants argued the enactment barred plaintiffs' claim. The trial court ruled the enactment was unconstitutional as to plaintiffs' claims. The appellate court found the Louisiana Legislature intended that 1999 La. Acts 989 be applied to plaintiffs' claims. However, plaintiffs had a vested right to assert their causes of action for medical monitoring as those rights accrued prior to the effective date of the enactment. Therefore, their vested right could not constitutionally be divested by retroactive application of 1999 La. Acts 989.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the trial court declaring the enactment unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs' claims was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant firearms manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and trade associations, appealed from decision of the Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, which held that it was unconstitutional to apply La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1799 and &sect; 9:2800.6 to retroactively divest plaintiffs, the City and mayor of New Orleans, of their right to sue manufacturers for economic harm suffered from citizen use of firearms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed suit against defendants to recover damages for the provision of police, medical, emergency, and other services required due to citizen use of firearms. Subsequent to the filing of plaintiffs' petition, the legislature enacted 1999 La. Acts 291, to preclude suits from being filed by local governments against firearms manufacturers. Defendants filed a preemptory exception, contending that the retroactive application of 1999 La. Acts 291, &sect; 1 (codified at La. Rev. Stat. Ann &sect; 40:1799) divested plaintiffs of a right of action. Defendants appealed from the finding that retroactive application was unconstitutional as to plaintiffs. The supreme court held that the enactment of Act 291 subsequent to the filing of plaintiffs' suit was of no moment, because the City lacked the protections of La. Const. art. I, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Contract Clauses of both the Federal and State Constitutions. Moreover, since Act 291 constituted a reasonable exercise of the State's police power, the continuation of the suit abridged the police power of the State in contravention of La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9(B). Finally, Act 291 operated as a general law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's conclusion that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1799 was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs, sustained defendants' exception of no right of action, and dismissed plaintiffs' action. The court also vacated and set aside the trial court's conclusions relating to the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9:2800.60.</SPAN></P>

The State filed a writ of certiorari to review that court's decision, which the Louisiana Supreme Court granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a pre-trial motion the State sought to introduce evidence of defendant's unadjudicated rape of another girl allegedly committed 16 years earlier. No charges were made against defendant in the earlier rape after the victim withdrew her claims of sexual abuse. The district court found this evidence to be admissible, noting that lustful disposition evidence may be relevant to the element of specific intent. The appellate court found the evidence was inadmissible. The Louisiana Supreme Court found evidence of lustful disposition was not admissible unless it was to prove some element of the charged offense and not to prove defendant's bad character. The State's other crimes evidence fit none of the permitted purposes enumerated in La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 404(B) as the evidence sought to be introduced did not bear upon an essential element of the offense, and because motive, intent, and identity were not genuinely at issue, evidence that the defendant had allegedly raped another girl was but another way of demonstrating that he had the propensity to commit the crime and that the act charged against him probably occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the court of appeals was affirmed because the other crimes evidence sought to be introduced was not independently relevant under any permitted purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved a determination of whether the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) was to be held liable to a motorist because of the placement of a 90-foot longitudinal guardrail on a road shoulder just before a railroad crossing. Plaintiff was transporting a load of 80,000 pounds of asphalt for his employer. Plaintiff attempted to take evasive action, but the placement of the longitudinal guardrail directed his truck into the path of the train and deprived him of his only avenue of escape. The supreme court found no manifest error in the trial court's determination that the cab of plaintiff's truck impacted the guardrail prior to striking the train. The appellate court clearly substituted its opinion for that of the trial court on this question. The trial court was presented with sufficient, credible evidence to determine that the guardrail redirected plaintiff's tank truck into the path of the train and eliminated the means for him to avoid collision with the train.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee councilwoman appealed an advisory ruling of appellant Louisiana Board of Ethics to the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, which reversed. The board appealed. The case was consolidated with that of appellant law firm, which, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1142(A), had sought direct review of an advisory opinion of the board, and appealed from the court of appeals' judgment affirming the board's opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A politician and a law firm got unhelpful advisory opinions from the Board of Ethics. The politician sought review from the trial court, but it dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. While her appeal to the lower appellate court was pending, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1142(A) was amended to subject such advisory opinions to appellate court jurisdiction. The lower appellate court reversed, and the board appealed. Meanwhile, the law firm appealed the board's opinion to the lower appellate court, which affirmed on grounds that the board's opinion was correct. The law firm's appeal from this ruling was consolidated with the board's appeal in the other case. The instant court ruled that the portion of &sect; 42:1142(A) that subjected the board's advisory opinions to appellate jurisdiction was unconstitutional as contrary to La. Const. art. 10, &sect; 21, which provided for appeals of board &quot;decisions.&quot; Advisory opinions were not reviewable &quot;decisions,&quot; as they did not involve justiciable controversies. The judgment denying the law firm's writ was affirmed, and the judgment reversing the board in the politician's cased was reversed, as the lower appellate court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower appellate court that denied a writ in the law firm's case was affirmed, but on different grounds. The writ should have been denied because the lower appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review advisory opinions of the board. The ruling of the lower appellate court that reversed the board's advisory opinion in the politician's case was reversed for the same reason.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court consolidated two cases which came up on writ of certiorari from the Louisiana Courts of Appeal, Fifth Circuit, Parish of Jefferson and the Fourth Circuit, Parish of St. Bernard, both of which raised the issue whether retroactive application of Louisiana's sex offender registration law, Louisiana's Megan Law, violated the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In anticipation of good time release defendant, who had been convicted of rape, filed a motion to be relieved of his duty to comply with sexual offender notice requirements of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:542. His motion and subsequent writ application to the court of appeals were denied. In a separate proceeding, a defendant who had been convicted of oral sexual battery, filed a motion in opposition to probation conditions that he comply with sexual offender notice requirements of La. Code.  Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 895(H). His motion was denied, and denial was affirmed by the court of appeals. The two cases were consolidated on grant of certiorari. The supreme court noted that Louisiana's Megan Law was encompassed by the two challenged statutory provisions and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:574.4(H)(2). Adopting the jurisprudential interpretation of the federal Ex Post Facto Clause to interpretation of the Louisiana clause, it held that Louisiana's Megan Law did not alter the definition of criminal conduct, was enacted with remedial not punitive intent, and imposed obligations not as additional punishment but as conditions of release. There was, thus, no ex post facto infraction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of both trial courts agreeing that there was no ex post facto violation. It lifted the stay it had imposed as to the defendant rapist who had been granted good time release subject to supervision, and remanded his case to the board of parole. It also lifted the stay the district court had imposed as to the defendant sexual batterer on active probation and remanded to that court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five days after the Columbine shooting in Colorado, defendant, a 15-year-old student, told a female classmate how easy it would be for him to shoot groups of students he disliked. In separate incidents, two male students asked him if was going to blow up the school, and he said that he was. He was arrested and charged with violations of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:40.1(A), making a false threat of violence, and &sect; 14:54.1(A), communicating false information about arson or bombing. The trial court adjudicated him a delinquent, finding violations of both statutes. The intermediate appellate court reversed, finding insufficient evidence to support the adjudications. The supreme court reversed the adjudication as to &sect; 14:40.1(A), as the State failed to prove an essential element of the charge: that defendant caused fear in others or public disruption. But it affirmed the adjudication as to &sect; 14:54.1(A) because the evidence had been sufficient to convict on this charge, as defendant's subjective intent to cause fear was not an element of the crime. The supreme court also rejected defendant's claim that this statute was unconstitutionally overbroad or vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment as to making a false threat of violence was affirmed because the State failed to prove that defendant's statement caused fear or public disruption.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a judgment of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Evangeline (Louisiana), finding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:9025(B)(2), 47:9070, which prohibited the sale or purchase of lottery tickets to persons under 21 years of age, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:319, which prohibited the playing or operating of video poker devices by persons under 21 years of age, violated La. Const. art. I &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff young man attempted to play video poker at a club. Plaintiff club owner informed plaintiff young man that he was prohibited from operating the video poker device because he was under 21 years of age. That same day, plaintiff young man entered a convenience store. He was not allowed to purchase a lottery ticket from plaintiff store owner because of his age. Plaintiffs filed a class action suit against the State. The district court declared unconstitutional the three Louisiana statutes that placed minimum age requirements on individuals who wished to purchase lottery tickets and/or operate video poker devices. Judgment was reversed. After finding that plaintiffs had standing to challenge the subject statutes, the court held the statutes were constitutional. The State's goal of protecting young adults from their vulnerabilities, protecting public health and general welfare, and preserving the gaming industry were appropriate governmental purposes. The evidence showed that removing 18 to 20 year-old persons from the group of adults who were allowed to participate in the lottery system and operate video poker devices would substantially further the State's valid objectives.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed; legislature's decision to raise the minimum age for purchasing lottery tickets and operating video poker was substantially related to the protection of the general welfare of the State. The State proved that the discriminating legislation substantially furthered an important governmental objective. Accordingly, the appellate court overruled the district court's ruling that three gaming statutes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a writ of certiorari challenging a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Fifth Circuit, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana) which affirmed a jury verdict convicting defendant of possession of a firearm while in possession of a controlled dangerous substance; to wit, marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When officers went to defendant's home to execute a search warrant, defendant told them he had a small amount of marijuana in the house and a pistol. The pistol was located in a kitchen cabinet. A bag with a small amount of marijuana was found under a sofa cushion and two marijuana cigarettes were found in an ashtray. Defendant was convicted and sentenced for possessing the marijuana and firearm. On appeal, defendant claimed that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95(E) was unconstitutional in its application because it provided an enhanced penalty for the constructive possession of a firearm and drugs without a showing of connection between the drugs and weapon. He claimed &sect; 14:95(E) was overbroad in violation of his right to bear arms and violated his equal protection rights by arbitrarily including a misdemeanor drug offender in the same class with felony drug offenders without serving a legitimate state purpose. Because the jury was not properly instructed that the State had to prove some connection between the gun found in the kitchen cabinet and defendant's possession of the marijuana found in the living room, judgment was reversed in part and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed in part, and reversed in part. Because jury was not properly instructed on key issue in case, a new trial was ordered. Because defendant was found to be in constructive possession of a firearm while simultaneously possessing marijuana, the State was required to prove there was a nexus between the firearm and the controlled dangerous substance. The relevant statute was neither overbroad nor an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After, securing a money judgment in Texas against defendants, plaintiff filed a petition to make her Texas judgment executory under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4241 et seq. The district court ruled for defendants and the appellate court affirmed the judgment. On certiorari review, the supreme court reversed the judgment of the appellate court. The supreme court held the Texas courts did establish jurisdiction over defendants, did afford them due process of law, and did render a judgment in Texas that became final and enforceable in Texas. Further, the supreme court concluded that judgment was entitled to enforcement in Louisiana by virtue of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The supreme court advised that defendants were free to ignore the original service of the Texas proceedings, risk a default judgment, and then challenge that judgment on jurisdictional grounds in a collateral proceeding. However, by submitting to the jurisdiction of the Texas court for the limited purpose of challenging jurisdiction, defendants agreed to abide by that court's determination on the issue of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part. That part of the articles was intended to, did and could only apply to the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), and so was a local law. Local laws operated only in a particular locality and did not have the possibility of extended coverage to other localities or areas if requisite criterion could never come to exist.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three consolidated criminal appeals, the State sought reversal, through writs of review, of decisions of the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which affirmed trial court orders placing defendants into the state's Drug Court Probation Program pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5304.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over the State's objections, each of the three defendants was placed into Louisiana's Drug Court Probation Program (program) pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5304. The State appealed, arguing that a defendant could enter the program only if the district attorney recommended such disposition. The first-level appellate court affirmed the decisions. In a consolidated appeal, brought via petitions for writs of review, the state supreme court reversed the lower court's decisions. First, though appeals were mooted by defendants' subsequent conduct, the court proceeded to review the matter as capable of repetition yet evading review. Although the Legislature chose to omit from the statute specific language granting the district attorney the sole right to recommend defendants for drug court probation, taken as a whole, the structure and language of the statute supported the State's argument. Only upon receipt of the district attorney's recommendation could a court consider a defendant's eligibility for such program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decisions affirming trial court decisions placing defendants on drug court probation over the State's objections reversed. While the applicable state statutes left the sentencing function to the court, the plea bargaining and screening functions were left to the sole prerogative of the district attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the ruling of the Fifteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Acadia (Louisiana), which denied defendants' motion to strike plaintiff's jury demand and held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:5105 was an unconstitutional denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendants city and certain police and sheriff's officers for personal injuries suffered in a collision with a vehicle being pursued by the officers. Plaintiffs submitted a jury demand, and defendants filed motions to strike the demand. In response, plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:5105, which prohibited a jury trial against a political subdivision. The trial court granted the motion, based on a violation of equal protection. The court of appeals reversed, holding that the trial court erred in basing its ruling on the section of the statute prohibiting jury trials when plaintiffs did not challenge that section, and as the section allowing for waiver of the prohibition was permissive only and had not implemented in the case, it should not have been ruled upon by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court judgment vacated and matter remanded. The trial court based its ruling on an inapplicable section of the statute in question, and in addition there was no justiciable controversy because defendant city had not yet chosen to implement the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State appealed the 19th Judicial District Court, for the Parish of East Baton Rouge's (Louisiana) permanent injunction and declaration that the portions of 1999 La. Acts 1266 that amended La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 47:301(10)(a)(iii), (18)(a)(iii) were unconstitutional violations of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 2(A)(2), in plaintiff Louisiana municipal association's suit to enjoin exclusion of certain tangible personalty from local taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1999 La. Acts 1266 amended La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 47:301 to exclude from local sales and use taxes any tangible personal property purchased for lease or rent. Plaintiff Louisiana municipal association sued to enjoin the enforcement of portions of Act 1266 and for declaratory relief that those portions were unconstitutional to the extent they created an exclusion from local sales and use tax in violation of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 2(A)(2). The trial court granted a permanent injunction and declared unconstitutional the portions of Act 1266 that amended La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 47:301(10)(a)(iii), (18)(a)(iii). The court reversed and dismissed plaintiff's action. 1993 La. Acts 1041 had added to La. Const. art. III, &sect; 2(A)(2)'s tax measure prohibitions the phrase, &quot;by the state or by any statewide political subdivision whose boundaries are coterminous with the state,&quot; but unintentionally failed to include that phrase in a new prohibition as to tax exclusions. The mistake was proven by the legislative history. Therefore &sect; 2(A)(2) permitted enactment of local tax exemptions. Defendant State had met its heavy burden of showing the omission contrary to legislative intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed and plaintiff's action was dismissed. Defendant was able to show that an amendment to the state constitution that prohibited tax exclusions had unintentionally not been limited to statewide political subdivisions, as were other tax law prohibitions; thus local sales and use tax exclusions were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certiorari review was granted for defendants, insurance company and supervisor, of the Court of Appeal Second Circuit, Parish of Caddo's (Louisiana) affirmation of a trial court award to plaintiff agent of $ 850,000 for emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life, and $ 15,000 for loss of consortium, in plaintiff's suit for La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315 intentional infliction of emotional distress after his employment was terminated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff agent was told that his production was not adequate and was put on review. Plaintiff did not meet goals set in three tiers of review, even though one review had been extended to compensate for defendant insurance company's manager's error. Though the manger recommended retention, plaintiff was terminated. Plaintiff learned of the manager's testimony, in another former agent's tort case, that defendant supervisor singled plaintiff out for termination. Plaintiff sued for La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315 intentional infliction of emotional distress and won large damages, which the appeal court reduced. Both sides sought certiorari which the court granted defendants, reversing the appeal court's affirmation of emotional distress and consortium damages, and dismissing. The trial court's jury instruction omitted reference to the requirement that defendants' conduct be outrageous and that plaintiff's distress be severe. Though defendant supervisor singled plaintiff out for review and was demeaning, plaintiff was only average, made work mistakes, the production standards were legitimate work goals, and defendant's conduct was not &quot;outrageous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Lower courts' judgments were reversed and plaintiff's claims were dismissed with prejudice. Trial court's intentional infliction of emotional distress jury instruction failed to refer to outrageous conduct, and thus the court reviewed de novo, and found that defendant supervisor's demeaning of plaintiff, who was a low-producer, did not rise to &quot;outrageous.&quot; Defendant company's loss of two of plaintiff's client applications was not deliberate.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for plaintiff and against defendant, finding defendant 100% at fault. The appellate court affirmed and, on further review, the court affirmed the appellate court. The court held that pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc.

The record supported the conclusion that plaintiff had proven all elements. Pertaining to defendant's allegation that the trial court erred in failing to assign a percentage of fault to plaintiff, the court concluded that the trial court was not clearly wrong in finding that plaintiff had not acted negligently.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:80, finding La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:80(B)&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:80(B), which provided that lack of knowledge of the juvenile's age was not a defense to the crime of carnal knowledge of a juvenile, created an impermissible presumption that defendant knew the victim's age. The trial court declared &sect; 14:80(B)&nbsp;unconstitutional and quashed the bill of information against defendant. On appeal, the court reversed. In the interest of protecting juveniles, the legislature was entitled to dispense with the knowledge requirement as to the age of the juvenile in certain crimes. Although child pornography statutes could not validly dispense with a scienter element as to the victim's age, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:80 did not criminalize conduct protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. Because there was no scienter requirement at all in &sect; 14:80, there was no conflict between La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:80(A) and (B) and no presumption of knowledge of the victim's age was created by &sect; 14:80(B).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed judgments by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal (Louisiana), which reversed defendant's conviction, finding La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:89(A)(1) was unconstitutional on its face as an infringement upon the right to privacy expressly guaranteed by the Louisiana Constitution to the extent it criminalized the performance of private, consensual, non-commercial acts of sexual intimacy between individuals legally capable of consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accuser notified police that defendant had sexually assaulted her by performing vaginal and anal intercourse. Defendant claimed that he had received oral sex, which was consensual. Defendant was charged with an aggravated crime against nature, and with simple rape. He was convicted of the crime against nature. The appellate court reversed, finding that the statute was unconstitutional as it violated the right to privacy under the state constitution by criminalizing private, consensual, non-commercial sexual acts. The supreme court reversed and reinstated the conviction, finding that, under the state constitution, there was no constitutional right to engage in consensual sexual acts of oral and anal intercourse. Because of the longstanding prohibition against oral and anal sex, the judicial discovery of a constitutional right to engage in oral and anal sex, not withstanding the legislative ban, would be based upon a serious misinterpretation of the state constitution and was completely contrary to the constitutional principle of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversing defendant's conviction was vacated in its entirety, and the conviction and sentence ordered by the trial court was reinstated. There was no right to engage in consensual oral or anal sex guaranteed by the state constitution's right to privacy.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal rendered an opinion declaring the statute unconstitutional, because it allowed the commissioner to exercise judicial power restricted by the Louisiana Constitution to elected judges. The court granted certiorari, and found the court erred in reaching the issue of constitutionality, without it having been raised by the parties. It was not disputed that the commissioner acted within the scope of the authority granted him by a state statute, which was to be presumed constitutional. Accordingly, the commissioner was presumed to have jurisdiction over the matter, until the constitutionality of the statute was challenged in a procedurally proper manner.</SPAN></P>

Appellee raised a constitutional challenge on equal protection grounds. The district court held the statute unconstitutional, finding that a person such as appellee, who filed suit after the effective date of amendments to the statute, but prior to the effective date of the latest amendments, was treated differently than a person who filed suit after the effective date of the latest amendments, because the former did not have an opportunity to make a showing of good cause for late service.

Based on the expert testimony from its previous decision, the appellate court concluded that the governmental purpose of providing highway safety bore a close correlation with the dual activities of section 14:98.1, i.e., underaged drinking and driving. In referring to the national alcohol-related fatal crash statistics, the expert did not improperly rely on the statistical procedure of imputation to correlate fatal accidents and blood alcohol content because the procedure was well-accepted and statistically sound. Thus, plaintiff State met its burden of establishing that lowering the blood alcohol content for drivers under 21 was substantially related to improving overall highway safety by reducing alcohol-related incidents. Providing a criminal penalty was not a constitutional violation because even though the violation stayed on defendant's record, the violation could not be used to enhance subsequent driving while intoxicated convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant filed an appeal from a judgment of the 22nd Judicial District Court, for the Parish of St. Tammany (Louisiana), after he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of first-degree murder, appealed. The court affirmed. The trial court's admonishment instructing prospective jurors to avoid news coverage substantially reduced the possibility that publicity tainted the jury pool. Probable cause to arrest appellant existed because time-lapse ATM surveillance videotape showed him standing next to the victim while she withdrew money, thus, appellant's statements were not fruit of an unconstitutional arrest. No abuse of discretion existed when the trial court accepted appellee State's race-neutral reasons for peremptory challenges. Testimony merely humanizing the victim was properly admitted during the guilt phase. Since the jury was not required to weigh mitigating against aggravating factors, failure of one aggravating circumstance did not invalidate appellant's death sentence when another aggravating circumstance had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant failed to overcome the strong presumption that counsel's actions were sound trial strategy, thus, claims of ineffective counsel were meritless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. DNA evidence was only admitted after the trial court fount it would assist the jury, was founded on generally accepted principles, and was reliable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner cleaners employed plaintiff for four months. Afterwards, plaintiff was diagnosed with myelodysplasia, a condition that plaintiff alleged was caused from exposure to toxic chemicals.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64A as the evidence negated any reasonable probability of misidentification because, although the victim signed an affidavit retracting his initial identification of the robbers, he testified that co-defendant's girlfriend paid him $500 to sign it, that the affidavit was not true, and that he had planned to tear it up and get a free $500; at trial, the victim identified defendant as the bald man who pointed a gun at his face, and co-defendant as the lighter-skinned robber who held a gun to the back of his head; the victim was 100% sure that defendant and co-defendant were the two men who robbed him; and he attributed his description of the truck as being black and gold, rather than maroon and gold, to the fact that it was dark at the time of the robbery.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 894.1 factors, specifically noting the seriousness of the offense and the unlikelihood of rehabilitation; the penalty was not so grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime as to shock the sense of justice; defendant failed to take responsibility for his actions as he persisted in his claims that the sex was consensual; the 55 year sentence was in the middle of the statutory range under the habitual offender statute in La.

Ann. art. 881.2(A)(2); [2]-The record did not show that defendant sought to preserve his right to have the denial of his motion for a suspended sentence reviewed on appeal as a condition of his guilty plea; [3]-Even if the issue was considered, defendant's argument that his two-year mandatory minimum sentence for failing to renew his sex offender registration violated La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 lacked merit; [4]-The trial court found that, despite the medical evidence of the condition of defendant's wife, the mandatory minimum sentence was still not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 841 was not warranted because the language in the instruction did not actually add an additional element to the definition of the obstruction of justice, and if it did, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ISSUE: Whether a parish district attorney's office was properly ordered to disclose documents and information and to pay attorney's fees and costs to a private investigator who requested documents pertaining to an inmate's case when the inmate sought to discover potentially exculpatory evidence to pursue post-conviction relief. HOLDINGS: [1]-The inmate, who petitioned for a writ of mandamus under the Louisiana Public Records Act, did not belong to the class of persons to whom La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:35 granted the cause of action asserted in the lawsuit because he did not request the public records. While the inmate contended that the private investigator requested the records on the inmate's behalf, there was no evidentiary support for this claim or any jurisprudence supporting the inmate's argument that an alleged agency relationship entitled the inmate to bring mandamus proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:175(B) was not applicable, and plaintiff's petition filed nearly a year after the annexation was untimely under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:174(A); [2]-For purposes of plaintiff's inverse condemnation claim, under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 927B, plaintiff had no right to maintain its action against the city because of the increased competition from the rezoning as plaintiff, whose sole interest for objecting to the rezoning was to prevent competition with its business, was not aggrieved and did not have standing to challenge the zoning decision in court.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34, was unconstitutionally excessive under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. HOLDINGS: [1]-The sentence imposed was not grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense and, therefore, was not unconstitutionally excessive because defendant arrived to a drug transaction armed, defendant shot at the unarmed victim while he chased him through a parking lot and onto a public street, and the victim was hospitalized and required significant rehabilitation. Moreover, the trial judge did not sentence defendant to the maximum penalty under the statute, aggravated battery was listed as a crime of violence under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:2(B)(5), and the trial judge found that defendant's lack of criminal history was a major mitigating factor.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the request by the justice of the peace for a preliminary injunction; [2]-While the issuance of the report could have led to an investigation by the Louisiana Judiciary Commission and subsequent disciplinary action by the Supreme Court of Louisiana, the justice of the peace could not claim due process protections against the release of the report.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81 because defendant's acts of hugging and kissing the victim on her cheek, and slapping her buttocks ceased when she instructed him to stop, and there was no evidence indicating that defendant attempted to get the victim to touch him in a sexual way or that he tried to touch her breast or genitals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Because the trial court did not specify that the right to appeal would be waived by pleading guilty and because the State specified that an agreement as to the sentence was not part of the plea agreement, defendant was entitled to appellate review of his sentence related to his conviction for aggravated second degree battery; [2]-The 15-year sentence imposed for aggravated second degree battery was not unconstitutionally excessive but reflected defendant's extensive criminal history, the nature of the crime in which defendant chased the victim from a residence, with children present, and stabbed the victim as he tried to escape, the serious injuries to the victim, and the finding that a lesser sentence would depreciate the seriousness of the offense; [3]-The error in including the aggravated second degree battery conviction in the habitual offender bill was harmless.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 652 because experts testified consistently that there was no indication that defendant was unable to distinguish right from wrong, and defendant's flight from the scene indicated defendant's consciousness of guilt.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 15:574.4, which provided conditions to be satisfied before a defendant could apply for parole consideration, was constitutional; [2]-La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 878.1 satisfied the requirement that a sentencer consider relevant factors pertinent to juveniles when deciding whether to allow a juvenile homicide offender the benefit of parole eligibility; [3]-Because a forensic psychologist's report did not relate to defendant's ability to distinguish between right and wrong at the time of the offense, the report, and any testimony relating to the report, was admissible at a sentencing hearing, but not at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Defendant's sentence was illegally lenient as it did not prohibit probation or suspension as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(G), but it was deemed to have been correctly restricted under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:301.1(A), which was self-activating; [2]-Defendant was properly permitted to represent himself during trial with the assistance of co-counsel under the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI, even though no Faretta inquiry was made; [3]-Although defendant questioned the witnesses during trial, counsel retained control of the case because she actively participated in the defense from trial through the multiple offender hearing, and it was evident that defendant opted for hybrid representation; [4]-Based on the totality of the circumstances, defendant was capable of making the choice of self-representation knowingly and voluntarily.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 20 because defendant first knocked the victim unconscious and then choked her until she died; defendant then attempted to conceal his responsibility for her death by disposing of the victim's body, and the court found that defendant did not feel remorse for his actions.</SPAN></P>
