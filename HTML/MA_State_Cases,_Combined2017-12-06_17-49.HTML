Const. Decl. Rights art. 12 was properly denied because, at the time, the sex offender registry scheme had no uniquely close connection to the criminal process requiring its inclusion in the scope of constitutionally required warnings, as, while registration consequences were practically inevitable, the recognized benefit of such advice was not critical, given a lack of consequences for not giving it, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect; 178E(d), Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c)(3)(B) required no such judicial warnings, and accompanying penalties were not so severe as to constitutionally require such advice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">HOLDINGS: [1]-The Massachusetts Parole Board erred in denying an inmate parole because the retroactive application of the supermajority amendment to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect; 133A, as amended through 2012 Mass. Acts 192, &sect; 39, constituted an ex post facto violation; [2]-The inmate received the necessary four out of seven votes from the Board panel required by the version of &sect; 133A in effect at the time he committed murder in the first degree, and thus, he had to be granted parole; [3]-Because the two-thirds majority consensus did not occur, parole was denied; [4]-That was clear evidence, drawn from the rule's practical implementation by the agency charged with exercising discretion, the supermajority amendment's application rendered the inmate ineligible for early release; [5]-Thus, the retroactive application resulted in a longer period of incarceration than under the earlier rule.</SPAN></P>

Gen.

Gen. Laws. ch. 278, &sect; 18 and Mass.R.Crim.P. 12.

The presiding justice could not promulgate a standing order imposing a time limit on defendant-capped pleas when the Massachusetts Legislature had not seen fit to do so.</SPAN></P>

Code Regs. 7.104(1)(q) and 7.111(3), was not arbitrary or capricious, and was supported by substantial evidence; [2]-Moreover, although the DCF's decision imposed a substantial burden on the FPs' sincerely held religious beliefs under Mass. Const. amend. art. 46, &sect; 1, as they asserted that physical discipline was an integral aspect of their Christian faith, the burden was outweighed by the DCF's compelling interest in protecting the physical and emotional well-being of foster children under &sect; 14(7)(a).</SPAN></P>

Gen.

Defendant's refusal to heed the lights and sirens of law enforcement, resulting in a chase through a residential area, undoubtedly created the potential for a disturbing effect on the public; [2]-The officer's actions in entering defendant's garage to effectuate the arrest were lawful, and not a constitutional violation under either the Fourth Amendment or Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 14, because, at the time of the warrantless entry, he was clearly in hot pursuit of defendant and defendant was aware of that. Although the officer attempted to set an arrest in motion in a public setting multiple times, defendant did not comply with his demands and fled to his home in an attempt to frustrate the arrest.</SPAN></P>

The high court held that the foreclosure statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen.

Gen.

Gen.

Gen.

Code Regs. &sect; 1.02(7)(c) in favor of the Division was proper because landowners challenging a priority habitat designation presented only conclusory allegations that a sighting of an eastern box turtle might have been inaccurate, whereas the Division presented evidence of turtle activity in and around the property and written testimony from a turtle conservation biologist.</SPAN></P>

In executing the warrant, officers observed what they believed to be cocaine, marijuana, and other items consistent with drug distribution. A second warrant was obtained and the drug evidence seized provided the basis for the charges against defendant. Defendant argued that the affidavit submitted in support of the first search warrant application was based on information obtained by the police trespassing into the curtilage of the residence, in violation of his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XIV. However, because defendant was in a third party's home rather than his own, he had the right under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14 to require that the police have a reasonable basis to believe he would be present when they entered the home in search of him, but no more. He could not challenge the first search warrant itself.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants, charged with Medicaid fraud, sought a protective order as to e-mails obtained via a search warrant. The superior court allowed the Commonwealth to search the e-mails by use of a &quot;taint team&quot; of assistant attorneys general not involved in the investigation or prosecution. Defendants appealed; a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County, Massachusetts, stayed the order and reported two questions to the full court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Commonwealth obtained warrants to search defendants' e-mail accounts. They claimed some e-mails were protected by the attorney-client privilege. The single justice certified these questions: 1) whether the Commonwealth could use an ex parte search warrant to search defendants' post-indictment e-mails; and 2) if so, whether the taint team procedure was constitutional. The high court held that a postindictment issuance of an ex parte search warrant to obtain e-mails, instead of a subpoena issued under Mass.R.Crim.P. 17, was an acceptable means to seize e-mails of a defendant under indictment. However, due to the risk of disclosure of privileged attorney-client communications, the affidavit in support of the warrant application had to inform the superior court of the nature and scope of the indictment and any relationship between the indictment and the warrant, and explain the need for a search warrant instead of a subpoena. The taint team procedures did not violate defendants' right to counsel, as the team members were not involved in the investigation or prosecution, and defendants could review the team's work and contest its privilege determinations before the superior court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The high court answered both of the reported questions in the affirmative, approved the trial court's order, and remanded the matter to the single justice for further proceedings consistent with the high court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">When he was 14, plaintiff was adjudicated a delinquent child with respect to charges of possession of a firearm without a license, and one count of unlawful possession of ammunition. At the time of his adjudication, these crimes were felonies. The trial court agreed with defendant that plaintiff was disqualified from possessing a license to carry a firearm under ch. 140, &sect; 131(d)(i), due to those adjudications. Plaintiff sought certiorari review; intervernor, the Massachusetts Attorney General, was allowed to intervene on behalf of the Commonwealth to defend the constitutionality of &sect; 131. The high court held that &sect; 131(d)(i), which barred those who had been adjudicated delinquent for the commission of a felony from obtaining a licence to carry firearms, was constitutional because it was encompassed within the &quot;presumptively lawful regulatory measures&quot; that District of Columbia v. Heller declared to be outside the ambit of the Second Amendment. As &sect; 131 was a regulatory statute, and its prohibition on the issuance of a license was not a criminal penalty, U.S. Const. amend. VIII's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment was not applicable to plaintiff's circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The  tenant received notice from the authority's voucher program representative that her voucher was being terminated because she failed to report to the authority that her mother had begun to live with her.

Complaints received and sworn to in the Springfield Division of the District Court Department on November 18, 2008. A motion to dismiss was heard by Jacques C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss a complaint charging him with violating Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 131L(a); the Springfield Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts) reported two questions as to whether the holdings in Heller and McDonald rendered &sect; 131L(a) constitutionally unenforceable and whether Massachusetts had authority to regulate for the protection of its citizens to the extent that &sect; 131L(a) could be enforced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant owned a handgun that he kept loaded and unlocked in a bedroom side table drawer on the second floor of his home. However, during an argument with his roommate, she retrieved the gun from the unlocked drawer, and threw it into the bushes beside a neighboring house. Defendant told the police, who were responding to a domestic disturbance call, that the firearm was loaded when the roommate took it. The Supreme Judicial Court found, inter alia, that unlike the provision declared unconstitutional in Heller, &sect; 131L(a) was consistent with the right of self-defense in the home because it did not interfere with the ability of a licensed gun owner to carry or keep a loaded firearm under his immediate control for self-defense. In addition, it was designed to prevent those who were not licensed to possess or carry firearms from gaining access to firearms. Consequently, it fell outside the scope of the Second Amendment. Therefore, &sect; 131L(a) was constitutional under the Supreme Court's holdings and analysis in Heller and McDonald, and Massachusetts could enforce it to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The first reported question was answered in the negative, and the second question in the affirmative; the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Complaint received and sworn to in the Salem Division of the District Court Department on April 26, 2010. The case was tried before Matthew J. Nestor, J. The Supreme Judicial Court on its own initiative transferred the case from the Appeals Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Salem Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts) that convicted him of improperly carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle and unlawfully storing a firearm in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect;&sect; 131C(a) and 131L(a); defendant claimed, among other things that &sect; 131L(a) was unconstitutionally vague, that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">When defendant, who was a correctional officer, arrived at work, he was informed that there were no lockers available to store his gun. Therefore, he returned to his vehicle, removed the firearm and holster from his person, placed them in the glove box, and locked the vehicle. On returning to the facility, the defendant was confronted by internal affairs officers, who asked to search his vehicle. Defendant informed the officers that his gun was in the vehicle and that it was not outfitted with a cable locking device. The Supreme Judicial Court found, inter alia, that &sect; 131L(a) was neither impermissibly vague nor violative of defendant's right to self-defense under the Second Amendment as it only imposed storage restrictions where a firearm was not within the owner's possession or control. However, as the evidence was conflicting on whether the glove compartment was locked or unlocked after defendant placed his weapon in it, it was insufficient to support the &sect; 131C(a) conviction. In addition, the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the meaning of &quot;locked container&quot; as to the &sect; 131L(a) charge. Therefore, defendant was entitled to a new trial on both charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was reversed, a verdict was directed in defendant's favor on the &sect; 131C(a) charge, and the case was remanded for retrial on the &sect; 131L(a) charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After an adjudicatory hearing, the Massachusetts Board of Registration of Funeral Directors and Embalmers permanently revoked petitioner embalmer's licenses to do business as a funeral director and embalmer. He appealed; a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts for the County of Suffolk reserved and reported the case without decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner was disciplined over his comments to a reporter that were published in a newspaper. The Board found that he had violated 239 Mass. Code Regs. &sect; 3.13(7) (1998), barring embalmers from commenting on the condition of dead human bodies entrusted to their care, and that he had used unprofessional language in describing dead bodies, thereby engaging in gross misconduct and unprofessional conduct that undermined the integrity of the profession. The high court held that 239 Mass. Code Regs. &sect; 3.13(7), prohibiting &quot;unprofessional&quot; or &quot;undignified and salacious&quot; comments, was overbroad, and therefore unconstitutional, because it restricted a substantial amount of protected speech. The Board's generalized interest in maintaining the integrity of the profession could not outweigh the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, rights of embalmers and funeral directors when acting outside of their professional capacity; and, even if the Board's interest could outweigh those First Amendment rights, &sect; 3.13(7) was not sufficiently narrow to achieve that end. In proscribing all &quot;undignified&quot; comments, the Board unacceptably banned a substantial amount of protected speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The case was remanded to the county court to enter an order allowing the petition and vacating the Board's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The disciplinary proceedings against the attorneys arose from two separate matters before the Department where their claims for costs and fees were rejected as precluded by 452 Mass.

The reviewing board upheld all aspects of the judge's decision and referred the matter to the senior judge for disciplinary proceedings under &sect; 7C, to temporarily suspend the right of the attorneys to practice or appear before the Department. The Supreme Judicial Court found, inter alia, that the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights did not afford the executive branch of government the power to impose professional discipline on attorneys. For that reason, insofar as &sect; 7C authorized the senior judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents to suspend the attorneys from appearing before the Department, it was invalid as a violation of Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 30. Nevertheless, because &sect; 1.19(3) achieved the Legislature's purpose to encourage attorneys to resolve their fee claims, it reflected a permissible and valid interpretation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &sect; 13A.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff domestic partner sought child custody in the Essex Division of the Probate and Family Court Department (Massachusetts). The trial court (1) dissolved the parties' registered same-sex domestic partnership (RDP), (2) held they were two children's parents, (3) granted them a child's joint legal custody, while granting the partner physical custody, (4) set visitation, and (5) ordered the spouse to pay attorney's fees. The spouse appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The spouse said it was error to find the RDP equal to a Commonwealth marriage. The supreme judicial court disagreed because (1) RDP partners' rights were identical to marriage, under Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 297.5(a) (Supp. 2012), and (2) not recognizing the RDP would let the spouse avoid her duties. It was no error to find both parties were their children's legal parents because (1) Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, &sect; 6 presumed children born in a legal spousal relationship were both spouses' children, and (2) Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 46, &sect; 4B considered a child born of artificial insemination with spousal consent to be the consenting spouse's child. It was not error to grant the partner custody of the spouse's biological child because (1) the child had a strong bond with the partner, (2) the spouse wrongfully removed the child, disrupting the bond and harming the child, (3) the partner supported the child's bond with the spouse, and (4) only the partner fostered the child's bond with the partner's biological child. It was no error to award the partner counsel fees because (1) her counsel was highly competent, (2) the spouse's conduct increased fees, and (3) the award considered each party's finances.</SPAN></P>

The supreme judicial court disagreed, finding that the trial judge appropriately instructed the jury on consent, adhering to precedent establishing that the right to consent to violent conduct related to sexual activity is outweighed by the Commonwealth's interest in preventing violence by the use of dangerous weapons upon its citizens. Defendant also claimed that the trail judge abused his discretion by allowing the Commonwealth to introduce into evidence eight photographs and a 90-second video depicting women in various states of undress being strangled. While the subject material was prejudicial, it was also highly probative of his intent and motive, as well as the victim's alleged consent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants appealed their convictions for possession of class B and class D substances with intent to distribute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Commonwealth conceded that submission in evidence of the drug certificates without the testimony of the analyst that prepared them violated defendants' right of confrontation as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that defendants' testimony about their personal drug use established their credibility for identifying the substances in their possession as cocaine and marijuana. That, in combination with the circumstantial evidence, sufficed to render the admission of the drug certificates harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Where an affidavit provided information supplied by two confidential informants whose credibility was bolstered by police knowledge of each defendant's identity and residence, and was adequately demonstrated in the affidavit, the factors provided sufficient reason to treat the informant's information as reliable; thus, the magistrate had a substantial basis for finding probable cause to believe that a search of defendants' residence would uncover evidence of illegal drug distribution pursuant to Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 14.</SPAN></P>

The supreme judicial court held applying the 2009 amendment to the trust violated substantive due process because (1) it significantly harmed the child's substantial interest in the trust, as she would have to share her interest with her adopted brothers, (2) the trust's settlor was entitled to rely on the law in effect when the trust was created, and (3) retroactive application was unreasonable, as it weakly served an underlying public interest, the child's interest vested before the amendment's effective date, including her adopted siblings as beneficiaries significantly reduced her vested interests, the amendment impacted rights of the deceased settlor, who could not change her estate plan in response, it was infinite in duration, and it was not narrowly tailored to meet its goal of equalizing adopted descendants' inheritance rights.</SPAN></P>

The residents argued that tolls collected from the Boston extension (Big Dig) and through the tolled tunnels were unconstitutional to the extent they were spent on the non-tolled portions of the MHS.

The judge who indicated that the agreed with the Commonwealth that CPSL was mandatory under &sect; 178H(a)(3) was the same judge who accepted defendant's plea and imposed defendant's sentence. The judge could not have attempted to exercise discretion he did not think he had.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court found the evidence insufficient to convict defendant on the theory that she was wanton or reckless in her acts of commission (i.e., exerting force to bring about the birth), because the Commonwealth failed to prove that, once she decided to give birth unassisted, she had any alternative safe course of action. Additionally, in light of findings that the Commonwealth had not proved that the baby was born alive, or that summoning medical assistance would have saved the baby's life, there was insufficient evidence that defendant's act of omission (i.e., failure to call for assistance) was the legal or proximate cause of the baby's death. The supreme court declined to recognize a duty of a woman, in these circumstances, to summon medical assistance, breach of which could give rise to criminal liability for involuntary manslaughter. Existing criminal laws proscribing murder, most late-term abortions, and the neglect and abuse of children appropriately protected the State's interests in safeguarding viable fetuses and living children without the need to subject all women undergoing unassisted childbirth to possible criminal liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A jury in the Central Division of the Boston Municipal Court Department (Massachusetts) convicted defendants of, inter alia, carrying a firearm without a license, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 269, &sect; 10(a); possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 269, &sect; 10(h); and possession of a loaded firearm, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 269, &sect; 10(n). Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants contended that the evidence was insufficient to establish that they were in knowing possession of a loaded revolver that was found on a walkway or that the revolver met the definition of a firearm under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 140, &sect; 121. The supreme judicial court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding that the defendants jointly and knowingly possessed the loaded revolver, as a jury reasonably could have inferred from the location of the firearm in the middle of the walkway that it had only recently landed there and, from the broken pieces, that it hit the ground with force consistent with being thrown from a moving vehicle. Defendants also claimed that the motion judge erred in denying their joint motion to dismiss the counts alleging carrying a firearm without a license and possession of a loaded firearm, as their expert determined that it was manufactured &quot;before 1899,&quot; and therefore was an &quot;antique&quot; that was not a &quot;firearm&quot; as defined in &sect; 121. Retrial on that issue was required, to allow defendants to present evidence, not that the gun was not a firearm, but that it was an antique, not subject to the license requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgments of conviction on the firearm charges and the ammunition charge were reversed and the cases were remanded for a new trial on those charges.</SPAN></P>

The police apprehended defendant later that afternoon and retrieved a firearm from a bag in the trunk of a vehicle. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the firearm because the search of the vehicle was justified by the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. There was probable cause for the arresting officers to believe that the vehicle contained an illegally possessed firearm because three individuals had warned the police that defendant was likely armed. Furthermore, sufficient evidence supported defendant?s possession conviction because the evidence warranted an inference that defendant knew that the bag contained a firearm, exercised dominion and control over the bag when he carried it outside, and continued to maintain the ability to control the bag even after it was placed into the vehicle's trunk. Finally, the trial judge did not err in allowing witnesses and the victim to use a photograph of the victim's bloodied face to illustrate and corroborate their testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After a jury-waived trial, defendant was convicted of failing to verify his sex offender registration information by refusing to provide certain secondary addresses, and was sentenced to lifetime parole, in violation of Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that the trial judge erred in denying his motions for a required finding of not guilty because there was insufficient evidence to convict him. The supreme judicial court agreed, concluding that defendant's statements that he stayed &quot;elsewhere&quot; and the false telephone numbers given to a detective were not sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he failed to register a secondary address within the specific requirements of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 6 &sect; 178H(a). The telephone numbers were not evidence of how often defendant stayed elsewhere and the Commonwealth conducted no investigation as to how often defendant stayed &quot;elsewhere.&quot; Defendant also argued that the complaint was deficient under Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 12, because it failed to allege that he was a level two sex offender, and that he had been convicted of one of the requisite offenses that could result in community parole supervision for life (CPSL). While the language of the complaint tracked the statutory provision, it did not specifically allege that defendant was a level two sex offender or identify the like offenses committed in another state that could have resulted in CPSL.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 93A, &sect; 9, and ch. 176D, &sect; 3(9)(f), for failing to effect a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement. The trial court held that primary insurer was not liable, but the excess insurer was liable for postverdict unfair settlement practices. The Appeals Court (Massachusetts) awarded loss of use damages for both preverdict and postverdict violations. The family appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The injured family member was rendered a paraplegic when a tractor trailer hit the back end of her car. The family secured a judgment against the truck driver, his employer, and the company to which the driver was assigned by his employer. The family had made settlement demands on the primary and excess insurers of the company to which the driver was assigned before the tort trial, but no settlement was forthcoming. A settlement was reached over eight months after the verdict and while the defendants' appeals were pending. While the primary insurer did not violate chs. 93A and 176D, the excess insurer's claims administrator engaged in wilful and knowing statutory violations. The damages the family was entitled to recover under ch. 93A, &sect; 9, on account of the excess insurers' postjudgment violation of ch. 93A, &sect; 2 and ch. 176D, &sect; 3(9)(f), had to be based on the underlying judgment in the tort action, and not the loss of use of the sum ultimately included in the excess insurer's late-tendered settlement offer months after the jury's verdicts. Accordingly, a determination of whether the excess insurer's preverdict statutory violations caused injury was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the judgment in the primary insurer's favor. It upheld the finding of liability against the excess insurer, but remanded the matter to the trial court for a redetermination of damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After a hearing, the District Court (Massachusetts) issued a harassment prevention order under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258E that directed defendant acquaintance not to abuse or harass plaintiff police officer. The acquaintance filed a petition to vacate and dismiss the order under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, &sect; 3, before a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, who reserved and reported the case for decision by the full court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The acquaintance argued that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258E, &sect; 1 was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face because it regulated protected speech, and unconstitutional as applied to him because the conduct complained of was protected speech. The court concluded that ch. 258E was not unconstitutionally overbroad under its interpretation of the statute. The Legislature inserted the requirements that a defendant intend to cause fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property, and that the pattern of harassment actually cause fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property. Those requirements adequately ensure that protected speech will not be found to be civil harassment in violation of c. 258E. Because the trial judge did not make any factual findings, orally or in writing, the court could not know whether the judge made this finding as to each of the three alleged acts of harassment, and the evidence was not so strong as to permit the court to infer such a finding, especially with respect to the first act committed outside the bar.The court would generally remand the case to the judge for further factual findings, but such a remand made no sense as the case was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Because the case is moot as a consequence of the expiration of the harassment prevention order and because further findings from the judge would be needed to affirm the finding of civil harassment, the case was remanded to the county court. The single justice was directed to vacate the order of harassment.</SPAN></P>

Consequently, the public school funding obligations imposed on the member municipalities by the Act superseded the funding provisions of the regional agreement.

The Department did not act without &quot;reasoned consistency&quot; because it could treat petitions using different solicitation methods differently.

Benefits exceeded cost because the generation company's size, capacity factor, location, and stage of development exceeded other resources' benefits.

The supreme judicial court disagreed, finding sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that defendant's attack of the victim was brutal and disproportionate to what was needed to bring about death, as defendant stabbed an unarmed man seven time with significant force and in such a way as to cause him pain. The supreme judicial court also found no error in the jury instructions concluding that the evidence failed to raise a reasonable doubt that what happened arose from sudden combat and thus, when the judge provided a supplemental instruction on heat of passion induced by sudden combat that failed to include the burden of proof, defendant was not prejudiced. Defendant was not entitled to an instruction on self-defense, because there was no evidence that raised a reasonable doubt as to whether defendant, who instigated the confrontation, could have avoided physical combat. The supreme judicial court also found no error in the exclusion of evidence of the victim's prior violence conduct, as the evidence did not raise an issue of self-defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After the Suffolk Superior Court (Massachusetts) denied defendant's motion to suppress a loaded firearm seized from his vehicle, a jury found him guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, unlawful possession of a loaded firearm (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(a), (h), and (n), respectively), resisting arrest, and operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that a warrantless search of his vehicle was unlawful and that contraband seized from his vehicle should have been suppressed. The high court disagreed. As officers had probable cause to believe he had been driving while under the influence and saw a half-empty bottle of cognac in plain view in his vehicle, they had probable cause to search the vehicle under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. Their warrantless seizure of a firearm that was in plain view once they lawfully entered the vehicle was also proper. Defendant's conviction of unlawful possession of ammunition was duplicative of his conviction of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, and thus violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V because it punished him twice for possession of the same ammunition. His firearm convictions did not violate his right to bear arms under U.S. Const. amend. II because the requirement of licensing before one could possess a firearm or ammunition did not by itself render the licensing statute, ch. 269, &sect; 10, unconstitutional on its face. He could not raise an as-applied challenge to the statute, as he had not attempted to obtain a license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's conviction and sentence on the lesser included offense of unlawful possession of ammunition was vacated; all of the remaining judgments of conviction were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The Essex Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) allowed defenadnts' motion and entered a judgment dismissing the teacher's complaint and affirming the arbitrator's award.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The teacher argued that Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 71, &sect; 42, which compels arbitration of a wrongful dismissal claim made by a public school teacher with professional teacher status, violates Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 30, because it impermissibly delegates to a private individual (an arbitrator) a judicial function and denies meaningful judicial review. The supreme judicial court concluded that the scope of judicial review set forth in the statute, albeit a limited judicial review, did provide for meaningful judicial review such that there was no art. 30 violation. The teacher also contended that, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 150C, &sect; 11, the arbitration award should be vacated because the arbitrator acted in excess of her authority, engaged in misconduct, and exhibited bias. The supreme judicial court disagreed, finding that the arbitrator's decision showed that she applied the correct statutory standard and properly considered, as required by statute, whether the superintendant followed the procedures called for in Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 71, &sect; 42, para. 2. The arbitrator's decision not to recuse herself was not error, as there was no evidence of partiality or bias.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The case was before the court pursuant to a remand by the United States Supreme Court granting defendant's petition for certiorari, vacating the judgment. In the previous decision the court did not address defendant's argument that his prosecution for possession of a firearm and ammunition without a firearm identification card (FID card), in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(h)(1), violated his right to keep and bear arms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The only issue the court had to decide on remand was whether the court had to dismiss the three indictments charging defendant with possession of a firearm and ammunition without an FID card. Defendant argued that the requirement of &quot;prior approval by a government officer&quot; before one may possess ammunition (or a firearm) violated the Second Amendment. Defendant did not contend that he ever attempted to obtain an FID card and therefore did not demonstrate a denial of the issuance of an FID card would have been rendered. Had he been denied an FID card, his recourse was set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 129B(5). Defendant contended that his facial challenge to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(h)(1) obviated the requirement that he had applied for and had been denied a FID card. The court did not address defendant's claims that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 7 created an unconstitutional presumption, the application of which violated his Federal due process rights as defendant did not raise those arguments at trial or in his original brief on direct appeal.

The Supreme Judicial Court found, inter alia, that the Legislature specified in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect; 178L(1) only that the classification hearing was waived where a sex offender did not timely request a hearing. Therefore, since the offender requested the hearing and his attorney was at the hearing, the Board lacked the authority to declare the hearing waived pursuant to &sect; 1.13(2).

Gen. Laws ch. 231A, &sect; 1, and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &sect; 1, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The Supreme Judicial Court found, inter alia, that the offender's classification hearings did not adequately address the heightened liberty and property interests implicated by &sect; 178K(2)(e). Because the statute does not provide for, or permit, an individualized determination that the public safety benefits of requiring the offender to leave the rest home where he lived outweighed the risks to the offender of such a removal, the statute violated the offender's right to due process of law under U.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The offenders claimed the fees and the designation of a superior court as the forum for judicial review was so cost prohibitive that it effectively denied their access to the courts and violated Mass.

It involved a right, i.e., free access to the courts, that was not fundamental. It was rationally related to achieving its purpose. The statutory scheme afforded the opportunity for judicial review and provided relief for indigent litigants. There was no separation of powers violation as the determination of the fee amount belonged to the legislature and not the courts. Consequently, the offenders failed to establish that &sect; 20A1/2 was discordant with the Massachusetts Constitution. Therefore, the city was entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff aliens filed a class action against the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority and others, alleging that exclusion from the Commonwealth Care Health Insurance Program pursuant to 2009 Mass. Acts 65, &sect; 31(a), violated their rights under the Massachusetts Constitution. The case was before the supreme judicial court on four questions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The aliens, Massachusetts residents who either were terminated from the Program or denied eligibility as a result of their alienage, alleged that exclusion from the Program pursuant to an appropriation, 2009 Mass. Acts 65, &sect; 31(a), violated their state constitutional rights. The subject statute eliminated the aliens' eligibility for the Program by adopting the same eligibility standards applicable to federally funded public benefit programs. In response to the questions before it, the supreme judicial court determined that the protection against discrimination on the basis of &quot;national origin,&quot; as enumerated in Mass. Const. art. 1, as amended by Mass. Const. amend. art. 106, did not include protection on the basis of alienage. The court noted that &quot;national origin&quot; and &quot;alienage&quot; were distinct categories separate from citizenship. The supreme judicial court further concluded that a state classification based on alienage should not be subjected to a &quot;rational basis&quot; standard of review under the Massachusetts Constitution to determine whether there was a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment between citizens and aliens and some legitimate governmental purpose.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(h)(1)); carrying a loaded firearm without a license; carrying a firearm without a license (&sect; 10(a)); and resisting arrest. He appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">When defendant saw police, he made hand movements an officer interpreted as grasping a gun. He followed defendant, who pulled a revolver. The officer pointed his gun at defendant and said, &quot;Drop it!&quot; Defendant ran away and was subdued after a struggle. Another officer secured the loaded gun, which defendant had dropped. The high court held that defendant was not &quot;seized&quot; until the officer pointed his gun at him and said, &quot;Drop it,&quot; at which time he had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was illegally carrying a firearm; thus, it was not error to deny the motion to suppress. The evidence was sufficient to convict him of all charges. When the officer asked him if he had a license for the gun, he denied having a gun; he argued his counsel was deficient for not moving to suppress this statement, which tended to prove consciousness of guilt. Even if counsel had filed a suppression motion that was allowed, as the other evidence had been sufficient to convict, defendant could not show prejudice. As defendant had not applied for an FID card or a license to carry a firearm, he could not challenge his firearm convictions under U.S. Const. amend. II or on equal protection grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A requestor sued the Commonwealth of Massachusetts under the public records law, and filed a motion to intervene in an enforcement action brought by the Massachusetts Attorney General (AG) against a lender, so he could obtain the same records, which the lender had released to the AG. The Suffolk Superior Court (Massachusetts) dismissed his complaint and denied his motion to intervene. He appealed both orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The lender claimed that the records it released to the AG were confidential; they were subject to a protective order entered in the enforcement action. The high court noted that the public records law was silent as to whether records subject to protective orders had to be disclosed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 66, &sect; 10; for separation of powers reasons, it would not assume that the legislature intended to impose such limitations on the judiciary. Therefore, the public records action was properly dismissed. As the public records law did not confer on members of the public the right to intervene in suits such as the AB's enforcement action, and as the requestor's interest was in the documents, not in the &quot;property or transaction&quot; that was the subject of that action, he was not entitled to intervene as of right under Mass. R. Civ. P. 24(a). However, as to his right to permissive intervention under Rule 24(b), where, as here, the applicant might be able to bring a separate action to challenge the protective order, it would promote judicial economy the trial judge who managed the discovery and issued the protective order to hear the challenge to that order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order dismissing the public records law complaint was affirmed, but the order denying the requestor's motion to intervene in the enforcement action was vacated and the matter was remanded for further consideration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner sexually dangerous person (SDP) pled guilty to various sex offenses, and was adjudicated an SDP. He appealed an adverse judgment entered in a discharge proceeding that was tried in 2002. A judgment adverse to the SDP was tried in 2005. The SDP's motion for a new trial was denied. The Massachusetts Appeals Court consolidated the appeal with the SDP's direct appeal of the 2002 judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The appellate court reversed, but did not invalidate the later adverse judgments. The state's highest court granted the SDP's application for review. The state's highest court agreed that the 2002 adverse judgment was in error as both qualified examiners opined there that the SDP no longer remained sexually dangerous. However, the SDP was found to remain an SDP in discharge proceedings tried in 2005, 2008, and 2010. The 2002 judgment was not void. The trial court had jurisdiction over the SDP and the subject matter of the case. Even if the Johnstone error raised a jurisdictional issue, the erroneous interpretation of a statutory grant of jurisdiction did not render the judgment a complete nullity. The judgment was voidable and was valid until reversed. Because the 2002 judgment had not been reversed at the time of the later discharge proceedings, it remained in effect. The SDP was legally held at the treatment center as an SDP at the time of the later adverse judgments. As the SDP had been found to remain an SDP, he was not entitled to discharge from the treatment center. His substantive due process rights were not violated as there has been no finding that he was no longer an SDP.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment of the Superior Court dated July 3, 2002, was reversed, and the jury verdict was set aside. It was found that the SDP was not entitled to an order of discharge at this time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">When the Commonwealth sought the inmate's commitment as an SDP, he was in prison for violating lifetime community parole conditions imposed pursuant to Mass.

The supreme judicial court held the inmate could seek relief under Mass. Gen.

The inmate was not a &quot;prisoner,&quot; for purposes of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 12(b), when the Commonwealth filed its petition seeking his civil commitment, even though he was in custody, because (1) Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 275, &sect; 18, pursuant to which he was incarcerated, had been found facially unconstitutional, so his sentence was not valid when the Commonwealth filed its petition, and (2) he was in custody only until he could have his unconstitutional sentence vacated, so the Commonwealth lacked the necessary custodial prerequisite to file a petition under Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After the owners modified portions of their property that were within a 200-foot buffer zone created by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 92A1/2, &sect; 5, the Department of Conservation and Recreation instituted enforcement proceedings for violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 92A1/2, &sect; 5. The parties then entered into an agreement whereby the owners removed portions of the beach and the retaining wall and replanted their property as required by the Department. Their subsequent application for a variance was denied. The Supreme Judicial Court found, inter alia, that the &quot;relevant parcel&quot; was the entire parcel. Because the Watershed Management Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 92A1/2, &sect;&sect; 1-20, included explicit exceptions as well as a variance procedure, it was not facially invalid. The owners retained the right to use their land, as a whole. The Act merely regulated the use of certain portions of the land abutting the public watershed. Therefore, because the denial of the variance only affected 8-11 per cent of the owners' property, and they continue to derive significant economic benefit from their property as a whole, there was no regulatory taking under arts. 10 or 49, and no compensation was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, company and employees, appealed a judgment by the Suffolk Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) that affirmed a finding by a hearing officer in the Securities Division of defendant Secretary of the Commonwealth that they violated the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act, Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After the Massachusetts resident went to the company's interactive website and registered for information about investment products it offered for sale, he received an e-mail from a company employee to which documents were attached that contained detailed information regarding the performance of a company's hedge funds, the returns the funds had earned, background information on the company's partners, news articles about the funds, and a description of a company's investment philosophy and strategy. The Supreme Judicial Court found, inter alia, that the e-mail constituted a solicitation of an offer to buy unregistered securities in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 110A, &sect; 401(i)(2). That violation, in turn, constituted a sufficient nexus to permit personal jurisdiction under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, &sect; 3. By contacting the resident, the company purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in Massachusetts. The Secretary's enforcement proceedings arose out of a company's contacts with Massachusetts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The local court employed a policy in certain child-related proceedings in which the court orally contacted the local department of children and families for information, which was transmitted to the judge for consideration.

Beyond the constitutional rights, the court found that it could and should review the protocols under its superintendency powers pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, &sect; 3. The current protocols did not provide litigants with adequate due process. The current protocols permitted judges in certain child-related proceedings to consider as substantive evidence a written report summarizing an oral report that summarized a written report containing hearsay information.

The Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) dismissed the action. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The case involved refunds of taxes paid pursuant to 2005 Mass. Acts 163, &sect;&sect; 57, 57A, 57B (abatement act) which was later held unconstitutional. The trial court found that the taxpayer had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The taxpayer did not claim that he requested interest in his application for abatement, or that he pursued any other administrative channels to obtain interest on the overpayment. However, he argued that this action was proper because pursuit of administrative remedies would have been futile and neither the commissioner nor the Massachusetts Appellate Tax Board (board) had the authority to declare a statute unconstitutional. The appellate court found that this view of the board was unduly constrained and inconsistent with case law. The board previously had addressed constitutional claims and ordered abatement on constitutional grounds, despite contrary statutory provisions, orders that had been upheld. In any event, the board could have declared the statute unconstitutional or &quot;illegal,&quot; pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62C, &sect; 37, as applied to the taxpayer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The state's highest court held that 803 Mass. Code Regs. 1.40(5) (2004), which permitted consideration of an expert opinion obtained for classification purposes only if the expert testified, had a rational basis, and did not violate the offender's due process and equal protection rights. The offender's failure to subpoena his treating psychologist to testify at the hearing, not Reg. 1.40(15), deprived him of the opportunity to present the psychologist's favorable opinion as to the offender's risk of reoffense. The offender's constitutional challenges to Reg. 1.40(5) failed. Sex offenders were entitled to the effective assistance of counsel at a classification hearing. While hearing counsel provided deficient performance in disclosing unfavorable evidence during discovery and at the hearing, the offender did not show prejudice from counsel's incompetence. The offender's criminal charges and convictions indicated repetitive and compulsive behavior under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect; 178K(1)(a)(ii), and a continuing course of sexual misconduct that demonstrated a high risk of reoffense. His conviction for enticing a child over the Internet doomed him to a level three classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed judgments by the Barnstable Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) that, inter alia, convicted him of illegally distributing or dispensing controlled substances in violation of Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After defendant, a registered physician, wrote prescriptions for pain-relieving opiates for seven patients, a local law enforcement officer convinced one of the patients to participate in a &quot;sting&quot; operation designed to catch defendant taking possession of the controlled substances he had prescribed to the patient. The Supreme Judicial Court found, inter alia, that the federal nature of the investigation insulated the resulting evidence not only from suppression under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 99(D)(1)(c), but also from automatic suppression under Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 14. Thus, defendant's motion to suppress was correctly denied and the evidence was properly admitted at the trial. Defendant's act of issuing an unlawful prescription was the act of unlawful distribution since his patients were not ultimate users--their possession being unlawful under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 34. Consequently, defendant was properly convicted of violating Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect;&sect; 32A(a), 32B(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Having been notified by a homeless shelter's director that the juvenile allegedly possessed a gun, police officers determined that the director had authority to consent to their entry and conducted a warrantless search of the juvenile's room.

The Supreme Judicial Court found, inter alia, that the search violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 14. Although the room was a transitional living space, it was nonetheless the juvenile's home. Accordingly, he had a privacy interest in the room under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 1. Although the shelter's manual allowed shelter staff to enter the room, it did not permit shelter staff to allow the police to enter to search for and seize contraband or evidence. Therefore, the director did not have actual or apparent authority to consent to the search by the police. Accordingly, the seized gun and the juvenile's statement should have been suppressed as &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Commonwealth appealed an order by the Lowell Division of the District Court Department that dismissed the charge against defendant of storing or keeping a firearm in an unsecured or inoperable condition, in violation of Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After defendant's 18-year old son, who appeared to have developmental disabilities, admitted to the police officers that he had fired shots at his neighbor's house, he disclosed the location of other weapons and ammunition in the home. Although one of the weapons was secured with a trigger lock, the other had no gun locking device. The trial judge dismissed the count against defendant, explaining that he was unable to distinguish the provisions of &sect; 131L, from those that were struck down by the United States Supreme Court in Heller as unconstitutionally infringing the right to bear arms. The supreme judicial court found, inter alia, that U.S. Const. amend. II did not apply to the States. In addition, &sect; 131L differed from the ordinance that was struck down in Heller because it did not require that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times. Accordingly, the trial court erred in finding that amend. II applied to the States as a matter of substantive due process and that the provisions of the two statutes were indistinguishable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After hearing a broadcast of an ambulance request to treat the victim of a shooting and a description of the alleged shooter, members of a drug task force stopped defendant. As they advanced toward him, defendant began moving away. When asked to talk to them, defendant pointed to his waist and dropped something to the ground. At that point, the officers seized defendant's hands, found the dropped item (a gun), and arrested defendant. The Supreme Judicial Court found, inter alia, that the information transmitted by the dispatcher to the officers bore sufficient indicia of reliability that they were entitled to rely on the dispatch in conducting their investigation. Because the stop was lawful, defendant's motion to suppress the handgun was properly denied. The erroneous admission of the ballistics certificate was harmless because other lawfully admitted evidence showed that the gun was a working firearm and that the ammunition was designed for use in it was overwhelming. Finally, because U.S. Const. amend. II did not apply to the States, Mass. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed the judgments from the Superior Court Department, Suffolk (Massachusetts), rendered after a jury trial, finding him guilty of murder in the first degree on the theory of felony murder with armed robbery as the predicate felony, and guilty of armed robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's convictions arose from the robbery and shooting death of a convenience store owner. An eyewitness described a van and occupants he saw parked outside of the convenience store on the morning of the robbery.

From the evidence that one-half of the proceeds of the robbery was in a jacket which by inference belonged to defendant, a finding was warranted that defendant assisted in the commission of the robbery while sharing the requisite mental state. Defendant's right to a fair trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XII was not violated even though a juror sent a postverdict letter to the trial judge suggesting his guilty vote was due to pressure from other jurors because none of the juror's complaints constituted an extraneous influence on the jury but rather concerned the jury's internal deliberations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After defendant pled guilty to attempted murder, armed home invasion, and five related crimes, the Massachusetts trial court sentenced him to five years to five years and one day on count one, a consecutive sentence of five years' probation on count two, and, on the remaining counts, five-year terms of probation to run concurrently with the probationary term imposed on count two. The Commonwealth was granted leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The home invasion statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 18C, provided for imprisonment for life or for any term of not less than 20 years. The Commonwealth argued that the sentence imposed on the armed home invasion conviction contravened &sect; 18C, which the Commonwealth contended did not permit a probationary sentence in lieu of a mandatory minimum 20-year term of incarceration. The high court held that, in light of the successive changes the legislature made to &sect; 18C, that statute was ambiguous with respect to whether it permitted a sentence of probation. The rule of lenity therefore came into play. The removal of three explicit prohibitions against probationary sentences for specific categories of offenders might indicate a legislative intent to give a sentencing judge the power, in appropriate situations, to impose a term of probation in lieu of incarceration. The high court was constrained to conclude that &sect; 18C allowed a trial judge to impose a probationary sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Commonwealth charged defendant licensee with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(1)(a)(1). A jury found the licensee not guilty. The licensee then filed a motion seeking restoration of his license, in accordance with &sect; 24(1)(f)(1). The Ayer Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts) denied the motion. The licensee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Initially, the Commonwealth argued that there was no specific authorization for the licensee's purported appeal. The appellate court disagreed. Because &sect; 24(1)(f)(1) did not provide for judicial review of adverse license restoration orders, and such orders were civil, a defendant's &quot;appeal&quot; was viewed as a civil action in the nature of certiorari under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 249, &sect; 4. The licensee did not challenge on appeal the substantive merits of the decision denying his motion for license restoration. Instead, he challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 24(1)(f)(1), contending that it violated the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers mandated by Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 30. Where the function that a statute assigned to the courts to perform was closely connected with and incidental to strictly judicial proceedings, the courts in obeying the statute were not exercising executive or legislative powers. There was nothing unconstitutional about the decisions described &sect; 24(1)(f)(1). Contrary to the licensee's argument, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 22D did not apply because his license was not suspended because of an automobile law violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order denying the licensee's motion to reinstate his license was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that his attempt conviction should be reversed because the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence of an overt act. The supreme judicial court agreed, finding the evidence insufficient to survive a motion for a required finding of not guilty. Even though the undercover officer and defendant came to an agreement, defendant had not seen a child and did not know the exact location of the child. Defendant had yet to follow the officer to any type of house or park, and he had not yet paid for the child. The preparation and negotiation, although sufficient to support a guilty verdict for solicitation, did not come near enough, in time or ability, to the substantive crime of attempted rape to sustain a guilty verdict. The supreme judicial court also concluded that Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 272, &sect; 53A was not void for vagueness, as it sufficiently informed defendant that agreeing to pay money to have sexual intercourse with a young child was prohibited. Next, the supreme judicial court concluded that the trial court's response to a jury question was proper and repeating the instruction on offer or agreement would have been beyond the scope of the question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant juveniles moved to dismiss complaints charging them with violating a curfew ordinance. The Middlesex County Division, Juvenile Court Department (Massachusetts), certified these questions: (1) Did the ordinance violate defendants' rights to equal protection under U.S. Const. XIV or Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. I? (2) What was the proper standard of review in considering an equal protection challenge to a juvenile curfew ordinance?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The ordinance required persons under 17 to be at home between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. unless they met one of a number of exceptions. The high court held that the ordinance implicated, and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. I protected, a fundamental right of free movement within the State. Therefore, the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard of review applied, and the State had the burden to demonstrate that the ordinance was narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest. The government had a compelling interest in protecting minors and in crime prevention, and the curfew itself was narrowly tailored to achieve its purposes. However, the processes and punishments provided in the ordinance for curfew violations were not the least restrictive means of accomplishing those purposes, and contradicted the goals of rehabilitating, not incarcerating, juvenile offenders. Thus, they were not sufficiently tailored to meet the strict scrutiny standard. However, the civil enforcement provisions of the ordinance were sufficiently less restrictive to survive constitutional scrutiny. As the ordinance had a severability clause, the curfew itself and the civil enforcement provisions survived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">As to the first question, the answer was &quot;Yes&quot; with regard to criminal penalties resulting from violations of the ordinance. The curfew itself and its civil enforcement mechanism remained in force. As to the second question, the proper standard of review was strict scrutiny. The cases were remanded to the juvenile court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The jury found that plaintiff and the employee were each 50 per cent negligent; it awarded plaintiff only his medical expenses. The Middlesex Superior Court (Massachusetts) ordered a new trial pursuant to Mass. R.Civ.P. 59(a) unless the employer accepted an additur. The employer did so, and then appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Finding the jury's decision to award no pain and suffering damages unreasonable, given plaintiff's severe and uncontested injuries, the trial court ordered a new trial unless the employer accepted an addition to the verdict. The high court held that henceforth, parties accepting additur or remittitur orders could not appeal from such orders once judgment entered. When a new trial on damages was granted subject to such an order, a party could accept the adjustment; reject it and proceed with a new trial on damages, after which the propriety of the order for new trial could be raised on appeal; or request the trial court to report the question of the order's propriety for interlocutory review under Mass. R.Civ.P. 64(a). Ordering a new trial unless defendant accepted an additur was proper, in light of the precise match between plaintiff's medical expenses and the award, his extensive injuries, and the limited evidence of his treatment for any unrelated condition. The trial court did not err in excluding expert testimony proffered by the employer as speculative or in instructing jurors that plaintiff would not be awarded any damages if they found him more than 50 per cent negligent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant probationer was convicted of indecent assault and battery on a child under 14 and sentenced to 25 years' probation. The Commonwealth sought relief for his violation of the terms of probation. The Bristol Superior Court (Massachusetts) modified the terms of his probationary sentence to require that, pursuant to Mass. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court ruled that &sect; 47, which required probationers to wear GPS devices, applied to sex offenders who commenced a term of probation after &sect; 47's effective date. The probationer argued that as he was originally sentenced to probation long before &sect; 47's effective date, it could not be applied to him because in the circumstances of his case, &sect; 47 operated as an unconstitutional ex post facto law. The high court held that &sect; 47 applied to sex offenders who were sentenced to probation after &sect; 47's effective date, regardless of whether the crimes were committed before or after that date. Due to the substantial burden on liberty &sect; 47 imposed as part of the sentence for certain crimes, it was punitive in effect. And as &sect; 47 operated retroactively with respect to the probationer, because the penalties for a violation of the terms of supervised release were attributed to the original conviction rather than to the violation, applying &sect; 47 to him was impermissible under the ex post facto provisions of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24.</SPAN></P>

The New Bedford Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts) granted a stay, and reported five questions of law as to the constitutionality of &sect; 47 to the appellate court under Mass.R.Crim.P. 34.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The state's highest court held that although &sect; 47 was not without ambiguity, the phrase &quot;for any offense&quot; suggested that the offense had been proved to have occurred, rather than just charged or alleged. The Commonwealth's interpretation of &quot;probationer&quot; to mean all defendants on probation, whether before trial or after conviction, led to an absurd result as it required fees from all probationers, but allowed fee waivers only for probationers who were also offenders. The phrase &quot;any person placed on probation for a sex offense&quot; in the first paragraph of &sect; 47 referred to a person who was placed on probation as part of a sentence after conviction. The legislative history of &sect; 47 supported this construction. The Massachusetts legislature intended the GPS requirement to apply only to convicted individuals. Section &sect; 47 did not have to be interpreted harmoniously with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 87, which used the blanket term &quot;probation&quot; to refer to both pretrial and postconviction probation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The first defendant and second defendant, in unrelated cases, were both charged with, inter alia, unlicensed possession of a firearm.

The supreme judicial court held that the district court properly dismissed the count of the complaint charging defendant with intimidating a judge because the complaint failed to establish probable cause to believe that he violated &sect; 13B. The legislature intended the word &quot;trial&quot; in &sect; 13B to refer only to criminal trials.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs youths moved the Suffolk County, Hampden County and Essex County Juvenile Court Departments (Massachusetts) to dismiss applications under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 120, &sect;&sect; 17 - 19 (the statute), to extend their commitments to defendant Department of Youth Services (department). When their motions were denied, they sought relief from a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, who reserved and reported three questions to the full court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The statute let the department seek to extend the youths' commitments past their eighteenth birthdays. The supreme judicial court held it violated substantive due process because it required no link between their alleged dangerousness and a mental condition keeping them from controlling their conduct. Its prior requirement that their physical dangerousness be due to a mental or physical deficiency was removed and could not be judicially restored to render the statute constitutional. Its required finding that the youths were &quot;physically dangerous&quot; was unconstitutionally vague as it did not indicate the nature and degree of dangerousness required and gave no guidance on how to make such a finding. It did not limit consideration of physical dangerousness to certain youths and required no specific degree of certainty that they were dangerous. A determination of dangerousness was left to the unbridled discretion of the department in filing a petition, and, ultimately, a judge reviewing the petition. The statutory phrase &quot;physically dangerous to the public&quot; could not be construed to mean a &quot;likelihood of serious harm&quot; because this would add language the legislature chose to omit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">It was ordered that a declaration enter in the county court that the statute did not comport with the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the matter was remanded to the county court for further proceedings as appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant juvenile was charged in the Supreme Judicial Court for the County of Suffolk (Massachusetts) with nine sexual offenses. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts appealed from an order and judgment of a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts denying the Commonwealth's petition pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, &sect; 3,  to vacate a juvenile court judge's pretrial discovery order issued pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 14(a)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The juvenile, a teenage male, engaged in sexual acts with three girls. After his counsel unsuccessfully attempted to have the girls charged with raping the juvenile, the juvenile sought discovery from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts under Mass.R.Crim.P. 14(a)(2), to investigate and, if possible, support his claim that he was being selectively prosecuted due to his gender. The Commonwealth contended that the juvenile failed to present evidence to upset the presumption of regularity in its decision to initiate proceedings, that the requested material was neither relevant nor material to the charges, and that production of the information would have been onerous and implicated the privacy of others. The court found that the record suggested that the sexual activity was non-forcible, that all of the youths mutually agreed to it, and that all were under the age of consent. Accordingly, the juvenile met the threshold showing required under Rule 14(a)(2) that the discovery he sought was relevant to his claim of selective prosecution, and the Commonwealth failed to advance any persuasive reason that it could not, or should not, have been required to meet its obligation of production.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment of the single justice, which denied the Commonwealth's petition, was affirmed. The stay pending appeal ordered by the single justice was vacated, the Commonwealth was ordered to respond to the juvenile's discovery request, the case was ordered to proceed in the juvenile court on an expedited basis with the judge ensuring that no nonemergency delays were tolerated.</SPAN></P>

Civil action commenced in the Superior Court Department on October 10, 2003.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff student sued defendant Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA), alleging due process and equal protection violations and asserting claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. The Norfolk Superior Court (Massachusetts) granted the MIAA a directed verdict on all claims except a &sect; 1983 claim, and later granted it judgment notwithstanding the verdict on that claim as well. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff contended the MIAA unfairly declared her ineligible for her high school swim team because she had belonged to a private swimming club, while others who swam in such clubs were not deemed ineligible, and that the MIAA's rules, intended to discourage persons from seeking judicial review of its decisions, were &quot;threats, intimidation or coercion&quot; that violated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &sect;&sect; 11H, 11I, of the Civil Rights Act. The high court held that she had no property interest in participating in interscholastic athletics, and thus no due process rights in the circumstances. Further, she did not show that she was treated differently from other similarly situated students, or that this alleged differential treatment resulted from a gross abuse of power or fundamental procedural unfairness on the part of the MIAA. Thus, she failed to establish an equal protection violation. She did not show that the MIAA, in promulgating its rules, interfered with her enjoyment of her civil rights by &quot;threats, intimidation or coercion,&quot; as required to prevail under ch. 12, &sect; 11I. As the MIAA failed to pay the docket fee required by Mass. RAP 10(a)(1), its cross appeal was not considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The high court affirmed the trial court's allowance of the MIAA's motions for directed verdicts and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The MIAA's cross appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant taxpayers challenged the decision of appellee, the Appellate Tax Board, which denied the taxpayers' application for an abatement of financial institution excises taxes (FIET) under Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayers were associated financial institutions incorporated in the State of Delaware and had a commercial domicile in the State of Virginia. The taxpayers neither owned nor leased any real property in Massachusetts and only solicited and conducted credit card approval activities therein. At issue in the case was whether, consistent with the federal commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, the Commonwealth could impose the FIET on financial institutions, such as the taxpayers, that did not have a physical presence in Massachusetts. The court held that the substantial nexus test articulated in case law applied to the imposition of the FIET and that, in addition to the consumer lending activities, the taxpayers were soliciting and conducting significant credit card business in Massachusetts with hundreds of thousands of Commonwealth residents, generating millions of dollars in income for themselves. The court found that such activities in Massachusetts on the part of the taxpayers, as well as their servicing of customer complaints, established a substantial nexus with the Commonwealth and, therefore, the assessment of the FIET comported with the federal commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor argued that he was concerned that the juror was likely to have sympathy for the parties based on an indication she had sympathy for one of the &quot;principals&quot; in a prior case in she was a juror, and made a passing reference to the juror's occupation. The supreme judicial court held that the prosecutor's stated reasons for the challenge, considered separately or together, did not satisfy the Commonwealth's burden of countering the prima facie finding of improper use by proffering a &quot;bona fide,&quot; race-neutral explanation for the challenge. In addressing defendant's other claims, the supreme judicial court concluded that the evidence presented did not warrant a jury instruction on self defense and that the prosecutor's argument that defendant was not credible when he stated that the victim yelled a racial insult before the incident began was founded in the evidence admitted and was a fair response to defense counsel's closing argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of reckless endangerment of a child in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 13L in Falmouth District Court (Massachusetts). He challenged the constitutionality of the statute, claiming that it was vague and overbroad as applied to his circumstances. He also contended that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction, and that his waiver of the right to a jury trial was not made knowingly and voluntarily.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant, with a three year old child in his charge, deliberately embarked on a high-speed nighttime chase, to evade and elude the police. During that chase, he reached speeds in excess of twice the speed limit and traveled over unpaved roadways that were narrow, scarred with pot holes, and contained sharp turns. The chase ended only after he drove over an embankment and several hundred yards into the woods, where he fled on foot (with the child) with the police in pursuit. This behavior created the type of substantial and unjustifiable risk of serious bodily injury to a child that any person of common intelligence would understand to be well within the boundaries of the prohibition of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 13L. Therefore, defendant's vagueness challenge failed. There was no ambiguity in the statutory language that would lead the court to limit its application in the manner defendant suggested. Neither did its application as written lead to an irrational result. The judge had made findings with respect to all of the elements and the evidence plainly was sufficient to establish guilt. Defendant's waiver of a jury trial was intelligent and voluntary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The proposed law contained in the initiative petition would eliminate parimutuel dog racing by repealing the provisions of Mass.

The certification complied with the local matters exclusion under Mass. Const. art. 48, the Initiative, pt. II, &sect; 2 because while the immediate practical effect of the proposed law would only be on two localities where dog racing was currently licensed by the State Racing Commission, the proposed law on its face would apply uniformly to all municipalities in the Commonwealth. The petition was not inconsistent under &sect;&sect; 2 and 3 with the right to receive compensation for private property appropriated to public use because the facts available to the AG at the certification stage did not permit an adequate determination of the potential residual use of plaintiffs' real and personal property or the diminution in the property's value as a result of the proposed law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, a daughter and a spouse, appealed a ruling by the Worcester Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) that allowed defendants' motion for partial summary judgment in the plaintiffs' medical malpractice action involving a same-sex couple; the defendants claimed that the spouse's claims for the loss of consortium could not be proved because the parties were not married at the time the alleged cause of action accrued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The spouse and the partner met in 1986. In 1994, they exchanged rings in a private ceremony. Through an anonymous donor program, the spouse conceived a child, who was jointly adopted by the spouse and the partner. The couple shared all household expenses, and executed legal documents, including durable powers of attorney, wills, health care proxies, and life insurance policies, each granting the other the necessary legal authority or naming the other as her beneficiary. In 2003, the partner was diagnosed with breast cancer. At that time, she and the spouse were not married. Pursuant to the Goodridge holding, however, they applied for a marriage license on the first day the Commonwealth permitted it, and were married on May 20, 2004. The Supreme Judicial Court found that even though the parties married as soon as it was legal for them to do so, because the partner's cancer was diagnosed before they were married, the spouse was not entitled to loss of consortium damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The reported questions were answered in the negative, the grant of summary judgment was affirmed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff taxpayer sought an abatement of a pro forma tax computed and assessed by defendant assessors under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59, &sect; 2C, for the portion of fiscal year 2000 that came after the property was purchased by the taxpayer on December 17, 1999. The Appellate Tax Board (Massachusetts) denied the request for an abatement. The taxpayer appealed. The case was transferred from the Appeals Court of Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer had purchased two parcels of land for a total price of $ 4,500,000. The prior owner was not subject to real estate tax on the parcels. The assessors based the tax on the property for the fiscal year in which in the sale took place on the sales price. The taxpayer argued that, by basing the tax on the purchase price, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59, &sect; 2C imposed an unconstitutional disproportionate or discriminatory tax on it. The appellate court disagreed. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59, &sect; 2C, was a proper exercise of the power of proportional taxation, ensuring that nonexempt properties did not benefit from an unintended tax exemption, and that disproportionate taxation was reduced generally. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59, &sect; 2C was a reasonable method of effectuating a valid withdrawal of property from exempt status. Because mathematical precision was not required and fair market value was sometimes equated with fair cash value, use of actual sales price to approximate the property's fair cash valuation was permissible. The taxpayer failed to carry its burden of proving that the statute was unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In a paternity action, the Plymouth Division of the Probate and Family Court Department (Massachusetts) reserved and reported the question of whether a judge of that court had authority under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, &sect; 9, to enter an initial award of child support, for the benefit of plaintiff nonmarital child, after the death of the obligor, the child's father. The report was transferred to the state's highest court on its own motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The state's highest court held that if paternity was not disputed, the Massachusetts legislature's policy mandates regarding the support and protection of nonmarital children permitted a Massachusetts Probate and Family Court judge to enter and enforce an initial award of child support for a nonmarital child after the death of the obligor. Exceptions to testamentary freedom, legislative changes increasing protection for children, explicit legislative mandates on child support, public policy concerns, and contemporary legal authority were considered. Of paramount importance was the continuing obligation of parents to support their children under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119A, &sect; 1. The conclusion comported with the important public policy furthered by the child support scheme of providing for the best interests of children. It also was consistent with the legislature's imperative to abolish discriminatory treatment toward nonmarital children under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, &sect; 1. The Social Security survivor benefits, life insurance proceeds, and any other payments or benefits the child had, or would receive, were to be taken into account by means of a credit to the father's estate.</SPAN></P>

The supreme judicial court found no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. He identified no specific injury under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 234, &sect; 28, as Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 234, &sect; 32 required. The presumption was tied to the State's burden of proof, and the judge's initial remarks stated both that burden and that defendant did not have to present evidence. The final instructions said the burden meant defendant had every presumption of being not guilty, and said he was presumed innocent throughout trial. The substantive admission of a witness's grand jury testimony as a prior inconsistent statement, after he said he did not recall it, did not violate defendant's right to confrontation because the witness was present at trial and subject to cross-examination. Counsel's failure to move to revoke the witness's immunity was not ineffective because defendant had no standing to make the request. A consciousness of guilt instruction, based in part on his arrest in another country, was not error because other, sufficient, evidence showed consciousness of guilt.</SPAN></P>

The trooper directed his flashlight inside the vehicle and saw a small glassine bag containing white powder. The trooper discovered substantially more cocaine in the trunk. Defendant sought to prove that the stop of the vehicle in which he was traveling was the product of racial profiling by establishing that the trooper had a history of disproportionately stopping and citing nonwhite motorists for motor vehicle violations. Defendant used census benchmarking and introduced the trooper's citation history. The Supreme Court held defendant failed to present credible evidence establishing a reasonable inference of impermissible discrimination sufficient to rebut the presumption that the stop was undertaken in good faith, without intent to discriminate. The use of census benchmarking to compare the demographics of a small community with citation ratios on a major interstate highway, which happened to pass through, was unreliable and not accepted in the scientific community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff retailer sought review by the Appellate Tax Board (Massachusetts) of the decision of defendant Massachusetts Commissioner of Revenue suspending the retailer's license to sell cigarettes, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 64C, &sect; 14. The Board vacated the suspension and declared 830 Mass. Code Regs. 64C.14.1 (1993) invalid. The Commissioner appealed, and the Supreme Judicial Court transferred the case from the Appeals Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Commissioner said the retailer sold cigarettes below cost, contrary to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 64C, &sect; 12 et seq. The supreme judicial court held 830 Mass. Code Regs. 64C.14.1 (1993), setting the retailer's presumptive cost to sell cigarettes, was not inconsistent with the statute by creating a rebuttable presumption that the presumptive cost was the retailer's cost to sell cigarettes. The regulation's presuspension hearing process violated due process by not allowing approval of the retailer's cigarette prices based on a good faith need to meet a competitor's prices, as allowed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 64C, &sect; 16, and by limiting the hearing to whether the retailer had approval to sell cigarettes below presumptive cost or did not sell below this cost. The retailer's property interest was not insubstantial, the chance of an erroneous deprivation was high, and the Commissioner's interest in such a limited hearing was &quot;elusive,&quot; as requiring consideration of whether the retailer had a defense under &sect; 16 was not unduly burdensome. The Appellate Tax Board could not declare the regulation invalid because it could only decide if the Commissioner properly found a willful violation of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant sent sexually explicit &quot;instant messages&quot; to officers posing as a 14-year-old girl. The supreme court held the statute required proof that defendant enticed a child, or someone he thought was a child, with the intent to commit a crime listed in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 26C(b). &quot;Entice&quot; was adequately defined and the statute gave notice of what was barred and adequate law enforcement guidelines. It did not violate the First Amendment as the statute barred sexual exploitation of children and did not bar forming constitutionally protected associations or constitutionally protected speech. The burden of proof was not shifted to defendant to show he did not think the person enticed was a child because the Commonwealth still had to prove his intent. The evidence sufficiently showed defendant enticed someone he thought was a child by inviting her to come to his home. His statements about sexual acts he wanted to perform showed an intent to commit statutory rape. His messages to the &quot;child&quot; supported the issuance of a search warrant for his home. His admissions to molesting children showed a predisposition to commit similar crimes, in response to his entrapment claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Commonwealth of Massachusetts sought review of judgments from the Appeals Court (Massachusetts), which affirmed a trial court's conviction of defendant for receiving stolen property (RSP), but reversed convictions for armed home invasion (AHI) and breaking and entering (BE) due to the admission by the trial court of 14 of defendant's prior convictions for purposes of impeachment under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant allegedly broke down the door of an acquaintance's apartment, demanded money at knifepoint, and fled in a stolen automobile. Defendant offered a vastly different version of the incident. Prior to trial, the trial court excluded a number of defendant's prior convictions for impeachment purposes due to their similarity to the charged offenses. However, it allowed the admission of 14 prior convictions. Defendant was convicted of AHI and RSP. He was thereafter convicted of BE with the intent to commit a misdemeanor and acquitted of two other offenses. On appeal, the appeals court affirmed only the RSP conviction upon finding that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the prior convictions. On further review, the court found that admission of the convictions was not an abuse of discretion under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &sect; 21, as they were not substantially similar to the charged crimes. There was no error in the jury instruction on the AHI charge under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 18C. The allowance of nonverbal responses by the victim and defense counsel's comment on defendant's failure to make a statement to the police did not create a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">When the citizen was 22 years old, he tendered an Alford plea to a charge of rape. He completed his term of probation without incident and was not convicted of any crime in the over 20 years following his discharge from probation. He asserted that his substantive and procedural due process rights under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights were violated because he was not afforded a hearing to challenge the Massachusetts Sex Offender Registry Board's classification recommendation under Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 6, &sect; 178K(2)(a) (1999 Mass. Acts ch. 74, &sect; 2, as amended through 2003 Mass. Acts ch. 77), and there was no evidence to suggest that he posed a danger so as to necessitate registration. On appeal, the court found that the retroactive imposition of the registration requirement without an opportunity to overcome the conclusive presumption of dangerousness that flowed from the conviction, violated the citizen's right to due process under the Massachusetts Constitution. Thus, he was to be granted the hearing which he requested, where he was to have the opportunity to demonstrate that he neither posed a risk of re-offense nor was a current danger to vulnerable members of communities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of rape and he was classified as a level three sex offender.

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss or alternatively, for a required finding of not guilty due to insufficient evidence, which the trial effectively denied. It found him guilty of violating the registration provision. On appeal and a sua sponte transfer from the Appeals Court, the court noted that defendant was homeless. The court found that he complied with his statutory obligations under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect; 178F 1/2 and the instructions promulgated by the Board. There was insufficient evidence to show that defendant knowingly provided false information to the Board about his residence or knowingly failed to provide notice of his intent to change his address.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent attorney contested the information filed in the Supreme Judicial Court for the County of Suffolk (Massachusetts) by the Board of Bar Overseers, which recommended that the attorney be disbarred. The board alleged that the attorney violated Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct. R. 3:07, Canon 1, DR 1-102(A)(2) and (4)-(6), and Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct. R. 3:07, Canon 7, DR 7-102(A), with regard to his plan to discredit a superior court judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The attorney was admitted to the bar in 1977 and was employed by a private firm. The attorney was part of an intricate plan to discredit the superior court judge, who presided in a case in which he represented some of the litigants. The aim of the plan was to influence the outcome of the litigation by forcing the judge's recusal and obtain reversal of her prior rulings against the attorney's clients. In furtherance of the scheme, the attorney, with his own investigators posing as corporate executives, set up and secretly made a tape recording of a sham job interview for a former law clerk of the judge, during which the law clerk repeatedly was questioned about the judge's personal and professional character and her decision-making process in the ongoing matter involving the attorney's clients. The attorney then used the taped interview to coax and threaten the law clerk into providing sworn statements damaging the judge. The court found no question that the case called for the attorney's disbarment, particularly as a result of the egregious and extensive nature of his conduct. The court noted the attorney's lack of candor before the special hearing officer as an aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court adopted the board's recommendation and disbarred the attorney. The court remanded the case to the county court for a judgment of disbarment to be entered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of trafficking in cocaine. He appealed; the Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed. He sought further review, alleging that his rights under Mass. Const. Decl.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Police detained a man to whom a box containing cocaine had been shipped. He told them he had agreed with defendant to accept delivery of the box and give it to defendant in exchange for cash. He agreed to call defendant; an officer stood nearby and without the aid of listening devices overheard the conversation between defendant and the informant. Defendant said he was immediately coming to get the box; the officer placed an electronic monitoring device in the informant's pocket. After defendant arrived, another officer in a car outside was able to hear a portion of defendant's conversation with the informant through the device. The high court held that the police properly asked the informant to call defendant so he could promptly substantiate his story. Once he called defendant and defendant said he was coming to get the box, both probable cause and exigent circumstances were present, as police had no time to obtain a warrant. The prosecution's failure to give defendant a transcript of the intercepted conversation, in violation of &sect; 99(O)(2), did not result in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, because testimony about that conversation was scanty and cumulative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Following the denial of his motion to suppress, a jury in the Superior Court Department, Worcester (Massachusetts), convicted defendant of possession of child pornography, in violation of Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In upholding the denial of defendant's motion to suppress, the supreme judicial court found that the affidavit supporting the warrant established probable cause to believe that child pornography would be found in defendant's apartment, as it included information about defendant's e-mail use and the officer's extensive knowledge in the area, which allowed for an inference that defendant possessed child pornography. Defendant also argued that his conviction could not stand, as Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect;&nbsp;29C was vague or overbroad. The supreme judicial court did not find the statute unconstitutional. Among other things, the supreme judicial court noted that, contrary to defendant's contention, the term &quot;depiction by computer&quot; could not reasonably have been interpreted to mean images created without the use of real children. In addition, any overbreadth that might have existed due to the lack of an exemption for artistic or scientific materials could have been cured through case-by-case analysis. Finally, the supreme judicial court noted that in many instances the fact that a child was under 18 would be obvious, but that a defendant was free to present evidence of an honest mistake.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The district court judge refused to dismiss the case, ruling that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, &sect; 19A gave it the discretion to retain cases with amounts in controversy likely to exceed $ 25,000. The high court disagreed. As the $ 25,000 limit of Mass. Gen.

However, if the defense was properly raised, the district court had to provide an opportunity for written responses from the parties, and hold a hearing if a party so requested. If satisfied that there was a reasonable likelihood the plaintiff would recover more than $ 25,000, it had to dismiss the complaint. If no objection was raised, it had the discretion sua sponte to dismiss the action or allow it to proceed. Before dismissal, however, it had to solicit written responses from the parties and, if requested to do so, hold a hearing. As defendant timely raised the amounts-in-controversy limitation in his answer, the district court was required to dismiss the case for failure to comply with the requirements of Mass. Gen.

On appeal to the trial court's appellate division under Mass. Gen.

The trial judge ruled that failure to retain the inmate in strict security at the state hospital would create a likelihood of serious harm. The supreme judicial court found that the trial judge erred in using the reasonable doubt standard as the best means of conserving government resources. There was no reason to depart from the general civil rule of requiring the inmate to prove his case by a fair preponderance of the evidence. Although the trial judge found that the failure to retain the inmate in the strict security of the state hospital would create a likelihood of serious harm whether he applied either the proof beyond a reasonable doubt or the fair preponderance of the evidence standard, he erred in using the reasonable doubt standard.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 40B, &sect;&sect; 20-23. The state supreme court held that, viewed in light of the statutory mandate, the required deference to administrative actions, and prior decisions, it could not say that the below-market interest rate loans did not constitute a subsidy for purposes of the Act. Nor could the supreme court deem unreasonable the committee's conclusion that a government subsidy was involved where a legislatively-created and monitored entity, the FHLBB, advanced construction funds to a developer of affordable housing at below-market interest rates to advance the legislative purpose of supporting and stabilizing the financing of residential housing. Thus, the committee properly determined that the funding was a valid subsidy program.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that at the hearing in the instant case, the prosecutor set forth only those facts relevant to the underlying offense, apparently believing that after defendant entered a plea on that offense, the second step of the bifurcated procedure would take place.

After the land court rendered a final judgment in defendants' favor, it denied the residents' motion to amend the judgment on the basis that an erroneous finding was made that they lacked standing. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the board could override local &quot;requirements and regulations&quot; once the town had satisfied its minimum affordable housing obligation. While &sect; 21 did not specify the standard to be used to evaluate an application for a comprehensive permit, the court held that the &quot;consistent with local needs&quot; standard in Mass. Gen.

The trial court abused its discretion in allowing the complainant to testify in detail about seven unindicted incidents and that the testimony overwhelmed the evidence of the two incidents with which defendant was charged. Defense counsel was ineffective in several instances, including a failure to interview a witness prior to making an opening statement referring to the witness's testimony and then not calling the witness resulting in a missing witness instruction. The appellate court added further requirements applicable where the records sought by defendant from a third party were presumptively covered by statutory privilege. In regard to a Mass. R. Crim.

The supreme judicial court held substantive and procedural due process protections of a level one sex offender who committed a sexually violent crime against a child were not offended. His liberty and privacy interests were not fundamental, and the registration requirement was implemented fairly. His minimal threat was correctly found and statutory and regulatory factors showed a low reoffense risk and degree of dangerousness. His admitted misconduct showed repetitive and compulsive behavior, and he sexually assaulted a child, an extravulnerable child, and an extrafamilial victim. His treatment did not remove his reoffense risk and degree of dangerousness. Wrongly considering a filed guilty finding on a second charge was immaterial, as misconduct underlying the charge could be considered. His incurable pedophilia diagnosis was a &quot;mental abnormality&quot; and &quot;high risk&quot; factor under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect; 178K(1)(a)(i) and 803 Mass.

Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 13(a) expired, a timely filed petition for trial was a prerequisite to any further period of confinement. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 14(a) required the filing of a distinct petition for trial after the qualified examiners' reports were filed. A request for trial in the original Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 12(b) petition, or a trial petition filed prior to the filing of the qualified examiners' reports, was not effective, as it would fail to serve all of the purposes that were to be served by the petition for trial. Dismissal was the appropriate remedy for any violation of the 60-day deadline, absent extraordinary circumstances.</SPAN></P>

While being held in lieu of bail at a county jail, he was involved in a violent altercation with a correction officer that led to further charges. While awaiting a disciplinary hearing, the detainee was transferred by the Commissioner to a state institution. The supreme judicial court found, inter alia, that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 52A authorized the transfer without a judicial determination. In addition, the detainee had adequate alternative avenues by which to assert his challenges to his transfer and the conditions of his pretrial confinement. His could bring a civil action against the Commissioner, where an appropriate factual record could be developed for judicial review. Consequently, the single justice was correct to deny the detainee's Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, &sect; 3 petition.</SPAN></P>

The trust cross-appealed the order denying it further remedy after its request for a preliminary injunction was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">There was no appeal from the denial of the preliminary injunction requested by the trust and, therefore, the property at issue was demolished. The second sentence of the ordinance at issue exempted from the authority of the historical commission any buildings, structures, or properties however owned or controlled by the town's library and museum association and Roman Catholic Bishop. The motion judge determined that the exemption, based on the identity of a property owner, was not authorized by the Historic Districts Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40C. The court held that the second sentence of the ordinance was valid to the extent that it applied to property owned or controlled by the diocese or the association at the time the ordinance was adopted. The court agreed, however, that the second sentence was not lawfully applicable to after-acquired property. Further, based on the erroneous interpretation of the ordinance, the historical commission allowed the demolition of property that the association acquired long after the ordinance was adopted thereby entitling the trust to further remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court vacated the final judgment and declared that the second sentence of the ordinance was valid and applied only to properties owned and controlled by the association or the bishop at the time the ordinance was adopted.

The commission denied plaintiffs' appeal, concluding that Personnel Administration Rule 10, which permitted special certifications based on gender, was a valid exercise of the MBTA's human resources division's rule making authority under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &sect; 3 and provided the authority to fill positions in favor of protected groups previously discriminated against. The court held that the MBTA's evidence of gross statistical disparities between the number of women who were qualified to be police officers in Massachusetts and the number of women who were hired for positions in the MBTA police department constituted prima facie evidence of a past practice of discrimination. As such, the court determined that plaintiffs failed to meet their ultimate burden of demonstrating that the implementation of Rule 10 was not justified.</SPAN></P>

However, the father refused to consent to the removal of the children. The judge found that the schools in Massachusetts which the children were attending were preferable to those where the mother wanted to move, particularly for one child with special needs; that uprooting the children would be detrimental to their interests; that the move would cause a reduction of the father's parenting time that would not have been in the children's interests; that misconduct allegations against a step-sibling weighed against increased time in the mother's household; and that there was insufficient evidence of financial imperative to justify the mother's move. On appeal, the court found that the trial judge appropriately considered the best interests of the children, and did not abuse her discretion in concluding that removal of the children would not serve their best interests. Further, the refusal to authorize removal did not violate the mother's constitutional rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to interstate travel.</SPAN></P>

The phrase excluded the power to vacate a decision determining the rights of the parties in a particular case. It did not bar &quot;overruling&quot; the prospective application of a court decision, by amending the Constitution.

The state supreme court found that defendants failed to show that the integrity of the grand jury process was impaired. The evidence in the prosecutor's possession was that defendants' actions did not qualify for the exemption. The state supreme court could not say that the withheld evidence would have greatly undermined the credibility of the Commonwealth's case. Furthermore, the state supreme court held that the legislature's delegation of responsibility for defining terms of the agricultural exemption did not violate the nondelegation doctrine of Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 30. The delegation of the definitions of &quot;land in agricultural use&quot; and &quot;normal maintenance or improvement&quot; of such land simply directed the agency to work out the details for implementing the policy stated by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, the Commonwealth argued that the statute violated the separation of powers pursuant to Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 30 and violated public policy. The state supreme court concluded that the statute was constitutional and there was no merit to the Commonwealth's public policy argument. Specifically, a dismissal was a disposition. The statute called for dismissal of the charges, in the judge's discretion, only after an accord and satisfaction was executed. The statute thus did not give the judge unfettered discretion. Besides requiring that the injured party appear before the court and acknowledge, in writing, that he or she had been satisfied, the statute required, among other things, that defendant be accused of a misdemeanor for which he could be liable in a civil action, and that the crime was not committed against a law enforcement officer or with intent to commit a felony. Thus, the statute was a valid exercise of legislative authority and the trial judge did not err in declaring the statute constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The board appealed. The court found that the board had the authority to promulgate the regulation and that its authority to do so was not preempted by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 270, &sect; 22, which was the statewide law banning smoking. The Regulation was not vague or overbroad, did not violate any rights of the associations or their members to privacy under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. c. 214, &sect; 1B, to assembly under the United States Constitution, or to the free exercise of religion. In addition, the associations have not established a violation of the Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &sect; 11.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The patient was assaulted in a Department-sponsored group home and sought to require the Department to modify his individual service plan (ISP) to provide one-on-one care and a private room. The supreme court held the trial court's orders did not allow an attorney's fees' award, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, as they did not materially alter the parties' legal relationship. No consent decree was entered. The Department substantially agreed to give the patient a private room and one-to-one care and incorporated a one-to-one care provision in his ISP. It contested the judge's authority to order specific services in the ISP but agreed to what the patient sought, so the judge saw no need to grant an injunction. The &quot;judicial imprimatur&quot; required for an attorney's fee award was absent. Finding the patient was a member of a plaintiff class in a prior suit did not change his relationship with the Department, which was decided in the prior case. A hearing at which the judge ostensibly ordered relief the Department did not provide by a certain date contained no order. The judge only &quot;asked&quot; the Department to do what it had &quot;agreed to,&quot; so it was not in contempt for not providing it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court's judgment vacating its earlier award of attorney's fees was affirmed, but its order holding the Department in contempt and awarding damages to the patient was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's convictions arose from the murder of a woman in the bathroom of a rest area next to the fast food restaurant that defendant worked. Defendant was arrested at the scene and later confessed. Media coverage of the crime was extensive. Some of that coverage focused on defendant's criminal history, which was also extensive. Defendant's main contentions of error on appeal were that his confession should have been suppressed because it, nor the waiver of his Miranda rights, was voluntary, and that the trial judge should have excluded jurors that had been exposed to the media coverage. The court found no errors, concluding that the factual findings of the voluntariness of defendant's confession and waiver of his Miranda rights were fully supported by the record, noting that defendant was repeatedly given his Miranda rights and he signed the waiver forms. Defendant told the arresting office that he was carrying a knife, which waived his right to remain silent and when asked if he wanted to speak once at the police station, defendant commented that he needed a few minutes to figure some things out, which indicated that defendant fairly understood his right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent attorney appealed from a judgment of a single justice of the court upholding findings of a hearing committee of petitioner Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers that the attorney had committed numerous ethical violations over the course of three cases and ordering his disbarment. The attorney challenged the sufficiency of the evidence as to certain charges, as well as violations of his free speech and due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In the first of three matters, the attorney, among other things, misrepresented to his clients that they were responsible for paying sanctions that had been imposed on him for baseless filings and other misconduct. In the second, he made accusations against another attorney and then accused a judge of bias when she refused to sustain them. In the third, he misrepresented to opposing counsel and the court that his client had authorized a settlement when she had not. The court focused on the charges relating to conversion of client funds and groundless accusations against a judge before whom the attorney had a matter. The hearing committee was entitled to make its own credibility judgments regarding the conversion allegations, and it plainly had found the attorney not credible at all. In determining the scope of the attorney's right to criticize the judge, the court adopted the majority standard, which required the attorney to have an objective basis for any charges made. In the case before it, there was no evidence supporting the accusations. Disbarment was the presumptive sanction for taking client funds, and it was especially justified in the instant case by aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the judgment of disbarment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statutory requirement did not infringe any constitutionally protected right to travel as every disabled veteran who bought a home in Massachusetts could eventually qualify. The requirement bore a rational relationship to the public purpose of providing some tax relief, in a state with high housing costs, for disabled veterans who had owned their homes long enough for real estate taxes to have risen beyond their means to pay them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The child victim was defendant's four-year-old daughter. The court affirmed, rejecting defendant's appellate arguments regarding the sufficiency of the rape indictment, the sufficiency of the evidence, the admission of a prior armed robbery conviction for impeachment, and that the rape and assault charges were duplicative. Also, based on the &quot;fresh witness&quot; doctrine as it stood at the time of defendant's trial, testimony from the child's mother and a police officer was properly admitted. However, the court made significant changes in the fresh witness doctrine, ruling that from the date of the issuance of the rescript of its opinion, the doctrine would be known as the &quot;first complaint&quot; doctrine. Under that doctrine the recipient of a complainant's first complaint of sexual assault could testify about the fact of the first complaint and the circumstances surrounding the making of the first complaint. The witness could also testify about the details of the complaint. Likewise, the complainant could testify as to the details of the first complaint, as well as why the complaint was made at that particular time. Testimony from additional complaint witnesses would not be admissible.</SPAN></P>

In a sentencing memorandum the Commonwealth filed, it noted that several years earlier, defendant had been convicted on 10 counts of indecent assault and battery on a child. Without a hearing, the trial court sentenced him to prison on the conviction and to community parole supervision for life (CPSL) under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 45. On appeal, the state supreme court found that the trial court did not properly sentence him. It found that he could not be sentenced to community supervision for life under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 45 because he had not been charged or indicted as a repeat offender and to allow otherwise would violate Mass. Const. pt. 1, art. 12, which entitled him to notice of predicate offenses that the Commonwealth would use in an attempt to enhance his sentence if he was convicted. It also found that Mass. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Middlesex Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) convicted defendant of murder in the first degree on a theory of felony-murder. The predicate felony was defendant's attempted commission of armed robbery while masked in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 17. He was also convicted of armed assault with intent to rob and unlawful possession of a firearm. Defendant appealed his convictions and the denial of his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The murder took place during an attempted armed robbery of a convenience store clerk and was recorded by three surveillance cameras. On appeal, defendant raised numerous issues. The state supreme court concluded that use of the surveillance tape by the police to identify defendant and then to elicit a confession from him did not violate the Massachusetts wiretap statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 99, because the officers' actions were not unlawful where they had no part in making, inducing, soliciting, or otherwise encouraging or abetting the making of the surveillance tape. As to the federal wiretap statute,&nbsp;18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2510 et seq., the trial judge correctly concluded that any expectation defendant claimed of privacy in his statements objectively was unreasonable in the circumstances: he shouted threats and obscenities at a clerk in a convenience store open to the public. However, the conviction of armed assault with intent to rob had to be vacated because it was duplicative of the felony-murder conviction where it was a predicate felony that merged into the felony-murder conviction as a lesser included offense.</SPAN></P>

A massive tunnel construction project underneath the Commonwealth's capital city took many years and cost many times its original estimates, attracting attention across the nation, and the Governor, dissatisfied with the chairman's stewardship, sought the Justices' advice as to whether the statute also empowered him to demote and replace the chairman. The Justices noted that the constitutional provision limited their power to answer such questions to solemn occasions involving present duties. Generally, such occasions did not include the need to construe existing statutes or to adjudicate private property or employment rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court granted an application for direct appellate review by plaintiffs, the Commonwealth and two redevelopment authorities, after the Superior Court Department, Suffolk (Massachusetts), denied their motion for partial summary judgment as against one of several defendants, conceded earlier polluters of a convention center site, in an action to recover reimbursement of site clean-up costs from all polluters, jointly and severally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The convention center legislation, 1997 Mass. Acts ch. 152, &sect; 3(d), had expressly exempted the authorities from liability under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &sect; 5 for cleanup costs of the convention site unless they were shown to have participated in the pollution. One of the conceded past polluters argued that the Commonwealth should be liable with it because it had failed to bring suit earlier, but the court noted that nothing in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E obliged suit to be brought ever. It was entirely discretionary. The authorities were properly exempt under the convention center legislation, which did not confer an unconstitutional exemption in light of the legislation's important public purpose. Finally, the authorities could seek reimbursement of their costs incurred under ch. 21E, &sect; 4 on a joint and several basis because a reference in that statute to equitable shares referred only to contribution actions between joint polluters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court vacated the order denying partial summary judgment, holding that none of the plaintiffs had any potential liability and that all the polluters faced joint and several liability.

Ordinances &sect; 46-12 (1995) violated plaintiff nightclub operator's Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 16 free speech guarantees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The public indecency ordinance contained a recitation of purpose lifted from a federal constitutional case in which such an ordinance had been upheld because of its purpose to protect the public from certain effects of adult uses. The court held that while such language, sincere or not, might have enabled the ordinance to pass muster under the First Amendment, art. 16 was more protective of free speech rights, and an ordinance that banned nudity altogether violated rights guarantees and was, moreover, impermissibly overbroad in reaching all kinds of innocent behavior. The operator was therefore entitled to issuance of an entertainment license, although he would have to seek a new zoning variance because he could not argue that a variance granted back before there was any nude dancing in the nightclub somehow turned such entertainment into a protected nonconforming use. Finally, even though he still needed a variance, the operator had obtained judgments granting much of the relief he sought against constitutional violations, although in the end it was based primarily on the state constitution, so he was entitled to an award of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff taxpayers challenged the effective date and enforcement of a new capital gains rate for transactions occurring prior to a certain date. They asserted that the rate violated Mass. Const. amend. art. XLIV. They argued that 2004 Mass Acts 149, &sect;&sect; 413 and 414 were integrated to the extent that both sections had to be invalidated. A single justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court submitted several questions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayers had realized capital gains. They contended that taxing capital gains for the 2002 tax year at different rates based on whether they were realized before or a certain date as set out in 2004 Mass Acts 149, &sect; 413, violated the uniformity requirement of Mass. Const. amend. art. XLIV. The court held that the exemption was not &quot;reasonable&quot; as it was not limited in scope. Indeed, it had no dollar limit at all. It was not premised on any inability to pay or on any attempt to rectify some other imbalance in the income tax laws. Instead, without regard to ability to pay, it created a sizeable imbalance in the income tax burdens borne by taxpayers. 2004 Mass. Acts 149, &sect; 413 had to be struck as violative of Mass. Const. amend. art. XLIV. The effective date set forth in 2004 Mass. Acts 149, &sect; 414 stood on its own without the exemption and was fully operative as a law. It would have been illogical to conclude that the Massachusetts Legislature would have opted to postpone implementation of the new increased rate and forgo the corresponding increased revenues for an entire year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's conviction arose from a series of homophobic statements she made over the course of more than one and one-half years to and about the two complaining witnesses, who were tenants that lived across the hall from defendant in an apartment building. The gist of the statements made by defendant referred to the complaining witnesses as faggots and queers and contained threats that she would &quot;get them&quot; at some point. Defendant contended on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to support her convictions and that &sect; 43A was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face because it criminalized protected speech. The court upheld the constitutionality of &sect;&nbsp;43A and noted that it reached only speech that was constitutionally unprotected, such as fighting words. However, because only two of the statements made by defendant were proper for consideration under the statute as a pattern or series as the other statements occurred prior to the effective date of &sect; 43A, the court was compelled to reverse defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The newspaper sought the names and addresses of the appointees, but the sheriff refused, successfully arguing that they were not public records. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the requested records were &quot;made or received&quot; by a public official, the sheriff, as those terms were used in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 4, &sect; 7, Twenty-Sixth, and that no exemption to the statutory definition of public records applied. The court noted that it did not need to decide whether the reserve deputy sheriffs were holders of public office because its holding rested on a conclusion that the sheriff, in appointing reserve deputy sheriffs, exercised a power of his public office; therefore the records of his appointments were &quot;made or received&quot; by the sheriff and were subject to the public records laws. The court found no merit to the sheriff's claim that disclosure of the names and addresses of the appointees to the office of reserve deputy sheriff would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 4, &sect; 7, Twenty-Sixth(c) because the names and addresses of adults were not &quot;intimate details&quot; of a &quot;highly personal nature.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The Commonwealth unsuccessfully moved for an order that defendant submit to an interview with its proposed expert. On review, the court affirmed, finding that a defendant subject to commitment as a sexually dangerous person did not need not to submit to an examination by an expert selected by the district attorney, and that such a defendant's refusal to participate in such an examination could not result in the barring of expert testimony presented in his defense at a commitment trial. The court found that Mass. Gen.

Laws ch. 121A, &sect; 6A, the housing owners entered into a contract with the city, agreeing to be bound by the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 121A which required the housing owners to pay the city an &quot;urban redevelopment excise tax.&quot; Because of their statutory exemption from State and local taxation under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 121A, &sect; 10, the housing owners received preferential tax treatment. The housing owners subsequently attempted to persuade the city to address the significant gap between their payments and the payments they would have been making if they were subject to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59. In addition, they sought abatements for several tax years. The appellate court held that to interpret Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 121A to include a cap on the amount developers had to pay would require the court to read words into the statute that were not there. The fact that the concessions did not continue for the entire term of the contracts did not violate them. The contracts were unambiguous and had to be enforced in accordance with their plain terms. The equal protection claims also failed as the housing owners were not similarly situated with other developers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A city employee allegedly said the candidate could seek office as a Republican, even though he was a registered Democrat, and he changed parties to do so. The supreme judicial court held Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &sect; 48 precluded him from running as a Republican as he was enrolled as a Democrat during the prior year and changed parties less than 90 days before the filing deadline. The same law precluded him from running as a Democrat. Under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &sect; 6, he could not be an unenrolled candidate as he was affiliated with a party less than 90 days before the filing deadline. These laws did not unconstitutionally deny ballot access, nor did they impose improper qualifications for holding office above Mass. Const. art. 16. If he succeeded as a write-in candidate, nothing disqualified him from holding office. The city was not estopped to deny him a place on the ballot due to allegedly negligent advice as estoppel would frustrate the Commonwealth's interest in a stable political system. If estoppel applied, other equitable considerations militated against it as the candidate delayed seeking judicial relief, which, if granted, would disrupt the general election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Hampden Superior Court Department (Massachusetts), which convicted him of murder in the first degree, on a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty, in connection with the beating death of a 14-month old child. Defendant was also convicted on two indictments charging assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon and assault and battery, and four indictments for permitting bodily injury to a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant lived with his girlfriend and her three children. Defendant's primary contention on appeal was that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. The court disagreed and found that the evidence sufficiently established that he acted with malice and that the fatal blow to the deceased child's abdomen was delivered with tremendous force. Neighbors had witnessed numerous injuries to the deceased child while the child was in defendant's care as well as had observed defendant inflict certain acts of physical abuse on the deceased child and her two older siblings. The court noted that a conviction for child abuse was not limited to a parent, but covered any caregiver. Defendant's failure to raise any objection to the manner in which the murder indictment was served upon him prevented him from raising such defect on appeal. The court did find error with regard to one conviction for assault and battery in that the indictment was submitted to the jury on theories of both principal and joint venture liability, and the jury returned a general verdict, which caused the necessity of a new trial on that charge only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court set aside defendant's conviction of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon on one of the older children and remanded that indictment for a new trial. The court affirmed the remaining convictions, affirmed the trial court's order denying defendant's motion for a new trial, as well as denied his request for relief based on any insufficiency of the evidence claim.</SPAN></P>
