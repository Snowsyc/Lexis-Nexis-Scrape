Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-59(a)(5); carrying a pistol without a permit, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-35(a) (Rev. to 2001); and criminal possession of pistol or revolver, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-217c(a)(1) (Rev. to 2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing by the trial court, defendant's sentence was enhanced for being a persistent dangerous felony offender, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-40(a) and (h). On appeal, defendant claimed that certain prosecutorial improprieties deprived him of a fair trial and that his sentence enhancement as a persistent dangerous felony offender violated his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury, because a finding that was a necessary predicate to the enhancement was made by the trial court, rather than by the jury, which should have made that finding beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that defendant was improperly asked to judge the credibility of the State's witnesses but that the error did not deprive him of a fair trial. However, the court did find that the trial court violated the dictates of Apprendi and its progeny when it imposed the sentence enhancement after its determination that defendant's history and character, and the nature and circumstances of his criminal conduct, indicated that extended incarceration and lifetime supervision would best serve the public interest as such a determination was for the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment only as to the sentence imposed and remanded the case to the trial court for a new sentencing proceeding. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the owner of a landfill gas energy facility, filed an administrative appeal against defendants, the Department of Public Utility Control, a utility, and the Office of Consumer Counsel. Plaintiff challenged the Department's decision regarding certain renewable energy certificates. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Britain (Connecticut) dismissed the appeal. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2003, the utility filed a petition with the Department requesting that the Department reopen a 1996 proceeding and issue a declaratory ruling that plaintiff was required to transfer renewable energy certificates to the utility pursuant to a 1997 electricity purchase agreement. In 2004, the Department held that it had jurisdiction over the matter under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-176 and other state statutes. It held that the utility was entitled to ownership of the certificates on the ground that plaintiff's renewable source of fuel was the necessary condition for the Department's approval of the 1997 agreement. The trial court upheld the Department's decision and dismissed the appeal. The court stated that in a companion case, it had addressed substantially identical claims and had concluded that the Department had jurisdiction over the dispute, that there was substantial evidence to support the 2004 decision, and that the 2004 decision was not an unconstitutional taking under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. It adopted the reasoning and conclusions of the companion case. Accordingly, it rejected plaintiff's claims on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of his motion to suppress, a jury convicted defendant of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-55a, three counts of assault in the first degree under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-59(a)(5), and carrying a pistol without a permit under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-35(a). The Superior Court in the judicial district of New London (Connecticut) sentenced him to 48 years imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress on the ground that he did not have standing to challenge the legality of the search of a family member's apartment under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;7. The supreme court disagreed, finding, inter alia, that Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;7 did not embody the automatic standing doctrine or the &quot;legitimately on the premises&quot; rules of standing. In order to have had standing, defendant needed to prove that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy, which defendant failed to do. Defendant also argued that the evidence was insufficient to establish his identity as the shooter. The supreme court disagreed, noting that the jury could reasonably have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that he had a motive to shoot the victims, was present at the time of the shooting, and possessed the gun that was used. Finally, defendant claimed that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the reasonable doubt standard in violation of his federal constitutional right to a fair trial. The supreme court found no error, noting that the instructions, when considered as a whole, were not improper.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the convictions, and it agreed with the trial court's evidentiary ruling regarding the victim's statement to an acquaintance that &quot;she got him.&quot; The court held that the statement, which indicated a potential fabrication, was not within the state of mind hearsay exception under Conn. Code Evid. R. 8-3(4), as it was a statement of past intent or motive after an act, rather than a statement of present or future intent. On certified review, the court initially held that the appropriate standard of review of an evidentiary ruling was based on the specific nature of the claim. Defendant was deemed to have abandoned the claim that the statement was not hearsay.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the State of Connecticut, appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New London at Norwich (Connecticut), which dismissed its appeal from the decision of a family support magistrate terminating the child support orders against defendant father, retroactive to the 18th birthday of his minor child. The State was the party plaintiff on behalf of the named plaintiff, the child's mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and father were never married. The child was born on November 8, 1986, and the father was the acknowledged father of the child. The State had been providing public assistance for the child and applied to the trial court in 1990 for a support order, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-172(b) (Rev. to 1989). In 2004, the family support magistrate ordered the father to appear to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court for failing to pay. The family support magistrate ordered termination of the support order as of November 8, 2004, since the child attained his 18th birthday at that time, though the child was still in high school. The trial court determined that 2004 Conn. Pub. Acts 04-100, which extended the obligation of child support for non-married individuals until the child was 19 years old or graduated from high school, whichever occurred first, did not apply retroactively. The court disagreed, concluding that though P.A. 04-100 did not set forth explicitly that it applied retroactively, applying the public act differently to children of married parents versus unmarried parents violated equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with directions for it to sustain the State's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The limited liability company applied to the commissioner for a permit to construct an asphalt batching facility. The commissioner issued a permit to the limited liability company, which included both a permit to construct an asphalt plant and a conditional permit to operate a plant. However, the permit expired after the limited liability company failed to fulfill a condition. The legislature then enacted Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-196 (Rev. 1999), which restricted where an asphalt batching plant could be placed. As a result, the asphalt batching facility could not be placed on its property. It filed an action seeking a determination that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court, however, entered judgment for the commissioner. On appeal, the state supreme court found that since no fundamental right or suspect class was involved, the rational basis test applied and the statute was rationally related to the legitimate goal of protecting public health and the environment. It also found that the statute was not improperly applied retroactively to the limited liability company since it could not obtain a permit to operate the asphalt batching plant in the proposed location.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimant appealed from the decision of the compensation review board (Connecticut), which affirmed the decision of appellee, the workers' compensation commissioner for the third district, that dismissed plaintiff's claim for benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act (the state act), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-275 et seq., which arose from an injury while working for defendant employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was in the business of unloading ships in a harbor and was injured while descending a ship's hold after a step broke beneath him. Plaintiff filed a claim under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq., and was awarded compensation. Plaintiff subsequently filed his claim under the state act, which the commissioner dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, plaintiff claimed that the board improperly concluded that the commissioner lacked jurisdiction over his claim because the injury occurred on the navigable waters of the United States and, therefore, the federal government had exclusive jurisdiction over the claim under U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 and the longshore act. The court agreed with plaintiff and held that the state has concurrent jurisdiction with the federal government over claims involving injuries incurred on navigable waters when the employer and the employee are locally based, the employment contract is performed within the state and partly on land, the injury took place on the state's territorial waters and the employer was required under the state act to secure compensation for any land based injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that plaintiff's claim was governed by federal case law and fell squarely within the twilight zone doctrine as adopted by the United States Supreme Court in those cases. As such, the court held that the board improperly determined that the claim was not within the jurisdiction of the commissioner. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the board with direction to sustain plaintiff's appeal.</SPAN></P>

Her passenger was a domiciliary of Florida, the vehicle owned by both parties was principally garaged there, and the ALI for both parties was issued in Florida. During an extended visit by the passenger with the driver, her daughter, in Connecticut, the passenger was injured in an automobile accident. The UPI provided a defense to an action brought by the passenger, and it paid her damages pursuant to an arbitration award. The UPI then filed suit against the ALI, seeking indemnification. The trial court granted the UPI's motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability, finding that the matter was controlled by Connecticut law, and that the household exclusion was not valid under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-335(d). The appellate court reversed that decision and remanded the matter with directions to enter judgment for the ALI, finding that Florida law was controlling and accordingly, the exclusion applied. On further review pursuant to certification, Florida was deemed to have the most significant relationship with the claims, as it was the principal location of the insured risk and application thereof did not offend Connecticut law.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&nbsp;53a-71(a) violated his right to sexual privacy under the state and federal constitutions. The supreme court agreed with the State that, even if defendant had a right to engage in noncommercial consensual sexual intercourse with individuals over the age of consent, that right did not protect sexual intimacy in the context of an inherently coercive relationship, such as the teacher-student relationship, wherein consent might not easily be refused. The supreme court further concluded that joinder of the offenses against two victims was proper because, if the cases had been tried separately, the evidence of defendant's uncharged sexual misconduct with each victim would have been admissible to establish a common scheme or plan; among other things, the victims were both juniors in high school, the conduct began with kissing, and the conduct occurred in similar settings. Finally, the supreme court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the constancy of accusation testimony by friends of the victims outweighed its prejudicial effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business owners filed an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against defendant officials. Plaintiffs argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-342, which prohibited smoking in restaurants and cafes, violated the Equal Protection Clause and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford (Connecticut) granted defendants' motion to strike. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first noted that plaintiffs had not provided notice to interested persons under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 17-56(b). Overruling its past precedent, the court held that the failure to notify interested persons in a declaratory judgment action, like noncompliance with joinder rules, did not implicate the court's subject matter jurisdiction. As for due process concerns, the interests of nonparties who might be interested in the present action were represented adequately by the current parties. Next, in exempting existing private clubs from the ban, the legislature reasonably might have been endeavoring to protect the financial investment and settled expectations of their members. This was a rational basis for the exemption. As for the exemption of casinos, Connecticut casinos were operated by Native American tribes pursuant to gaming compacts. Uncertainties concerning the legislature's power to regulate the tribes, as well as the state's ability to enforce such a regulation, were sufficient to provide a rational basis for the casino exemptions. The legislature might have also had concerns about the tribes' sovereignty or their relationships with the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue on appeal was whether an inmate had a cognizable liberty interest in his parole eligibility status sufficient to invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of a habeas court. The state supreme court concluded such a liberty interest did not exist. There was no constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence. Whether and to what extent a State created a liberty interest in parole by statute was entirely at the discretion of the State. The state supreme court held that there was no indication in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-125a (Rev. to 2001) that the legislature intended to assure an inmate's parole eligibility status upon serving 50 percent of his or her sentence. Thus, the statute did not create a liberty interest sufficient to invoke habeas corpus jurisdiction. The state supreme court held that the inmate's claim that parole eligibility was an integral part of a criminal sentence was unavailing, as parole eligibility statute was not within the terms of the sentence imposed. Thus, the state supreme court held that the appellate court erred in reversing the dismissal of the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former inmate sued defendant former warden and correction officer, in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut) for personal injuries, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court denied defendants' motion to dismiss and granted the inmate's motion to strike defenses and defendants' setoff claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate said the officer confined him with another inmate, who assaulted him. The supreme court held state sovereign immunity law did not govern the warden's asserted sovereign immunity defense because a federal right's vindication, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, was at issue, and state law could not immunize wrongful conduct under &sect; 1983. Under federal law, sovereign immunity did not bar the inmate's claim, which was unambiguously stated against the warden individually. The state's agreement to indemnify the warden was irrelevant to whether the Eleventh amendment barred the claim against him, as he gave no reason why the relief the inmate sought could not come solely from him. Thus, the inmate's claim was not actually against the state. The only issue was whether, regardless of its strength, sovereign immunity barred the inmate's claim, not whether the inmate's conclusory allegation of inadequate training was a &quot;fact&quot; sufficient to establish the warden's individual liability. Whether the pleaded facts showed liability did not bear on an analysis of whether, under federal substantive law, the warden was sued in his individual capacity.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 53a-167a (Rev. to 2001). The appellate court (Connecticut) reversed the judgment of conviction pertaining to that count. The state supreme court granted the State's petition for certification to appeal limited to the issue of whether the appellate court properly construed and applied Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police responded to a report that defendant had vandalized a truck. An officer found defendant on public property near the truck. Defendant refused to produce identification upon the officer's request. The charge of interfering with a police officer was based on that refusal. The appellate court found that the refusal to produce identification did not constitute a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-167a (Rev. to 2001). The supreme court found that the statute did not categorically exclude from its purview a refusal to provide identification to a police officer who had sought such identification pursuant to a valid Terry stop, as such a refusal could hamper or impede a police investigation into apparent criminal activity. The supreme court further held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The complainant had identified defendant by name. Thus, obtaining the identity of the individual found near the truck was a logical and necessary step in the investigation. Although the police eventually ascertained the identity of defendant, his refusal to comply with the officer's request for identification delayed the progress of the police investigation.</SPAN></P>

However, it concluded that there was no need to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion for a continuance on the basis of the record before it because, even if it did, defendant had made no claim that he was prejudiced in any way by the denial. One of the shooting victim's testimony was admissible under Conn. Code Evid. R. 4-5(b) on the issue of motive where he testified that, two to three weeks before the shooting, defendant had had an angry confrontation with an eyewitness during which he displayed a gun and that he also threatened the victim with the gun. The testimony tended to show that defendant harbored hostility toward the eyewitness and the victim. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had been one of the shooters.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases involving two victims, a jury in the Superior Court, New London, Connecticut, convicted defendant of first degree sexual assault, second degree sexual assault, and risk of injury to a child, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-70(a)(2) (1993), as amended by 1993 Conn. Acts 340, &sect; 14; 53a-71(a)(1) (1993), as amended by 1993 Conn. Acts 340, &sect; 2; and 53-21 (1993), respectively. Defendant appealed his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that (1) his prosecution on all charges, except the second degree sexual assault charge, were time barred, and (2) the trial court improperly admitted victim one's testimony, which was allegedly the product of hypnosis. With respect to the first issue, the supreme court agreed with the State that defendant's prosecution for the abuse of victim one was timely because the limitations period under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-193a (1993), as amended by 1993 Conn. Acts 340, &sect; 11, began to run when victim one directly reported the abuse to the police. Furthermore, defendant's prosecution for the two counts of risk of injury to a child were timely given the absence of persuasive evidence to support defendant's contention that the legislature intended &sect; 54-193a to be limited to crimes for which an express element of the offense was sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or sexual assault. As for the second issue, the record did not support a finding of an abuse of discretion in the trial court's finding that victim one's recollection of his abuse by defendant was not a product of hypnosis. Thus, defendant's motion to exclude victim one's testimony was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of conviction from the trial court (Connecticut), which convicted defendant of one count of criminal violation of a protective order, one count of reckless driving, and one count of attempt to escape or elude a police officer. Defendant also appealed from the judgment revoking his probation imposed on a previous conviction after a trial to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from an incident involving his ex-girlfriend, who had a protection order against defendant. Defendant had called 911 indicating his name and that he just shot his ex-girlfriend in the face. The police went to the ex-girlfriend's home to check on her and observed defendant in his vehicle less than 33 feet away from the home. Defendant attempted to elude police by driving away. Defendant never did shoot the ex-girlfriend. On appeal, the defendant challenged his conviction under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-223 on the ground that the State failed to proffer sufficient evidence for the jury to have found that he had violated the protective order. However, the court held that the mere intention to violate the order was sufficient to support a conviction under &sect; 53a-223. The court further found that the trial court properly enhanced defendant's sentence, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-40b, for violating Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-223(b), since no factual determination was required with regard to his probation revocation as the trial court properly took judicial notice of the same.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(a)(1). After the jury rendered its verdict, defendant filed a motion for judgment of acquittal, which the trial court denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's 12-year-old son was a victim of intense bullying at his school. School authorities and investigators had found the child's personal hygiene lacking. The child hung himself in defendant's apartment. The trial court denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal upon concluding that, although there was no evidence to support a finding that defendant's conduct was likely to cause physical injury to the child, the jury reasonably could have found that by maintaining a cluttered and unclean residence, defendant wilfully had caused her son to be placed in a situation that was likely to injure his mental health. The court held that &sect; 53-21(a)(1) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct. The court found that the trial court should have applied an objective standard in determining whether defendant had notice that her conduct fell within the scope of &sect; 53-21(a)(1) since, although defendant reasonably could have been aware that the conditions in her apartment were not optimal, the court was not persuaded that the nature and severity of the risk were such that defendant reasonably could not have believed that they were within the acceptable range.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to grant defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut), defendant was convicted of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-55a. He appealed directly to the present court under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-199(b)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not object to a charge that his flight could be used as circumstantial evidence of consciousness of guilt. The court held that the unpreserved claim was not of constitutional magnitude and thus could not be addressed on the merits. It rejected defendant's argument that the charge tended to undermine his self-defense claim. Evidence of flight after using deadly force did not logically compel a conclusion that the reason for the flight was self-defense. Next, it was misconduct for the prosecutor to say that it was &quot;fashionable of late to put the police department on trial.&quot; This remark, to which defendant had not objected, implied that criticizing the police investigation was a standard tactic used by defense counsel to divert a jury's attention from the &quot;real&quot; issues. This misconduct, however, did not deprive defendant of a fair trial. It was not frequent or severe; the State's case was strong enough to support a conclusion that an isolated instance of prosecutorial misconduct did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial; and the trial court's general instructions, which stated that arguments by counsel were not evidence, adequately addressed the improper remarks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut), denied intervention to movant institute, in a declaratory judgment action brought by plaintiffs, seven same sex couples (couples), against defendant department of health (department), challenging the constitutionality of Connecticut's marriage laws insofar as they precluded the issuance of marriage licenses to same sex couples.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The institute claimed that the trial court should have permitted it to intervene in the litigation either as a matter of right or permissively. The instant court disagreed. As to denial of intervention as a matter of right, the institute failed to identify an interest of direct and immediate character which would cause it to gain or lose anything as a result of the judgment in the present case. Second, it did not allege, much less demonstrate, that the judgment herein would affect any specific right or interest possessed by it or its members. All that it had established was its strong and capable commitment to championing a particular cause, which the trial court properly concluded was insufficient to require its intervention as a matter of right. As to its permissive intervention request, the trial court reasonably could have determined that the institute's interest in defending the constitutionality of the marriage laws would be adequately represented by the attorney general. Moreover, the present action was not one involving a multiplicity of divergent interests that needed to be represented separately because of different ways by which the merits might be resolved.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence that defendant's attorney was prejudiced in his ability to prepare for cross-examination of an officer by the attorney's absence at the probable cause hearing. The transcript of the probable cause hearing was available to and reviewed by the attorney prior to cross-examination of the officer. Officers possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion sufficient to justify a detention of defendant for investigative purposes under the Fourth Amendment, as the police had received an anonymous tip that specifically indicated that narcotics were being sold on that day in that location, which was a high trafficking area for narcotics. The police observed defendant standing in a group in the area identified by the caller as the location of the illegal drug sales.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70(a)(1), burglary in the first degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-101(a)(1), and sexual assault in the third degree in violation of Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first challenged the Appellate Court's conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the State to introduce evidence of a threatening telephone call to establish the identity of the victim's assailant (Conn. Code Evid. R. 4-5(b)). The appeals court agreed with defendant. Because there were no significant and compelling similarities between the charged and uncharged offenses and thus no evidence of a distinctive &quot;criminal logo,&quot; the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the State to introduce the evidence of the threatening telephone call. A lapse of three years between the charged and uncharged offenses could not be considered proximate in time. Improper admission of the uncharged misconduct evidence resulted in harmful error. A nonconstitutional error was harmless when an appellate court had a fair assurance that the error did not substantially affect the verdict. As the State's case was not particularly strong, the admission of the uncharged misconduct evidence was harmful because it suggested that defendant had a bad character and a propensity for criminal behavior, and thus improperly influenced the jurors' deliberations.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the applications and entered restraining orders against defendant, and defendant filed appeals of the orders. The appellate court dismissed the appeals as moot because the restraining orders had expired. The appellate court held that the expiration of a domestic violence restraining order did not render an appeal from that order moot because it was reasonably possible that there would be significant collateral consequences for the person subject to the order. The threat of reputation harm was particularly significant in this context because domestic violence restraining orders would not issue in the absence of the showing of a threat of violence, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-15(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mall claimed that the town's authorization of an agreement for the construction of a commercial project on land which housed various municipal buildings, issuance of bonds, and the conveyance of public land to the company were unlawful. On appeal, the mall contended that the trial court improperly imposed a heightened burden of proof as to taxpayer standing. The appellate court held that the trial court applied the proper standard by considering whether the mall demonstrated that its taxes would increase if the project were to proceed as planned and concluded that the mall failed to meet that burden. The mall's theory of standing was predicated on the notion that the mall was vindicating a right common to all taxpayers and consequently was relieved of its obligation to prove personal, special injury under the general standing rule. A majority of the town's voters twice approved by referendum the plans for the project. The appellate court held that the challenged actions of the town had been checked pursuant to a political process because the voters in essence ratified the action that the mall sought to have declared as unlawful on the taxpayers' behalf.</SPAN></P>

The state specifically challenged the Appellate Court's conclusion that the trial court improperly determined that the testimony of a key defense witness constituted an alibi, and abused its discretion in excluding the proffered testimony as a reasonable sanction for defendant's failure to satisfy the alibi notice provision of Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect;&nbsp;40-21. The supreme court agreed with the State, noting that the trial court properly characterized the subject testimony as an alibi for purposes of the notice provision of &sect;&nbsp;40-21. The supreme court further concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony as a sanction for noncompliance with the applicable rules of practice. Finally, the supreme court concluded that the testimony was not admissible under Conn. Code Evid.

Defendant argued that the police violated his Fourth Amendment rights by performing a patdown search. The appellate court found that the police had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant might have been armed and dangerous. The stop took place in a high crime area, and police observed defendant undertaking actions that appeared to be narcotics transactions. Immediately upon being stopped, defendant engaged in verbal resistance. The appellate court also held that the police did not exceed the scope of a permissible Terry stop by transporting defendant to a police substation. Defendant's resistance to the officers caused a large crowd to form to watch the action. This put the officer's safety at risk, and taking defendant to the substation was a reasonable action under the circumstances. Furthermore, the patdown search conducted at the substation while defendant was handcuffed did not exceed the scope of a justifiable search. The officers had only been able to frisk defendant's upper torso, and they still had a reasonable belief that defendant was armed.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court held that the authority for zoning in the city was governed by the language incorporated into its municipal charter and approved by the General Assembly by way of a special act, 1925 Conn. Spec. Acts 490. The state supreme court held that this special act provided the city with the necessary enabling authority for New Haven, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 65, which allowed the board of aldermen to divide the city into zones, and consequently gave the board the power to form a new zoning district when it granted the application. The state supreme court further held that the zoning regulation was not unconstitutionally vague. Thus, the board's decision was valid.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court held that the appellate court's analysis did not consider the effect of Conn. Gen.

The appellate court did not have the opportunity to consider the employee's statutory claims in the necessary context of the relevant collective bargaining agreement, which provided for superseniority for union stewards, the conflicting provisions of which had been approved properly by the legislature. Thus, because the facts alleged by the employee indicated that defendants acted consistently with the legislatively approved superseniority provision of the relevant collective bargaining agreement, defendants did not exceed their statutory authority, and they were entitled to sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a town zoning board, and intervening defendants, several complainants, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Middlesex (Connecticut), which sustained the appeal of plaintiff, an owner of multiple dogs, and reversed the board's decision to uphold a cease and desist order that required plaintiff to reduce the number of pet dogs on her property in accordance with the town's zoning regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was alleged to have at least 14 dogs on her residential property. The board received numerous complaints from neighbors, the complainants, with regard to the noise generated by prolonged barking, aggressive behavior toward a complainant and her family, and unattended dogs roaming on the neighboring properties. The town commission adopted a resolution allowing four dogs or less per household as a permissible accessory use. The trial court determined that pet dogs were not regulated as an accessory use under the town regulations, that setting an enforceable limit on the number of dogs kept in each residence was a substantive change to the town regulations that required notice, and that keeping over four pet dogs was a permissible use of property in the town's rural residential district. The court determined that the trial court misconstrued the town regulations as plain and unambiguous when, in fact, they were not. The court found that caselaw precedent and secondary sources on land use and zoning supported the conclusion that household pets such as dogs were subject to regulation as an accessory use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to dismiss plaintiff's appeal.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-39s.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1989 and 1990, the taxpayers filed capital gains, dividends, and interest income tax returns in Connecticut, reporting taxes due. They also filed Connecticut personal income tax returns for the years 1991 through 1993. In 1993, the State of New York performed a personal income tax audit on the taxpayers that resulted in paying the State of New York $ 2.4 million to settle their tax liabilities as New York residents. The taxpayers then filed amended Connecticut tax returns and claims for refunds of capital gains, dividends, and interest income taxes paid from 1989 through 1993, contending that, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-505, they were not Connecticut residents for that time period and, accordingly, were not subject to Connecticut taxation. The court determined that the trial court properly concluded that refunds under &sect; 12-39s were committed to the commissioner's sole discretion. The court also held that the trial court was without jurisdiction to evaluate the merits of the taxpayers' claim for a refund under &sect; 12-39s since the three-year statute of limitations period contained in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;12-515 had expired.</SPAN></P>

The board refused to warn a meeting. The residents sought a writ of mandamus to compel the board to warn a town meeting pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-1(a). The lower appellate court reasoned that under &sect; 7-1, the board was not required to warn a special town meeting as the meeting's purpose to eliminate the town planner position was improper because the board solely was responsible for hiring and firing town employees. The supreme court held the purpose of the meeting was not to fire an employee, but rather to eliminate a town position. The board had authority to create or eliminate the town planner position. The elimination of the position of town planner was a proper purpose for the town meeting. Since that purpose was proper, the board was required to warn a special town meeting under &sect; 7-1. Finally, the proposed legislation was not an unconstitutional bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party was hurt by an underinsured motorist while driving his employer's vehicle, which was insured under a commercial fleet policy. The employer had elected underinsured motorist coverage less than that statutorily provided, but a statutorily required notice in the election form was not in 12-point type, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-336(a)(2), so an arbitrator and the trial court found the election invalid. The supreme court held, in analyzing the application of &sect; 38a-336(a)(2) to a commercial fleet policy, it could not be determined from the text of the statute if the legislature intended its typeface requirements to strictly apply to commercial fleet policies, so, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-2z, extratextual evidence could be considered. This evidence showed a company insuring a fleet of vehicles to carry on a large commercial enterprise did not fall within the class of consumers the legislature sought to protect in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-336(a)(2), so there was no reason to require strict adherence to the requirement of a notice in 12-point type in the context of a commercial fleet policy, and the employer's election of reduced coverage was not invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that toxic substances in the workplace had caused the decedents' deaths from chemical poisoning and cancer. The motion to strike asserted that the action was untimely because it was brought on behalf of decedents who either had died more than two years before the action was filed or had ceased working for the employers more than five years before the action was filed. The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-577c(b), the statute of limitations for personal injury or property damage caused by toxic substances, did not preempt Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-555. In addition, &sect; 52-555 was not preempted by 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 9658(a)(1), which specified the applicable limitations period for actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 9601 et seq. Toxic exposure solely within a workplace was excluded from CERCLA's definition of the term &quot;release,&quot; as provided in &sect; 9601(22).

It was not unfairly prejudicial as it did not arouse the fact finder's emotions, created no side issue, did not consume undue time, and the acquittee anticipated it. Admitting it did not violate his right to confrontation because that right did not apply to these civil proceedings. Its admission did not deprive him of a meaningful opportunity to be heard, as the procedures used adequately protected his liberty interest. Counsel represented him before the Psychiatric Security Review Board and he could have presented evidence there. He could have cross-examined all witnesses there and presented his own expert at state expense. The report was not subject to deferential review. The acquittee was free to rebut it.

Prof. Conduct 8.2(a), barring an attorney's statements critical of a judge's qualifications, was not clearly erroneous, because the attorney's accusations were wholly conclusory. His letter, his testimony, and other documentary evidence showed a knowing or reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of his statements. Rule 8.2(a) applied to him personally, as it did not indicate it was not so intended. Given his disregard for his statements' truth or falsity, the First Amendment did not protect them. They eroded public confidence in the judiciary, undermining the administration of justice, so his violation of Rule 8.2(a) showed he violated Conn. R. Prof. Conduct 8.4(4), barring conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Rule 8.4(4) did not say it was not intended to apply to attorneys personally.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the administrator of the estate of a deceased police officer, appealed the decision of the Judicial District of Tolland, Complex Litigation Docket (Connecticut), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, a town, its police chief, and various dispatch employees. The administrator brought a wrongful death suit, asserting that the police department employees provided inadequate and misleading information to the decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was fatally shot when he unexpectedly encountered a home robbery in progress after having been dispatched to response to a 911 check welfare call. The administrator had asserted negligence claims as well as substantive violations of the federal constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and the Connecticut Constitution. At trial, the administrator conceded that the workers' compensation exclusivity provision barred the negligence counts. The trial court granted defendants summary judgment upon concluding that there was no wilful misconduct and that no reasonable person could have concluded that defendants acted with the intent to expose the decedent to deadly force. On appeal, the administrator challenged the trial court's judgment only with respect to his asserted substantive due process claims under both the federal and state constitutions. The court acknowledged its adoption of the state created danger theory of liability but that the administrator failed to prove that the harm inflicted by the shooter, a private actor, was in any way attributable to defendant nor that defendants' conduct met the conscience shocking degree of culpability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Britain (Connecticut), which convicted him of two counts of attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree, two counts of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child by sexual contact, three counts of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child, one count of attempt to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity, and pornography and obscenity crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from an Internet undercover operation wherein a police officer posed as a 13-year-old girl online. The online profile for the purported victim clearly indicated that she was 13 years of age and instant messages between defendant and the victim also confirmed that defendant knew her age. Approximately 20 to 30 online conversations were engaged in wherein defendant was very explicit as to what sexual acts he wanted from the victim. Two meetings were set up, with defendant apprehended at the second one. Defendant contended on appeal that the attempt to commit sexual assault, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-71(a)(1) and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-49(a)(2) (2001), and attempt to commit risk of injury to a child, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21 (Rev. to 1999) and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-49(a)(1) (2001), were not cognizable crimes since they were strict liability crimes. The court disagreed and held that neither crime was a specific intent crime since each was a general intent crime. Therefore, it was enough that the State proved that defendant intended to have sexual intercourse with the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from the killing of a man, along with the assistance of a co-defendant, who had sought to purchase drugs from defendant. Prior to trial, defendant had moved to suppress written and oral statements obtained by the police based upon the argument that his right to counsel had attached at the State's signing of the information. Defendant also sought to suppress a prior inconsistent statement of a third party, namely a former co-worker of defendant who had provided the police with a seven page written statement describing incriminating statements made by co-defendant in his presence. The trial court denied defendant's motion. The court upheld that denial finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the co-worker's prior inconsistent statement into evidence as the co-worker had claimed no memory of any incriminating statements made by co-defendant, which were squarely against co-defendant's penal interest and were, therefore, sufficiently trustworthy to have been admitted as an exception to the rule against hearsay. Defendant's right to counsel did not attach until the information was filed, which was at his arraignment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1975, the fifteen-year-old victim was found bludgeoned to death in a wooded area on the grounds near her family home. No one was charged in connection with her murder until twenty-five years later, when defendant, a fifteen-year-old neighbor of the victim at the time of her death, was arrested and charged with the crime. Among other rulings, the supreme court rejected defendant's claim that the juvenile court improperly transferred his case to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court. In addition, the State's prosecution of defendant for the murder was not time barred by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-193. As the five-year limitation period of the pre-amendment version of &sect; 54-193 had not expired with respect to the October, 1975 murder when a 1976 amendment to that statutory provision became effective, 1976 Conn. Acts 35, &sect; 1 was the operative statute of limitations. Because &sect; 1 applied and excluded all Class A felonies, including murder, from its five-year limitation period, the State's prosecution of defendant was not time barred. The court rejected its holding in Paradise that the canon of strict construction required the conclusion that &sect; 1 had prospective effect only.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The groundwater under the owners' property was contaminated by leakage from a landfill operated by the city. The owners argued that the proper method of calculating damages for the inverse condemnation of the property was comparing the value of the land in its uncontaminated state to the value of the land in its contaminated state, and awarding the difference in monetary damages. The state supreme court held that the trial court properly rejected this measure because a federal court in an earlier action had rejected that proposed measure of damages, and thus the claim was barred by collateral estoppel. The federal court concluded that the contamination of the property was a result of the city's negligence and granted relief designed to restore the owners to the position that they would have been in had the contamination never occurred. This included injunctive relief which required the city to provide the owners with a potable water source and to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the owners and subsequent owners against any claims of environmental liability. Thus, the appellate court held that owners' claims for monetary damages were barred by collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant as a third offender on the basis of two prior convictions in New York for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192 (1996). Defendant did not check the box indicating that his plea was conditional. Defendant claimed that he did not intend to admit that the elements of the New York offenses were substantially similar to the elements of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a(g). The Supreme Court held that because the information set forth the statutory name of the crime, it was constitutionally sufficient. Defendant did not move to withdraw his plea. Therefore, his claim was not preserved for appellate review. Because the trial court never denied a motion to dismiss or a motion to suppress, there was no appealable issue under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-94a. Therefore, the lower appellate court correctly refused to apply Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-94a in order to review the merits of defendant's claim. The lower appellate court properly concluded that defendant waived his right to challenge the trial court's determination that he was a third offender pursuant to Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Court (Connecticut) reversed a decision of the trial court granting intervenor newspaper company's motion to vacate protective orders (later joined by other intervenor newspaper companies) and the court's subsequent orders concerning the disclosure of sealed and protected materials. The court granted the companies' petitions for certification to appeal and set forth four revised certified questions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose from lawsuits alleging sexual abuse of minors by clergymen employed by the Roman Catholic Church. Protective orders were issued with respect to certain documents and information. Prior to trial, all of the lawsuits were settled and withdrawn. One company later moved to intervene and sought to vacate the orders sealing the documents. The appellate court held that because the cases had been withdrawn more than one year prior to the company's request, the trial court's actions were precluded by the four-month limitation period of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-212a. The supreme court concluded that the trial court retained continuing jurisdiction over the withdrawn cases insofar as the documents filed under seal in those cases were concerned, and just as a court had continuing jurisdiction to vacate or to modify an injunction after the four-month limitation period expired, so too did a court have continuing jurisdiction to vacate or to modify a protective order after the expiration of that limitation period. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket. The companies had a strong interest in challenging the protective orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded (1) to affirm the trial court's decision effectively restoring the withdrawn cases to the docket and granting the companies intervenor status; (2) to vacate the orders issued in connection with the trial court's decision of May 8, 2002; and (3) to remand the case for a de novo determination of the merits of one company's request to unseal court files in the withdrawn cases.</SPAN></P>

When the police took defendant to the station for questioning, his mother refused to grant consent to search the house, but his father granted consent. During the search, the police found defendant's clothes, which were stained with the victim's blood. Defendant then confessed to the crime. On appeal, defendant argued that because his mother declined to consent to the search of his home, the search was illegal and the evidence found pursuant to the search improperly was admitted into evidence by the trial court. The state supreme court held that under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, when joint occupants had equal control over the premises, and both were present when consent to the search was sought, both joint occupants had to give their consent in order for the ensuing search to be valid pursuant to the consent exception.

XXX.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had revised its application of the rule of three, a traditional civil service rule that gave managers discretion to choose among the top three candidates for promotion, to allow police department officials to consider more than three candidates in the event of tie scores on promotional examinations. Another change in practice, rounding exam scores, resulted in larger tied groups, and in the placement of some candidates, including the officers who were plaintiffs, in pools with lower priority than would have been their positions under the old system. Although there were too many unresolved issues in the trial court's rulings in two of the three consolidated cases, in one case, the ruling invalidating the rounding practice had resolved all the outstanding issues in that case, so the court reviewed that ruling, providing an interpretation that would also govern later trial proceedings in the other two matters. The civil service rules in art. XXX were to apply strictly, because the whole point of civil service legislation was to limit managerial discretion. Practices that resulted in promotional pools with 45 candidates were subversive of that legislative intent.</SPAN></P>

Testimony on the victim's statements that she feared defendant fell under the state of mind exception in Conn. Code Evid. R. 8-3(4) and defendant's romantic relationship with the victim made her state of mind relevant to motive and to question a defense theory that someone else killed the victim. The exception was firmly rooted, so admissibility was proper under the Confrontation Clause of U.S. Const. amend. VI. Since defendant did not preserve his challenges to the jury charges, the court was limited to constitutional, plain error, and supervisory authority review.

The court affirmed, holding that the constable was not a regular member of a paid municipal police department.

Stat. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;7-294a and 7-277a, to determine that Connecticut differentiated between sworn members of organized local police departments and constables. The fact that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-433c did not expressly reference constables was dispositive of the court's finding that &sect; 7-433c did not generally apply to them. The court also concluded that the town the constable worked for did not have a paid municipal police department. The town's ordinances vested the authority to appoint constables in the town board of selectmen, not the police commission required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-724 for establishing a police department. Also, the town had contracted for a resident state trooper, an action that could only be taken by towns without regular police departments.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted a motion by respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, to dismiss. The Appellate Court (Connecticut) reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Commissioner, on the granting of certification, appealed to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner argued that the appellate court erred in ruling that the prisoner was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the habeas corpus petition. The state supreme court concluded that the prisoner adequately pled ineffective assistance of counsel and, therefore, that the appellate court properly remanded for an evidentiary hearing. The prisoner alleged in his petition that his right to a jury trial in the underlying action was violated when the state supreme court ordered the trial court to modify the judgment to reflect a conviction of manslaughter because the jury never had considered whether he had the state of mind required for manslaughter. He then alleged in the reply that the ineffective assistance of his counsel excused his failure to raise the issue during the appeal or to challenge the decision after it was made. In other words, he claimed that the ineffective assistance of counsel constituted cause and prejudice permitting review of his claim despite the claimed procedural default, a claim that properly was raised by way of a reply. However, the state supreme court held that the appellate court improperly determined that the petition was not successive.</SPAN></P>

After serving the sentence, the prisoner pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter. In the habeas corpus petition, the prisoner argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the proceedings on the assault charge and that the assault conviction was used to enhance the sentence on the manslaughter charge. The trial court dismissed the motion on grounds that it lacked jurisdiction because the prisoner had already served the sentence. The prisoner argued that the collateral consequences of the assault conviction were sufficient to render him in custody within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-466. The state supreme court held that a petitioner whose conviction had expired fully prior to the filing of a habeas corpus petition was not in &quot;custody&quot; on that conviction, despite the alleged existence of collateral consequences flowing from that conviction. Although the custody requirement had been construed liberally, it had never been extended to the situation where a habeas petitioner suffered no present restraint from a conviction.</SPAN></P>

He also indicated that he and another man had stabbed the victim and that &quot;they&quot; had taken the body behind a building before moving it to the woods. Towards the end of defendant's murder trial, the State indicated that it had discovered a police report containing information gathered from a confidential informant that defendant's accomplice had bragged about killing the victim. Defendant unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial on the ground that the report constituted exculpatory evidence within the meaning of Brady. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the State's untimely disclosure did not violate defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial or to due process because the trial court granted a continuance to allow him to review the materials and to attempt to locate the accomplice.

In light of Connecticut's express statutory scheme, the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss with regard to the contract claim. The property owner's takings claim was similarly unavailing because the State's failure to pay the full amount of rent allegedly due was not, as a matter of law, a taking.

The taxpayers asserted that the only way in which that alleged unconstitutionality was subject to remedy was to make the regional school district into a single taxing district for the purposes of education, with a uniform mill rate. The trial court had determined that the taxpayers' suit asserted a political question and, therefore, the taxpayers lacked standing. The court agreed and upheld the dismissal.

Accordingly, to establish the unconstitutionality of the statute as applied to him, it was incumbent on defendant to present a factual record demonstrating how the statute was in fact applied to him. The state supreme court concluded that the trial court improperly granted defendant's motion to dismiss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a condition of defendant's release on charges of assaulting his girlfriend's sister, a protective order was issued under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-38c (1999) that barred him from contacting the sister or entering an apartment where she sometimes resided but which was also the apartment he shared with the girlfriend. He violated that order and was charged with CVPO. At trial, defendant was precluded from introducing evidence that the sister was not a member of his household and did not qualify for the protective order that was issued. On appeal of his conviction, defendant claimed that he was deprived of his U.S. Const. amend. VI and XIV right to present a defense, that the State was required to prove the validity of the order, and that his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to counsel was deprived at the protective order hearing. The court found that the collateral bar rule prevented defendant from attacking the validity of the protective order at his CVPO trial and that validity of the order was not an element of CVPO. His challenge based on the lack of counsel at the protective order hearing was also an impermissible collateral attack on that order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certification to an appeal by the State from a judgment of the Appellate Court of Connecticut that set aside convictions on three of five counts on which defendant had been convicted in connection with misconduct with his granddaughters. The convictions that were set aside on grounds of insufficiency of evidence involved charges of risk of injury to a child under the &quot;act&quot; prong of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53.21(1) (Rev. to 1997).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that while &sect; 53.21 had been amended several times in preceding years, none of the changes affected the gloss that its case law had placed on &sect; 53.21(1)'s proscription of acts creating a risk of injury to a child, so that to avoid unconstitutional vagueness, that proscription had to be read as involving some sort of acts of physical touching. While the conduct involved in the three counts that had been reversed was reprehensible, there was no physical contact with the victims, so prosecution under that theory failed. At trial, one of the victims mentioned another incident that had involved physical contact, but the State had not known about that incident before, so that it was not part of its theory of the case. It would have violated defendant's due process rights to allow the State to change its theory liability on appeal, so the evidence relied on at trial had to be sufficient to support conviction under the &quot;act&quot; prong, as opposed to the &quot;situation&quot; prong of that subsection, and there could be no reliance on evidence that had not been the focus of the State's case at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff children's federal action for civil rights damages from defendant Commissioner of the Department of Children and Families, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit certified two questions of law regarding the scope of the commissioner's obligation under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-101g(c) to remove the children from their home after finding probable cause to believe they were under an imminent risk of physical harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children brought an action in federal court against the commissioner due to the failure to remove them from their home though there was probable cause to believe their stepfather was being physically abusive. Procedural due process claims were dismissed by the federal district court and an interlocutory appeal of that order was allowed. The federal appellate court certified two questions. The first was whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-101g(c) required the commissioner to remove the children if probable cause existed to believe they were in imminent risk of physical harm. The second was, if the commissioner authorized removal, whether the commissioner's designated employees were required, or merely authorized, to remove the children. The court held that despite the use of the word &quot;shall&quot; in &sect; 17a-101g(c), the statute granted the commissioner discretionary authority to remove the children, along with a host of other options. Removal was not mandated. Moreover, even if the commissioner authorized removal under &sect; 17a-101g(c), Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 17a-101-13(b) allowed the designated employees discretion on whether to remove the children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered both certified questions in the negative, holding that the commissioner had discretionary authority, and was not mandated, to remove the children and that even if the commissioner authorized removal, the designated employees or law enforcement personnel were not statutorily required to remove the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant exhausted his appellate process for a death sentence, including the mandatory review provided by Conn.

The PD and the next friend sought next friend status to pursue postconviction relief on his behalf, including participation in an ongoing consolidated habeas litigation based on racial bias that was filed for other defendants who were sentenced to death. The habeas court dismissed the petitions and the court dismissed their writs of error, finding that they lacked standing. Petitions to stay defendant's execution pending the consolidated habeas litigation thereby became moot. The court determined that, while &sect; 53a-46b required review of defendant's sentence, the statute did not create a non-waivable right to review of any postconviction claims, regardless of when and by whom the claim was raised. During the entire 20 years of defendant's litigation, he never claimed that his death sentence was the product of systemic racial bias and he expressly stated that he did not wish to participate in the consolidated litigation. Defendant's waiver of those issues prevented the PD and the next friend from obtaining standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders dismissing the PD's and the next friend's petitions for writs of habeas corpus on behalf of defendant and, therefore, dismissed their writs of error challenging those dismissal orders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's retrospective application of the court's decision in Roth was proper. Roth applied equally irrespective of whether a grandparent moved to secure an initial order of visitation or a parent moved to modify such an order, and the grandparents' failure to satisfy the Roth standards mandated termination of the visitation order. Because the grandparents were not the child's legal guardians, and the child's interests were represented by an attorney, the grandparents could not assert the child's legal rights. The trial court was compelled to grant the motion to terminate visitation. The grandparents failed to allege or attempt to prove that their relationship with the child was similar to a parent-child relationship and denial of visitation would cause real and significant harm to the child. Without those specific, good faith allegations or such proof, the trial court's prior order of visitation was rendered without subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the mother's motion to modify and terminate the grandparents' visitation rights properly was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, a two-year-old child, was beaten to death. Defendant, the boyfriend of the victim's mother, was convicted of murder and capital murder, and was sentenced to death. Defendant challenged the conviction and the sentence raising numerous points of alleged error. The court noted that the pervasive standard of review with regard to all of defendant's points of error was whether the trial court abused its discretion. The court concluded that under all the circumstances the trial court did not abuse its discretion in any ruling made during the trial process. However, with regard to the penalty phase of the trial, the court found reversible error. The court held that the jury instructions given in the penalty phase, namely that the jury must be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factor or factors outweighed the mitigating factor or factors and that, therefore, it was persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that death was the appropriate punishment, did not conform to the judicial system's rigid standards. Accordingly, reversal of the sentence was mandated. The conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The car company appealed the determination by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New London (Connecticut) which denied the application to correct the award.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer purchased a vehicle which experienced several serious problems with its first 24,000 miles of operation, including noise from the muffler and a banging noise from the transmission. As a result, the buyer had the vehicle serviced on eight separate occasions during its first 24,000 miles of operation, rendering it unusable for a total of approximately 35 days.  The repairs included replacing the transmission, readjusting the rear hatch, and replacing the air conditioning system. After the vehicle surpassed the 24,000 mile mark, the buyer experienced further problems, including gas seeping into the passenger compartment and continued banging in the transmission. The arbitration panel found the buyer was entitled to relief under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-179 et seq., and ordered the car company to accept return of the buyer's defective vehicle and furnish her with a new vehicle. The appellate court held there was substantial evidence in the record of the arbitration proceeding to support the panel's finding that the replacement vehicle awarded was comparable to the buyer's original vehicle where there was no exact replacement. Thus, the trial court properly upheld the award.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with defendant that the issue of whether the victims were less than 10 years of age should have been submitted to the jury. However, the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court upon determining that the absence of such a jury finding was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in the case. The court found that it was beyond a reasonable doubt that the victims were less than 10 years of age and their age was never contested by defendant. The fact that there was overwhelming evidence of the victims' age, coupled with defendant's failure to contest the issue at any time, made the trial court's error harmless.</SPAN></P>

Witnesses testified defendant did not appear to be intoxicated. Defendant's motion for acquittal was denied. Defendant then presented a witness who testified that defendant had told him that he had consumed one and one-half beers and three glasses of scotch on the evening of the accident. The appellate court concluded that the waiver rule was not unconstitutional and it saw no persuasive reason not to apply it in defendant's case. On the basis of all of the evidence presented to the jury, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction. The waiver rule simply was one of a myriad of considerations that defendant had to take into account when planning his defense. Although defendant's statements regarding his desire to be taken back to the accident site fell within the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, they were not improperly excluded by the trial court because they were irrelevant to the charge of evading responsibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice action by plaintiff patient against defendant, apportionment plaintiff radiologists, the court transferred to itself from the Connecticut Appellate Court an appeal by apportionment defendants, a state employee, the State, and its claims commissioner (collectively, the State), from orders that denied the State's motion to dismiss and issued a writ of mandamus compelling the commissioner to allow such a complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged that the radiologists negligently failed to detect his lung cancer and the radiologists in turn argued that certain state employees' negligence was largely to blame, and they filed a complaint for apportionment of liability under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-102b. Since the State had not legislatively waived immunity in medical malpractice actions, they sought a waiver of sovereign immunity from the claims commissioner under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-160, and then one of the state employees further sought such a waiver to allow him to seek apportionment of liability against the State directly. While the matter was pending, the State's highest court decided that &sect; 4-160 allowed the commissioner to authorize only suits seeking monetary awards, not apportionments of liability. In light of that decision, the commissioner clearly lacked jurisdiction to authorize the apportionment actions against the State and its employees as well. Therefore, none of the relief sought in the trial court should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the matter to that court with directions to deny requests for declaratory and mandamus relief and to grant the State's motions to dismiss the apportionment complaints.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a motion in limine requesting that the trial court prohibit defendant from presenting evidence that the victim had engaged in prostitution, without a prior judicial ruling on the admissibility of such evidence. Defendant claimed that the trial court deprived him of his constitutional rights to confront witnesses against him and to present a defense by precluding him from questioning the victim about her prior history of prostitution. The State claimed that this evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial to the State's case. The State also claimed that the introduction of that evidence would violate Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-86f, the rape shield statute. Because the primary issue was whether the sexual intercourse was consensual, any evidence that was so relevant and material to the issue of consent that excluding it would have violated defendant's constitutional rights was admissible under &sect; 54-86f (4). Further, defendant's knowledge of her prostitution on prior occasions was sufficiently relevant to the issue of consent, in that it supported defendant's claim that the victim consented to the sexual intercourse and suggested a motive for the victim to testify falsely.</SPAN></P>

Initially, as part of the application process, the water pollution control authority voted to deny the sewer connections on the ground that 55 of the residences with septic systems were located within the sewer service area and, if any of the septic systems failed, connection to the sewer system would be required. Additionally, the commission was entitled to consider whether the more intense use of the land proposed by the owners created a risk to the public health that otherwise would not have existed. However, evidence of a mere possibility of harm did not constitute sufficient evidence that a substantial public interest was threatened for purposes of &sect; 8-30g(g). Accordingly, the zoning commission did not meet its burden under the first prong of &sect; 8-30g(g). As such, that portion of the decision was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed only to the extent that it sustained the owners' appeal from the commission's denial of the site plan application. The case was remanded with directions to dismiss that portion of the owners' appeal. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student filed a racial discrimination complaint with the commission, but a presiding referee granted the board's motion to dismiss.

It sustained the commission's appeal alleging that it had jurisdiction over the student's complaint and the case was remanded to the commission. The commission challenged dismissal as to the student. The board claimed that the state education board had exclusive administrative jurisdiction over discrimination complaints in the public schools and that the remand meant no appeal was available. The court found that: (1) the remand was a final judgment under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183(j) for purposes of appeal; (2) the student's appeal was not moot because the commission could grant compensatory damages under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-86(c) as a remedy for discrimination; (3) the commission's authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-58(a) allowed it to correct discrimination claims in public schools under Conn.

Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court improperly denied his motion to exclude identifications and denied his motion to dismiss the charges of murder and capital felony. Defendant also argued the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A witness testified that another individual wished to kill the victims, a little boy and his mother, as the individual thought the boy was a witness to an attempted murder. The witness saw defendant walking back and forth in front of the victims' house. The witness was asked to help the shooter gain entrance to the victims' house. Defendant sat in a car as the shooter entered the house and killed the victims. Defendant threatened to kill the witness if she talked to anyone about the murder. The appellate court held the witness's identifications were reliable under the totality of the circumstances. The jury reasonably could have inferred that, at the time of the murders, defendant was scoping out the area for witnesses, that he knew the shooter's purpose was to kill the victims, and that he facilitated the shooter's escape. The evidence supporting the murder charges supported the conviction for conspiracy to commit murder. Because defendant had not previously been tried for the offenses, the Double Jeopardy Clause was not implicated. The extent of defendant's participation was not so attenuated that it was unjust to hold him responsible for the conduct of his coconspirator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a union, filed an action to enjoin defendants, the owner and manager of a shopping mall, from denying access to the common areas of a shopping mall to distribute literature and to address mall patrons regarding employees' legal rights. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Britain (Connecticut), entered judgment in favor of defendants. The union appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

I,, &sect;&sect; 4 and 5, and its right to freedom of assembly under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The trial court determined that the mall was a private actor, and therefore, not subject to the guarantees afforded by the state constitution. The appellate court agreed that there was inadequate state action to trigger state constitutional protection. Nothing in the record suggested that the involvement of state agencies in the construction of the mall was unusual or extensive, particularly for a large commercial property. Neither the mall nor any other commercial business in the community was billed for general police patrol services, unless it is was a specific request for an extra duty job. Likewise, the state fire code applied to all municipalities within the state. An area set aside for police use at the mall did not constitute a police substation. There was no exclusive permanent police presence. Instead, officers were assigned to the mall as part of a patrol zone. There was also no evidence that the city paid for any of the improvements to the land.</SPAN></P>

The state's highest court held that the mother's challenge failed as the constitutional protection afforded parents applied to fit parents. Further, the record supported the trial court's finding that the commissioner had proved by clear and convincing evidence that the mother had failed to attain a degree of rehabilitation sufficient to warrant the belief that, at some time in the foreseeable future, she would be capable of assuming a responsible position with respect to her child's care. There was ample evidence of the mother's documented struggle with drug abuse, inability to secure and maintain adequate employment and income, inability to live independently and inexplicable absences from scheduled visits to see her son. The record was sufficient to support the trial court's finding without testimony from an expert. Finally, the trial court did not improperly conclude that clear and convincing evidence established that it was in the child's best interest to terminate the mother's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not obtain a permit for the handgun. Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information, claiming that, although he had possessed a handgun without a permit as alleged, he had done so while operating a taxicab in which he had a proprietary interest, and, therefore, his possession of the handgun without a permit was not prohibited. Specifically, defendant argued that his possession met the &quot;place of business&quot; exception under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-35(a). In opposing defendant's motion to dismiss, the State claimed that a taxicab was not a place of business within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-35 (a). In analyzing the statute, the legislature merely intended for a taxicab driver, like any other person whose business may have relied on a motor vehicle, to obtain a permit to carry a handgun before bringing it into his or her vehicle. However, such an exemption mandated an application for a permit, which defendant did not do. Finally, such an interpretation and requirement for a permit constituted sound public policy.</SPAN></P>

The city contended that it was entitled to reimbursement from the fund under &sect; 31-306(a)(2)(A). Affirming the board's decision, the court held that the fund was not required to reimburse a municipal employer, like the city, for COLAs paid in connection with a claim under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-433c. Although the Workers' Compensation Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-275 et seq., was used as a procedural avenue for administration of Conn. Gen.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 7-433c and 31-306(a)(2)(A) were a rational means to further a legitimate legislative purpose and, accordingly, satisfied the requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the officer of the governor, moved to quash a subpoena to compel the governor to testify before defendant, a select committee, and to enjoin the committee from enforcing the subpoena and to declare the enforcement of the subpoena unconstitutional. The Superior Court, Judicial District of Hartford (Connecticut), denied the committee's motion to dismiss and denied the motion to quash. The office of the governor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The committee was investigating whether grounds existed to impeach the governor. The principal issue on appeal was whether the office of the governor was categorically immune, by virtue of Conn. Const. art. II, the separation of powers provision, from a subpoena issued by the select committee pursuant to Conn. Const. art. IX to compel the governor to testify. The state supreme court rejected the committee's jurisdictional claims, and concluded that the governor was not categorically immune from compelled testimony by this subpoena, and that the subpoena was not inconsistent with the separation of powers provision of the state constitution. The state supreme court therefore concluded that the trial court properly denied the motion by the office of the governor to quash the subpoena and for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff governor's office appealed from orders of the Superior Court, Judicial District of Hartford (Connecticut), that denied its motions, based primarily on separation of powers, to quash a subpoena issued by defendant select committee of the legislature to compel the governor to testify in proceedings before the committee as it considered whether to recommend impeachment and for injunctive relief against the enforcement of the subpoena.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the governor had resigned and the committee had disbanded after issuance of the high court's earlier summary decision, it nonetheless issued a complete opinion articulating its reasoning. First, the committee was not correct in arguing that separation of powers, under Conn. Const. art. II, as amended by Conn. Const. amend. art. XVIII, or justiciability principles prevented courts from exercising review in matters involving impeachment. Connecticut law had always allowed review of certain issues arising in impeachment settings, and since a governor, unlike other officials, faced at least temporary removal from office as soon as impeachment articles were filed, it was critical to allow review in any case where a colorable claim of constitutional violations was made. Separation of powers also, however, failed to protect the governor from the duty to comply with the efforts by the committee, primarily responsible for the initial stages of an impeachment, to carry out its constitutional duties. Federal constitutional case law suggesting that a president might be immune from judicial process in certain situations was not apt, because it did not arise in an impeachment setting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress the videotapes that formed the basis for the charges against him because, inter alia, the search warrant affidavit was based on information supplied by an employee of defendant's employer who had been monitoring defendant's computer use and who defendant alleged was acting as an agent of the police. The supreme court held that the evidence sufficiently supported the trial court's finding that the employee was in no way acting as an agent of the government; the police did not seek out the employee and were not involved in his decision to obtain information regarding defendant. Defendant also claimed that the trial court violated his right to counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, by denying his motion for a continuance to change counsel prior to the suppression hearing. The supreme court concluded that this claim was not reviewable because it neither fell within the narrow scope of Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner brought a complaint charging the company with flagrant and persistent violations of statutes for operating solid waste disposal areas without a permit. An order for enforcement of the parties' consent order was sought. The company was assessed a very large civil penalty in accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22a-226a, -438(a). The company appealed, arguing that an order requiring compliance with the consent order violated constitutionally protected due process rights for vagueness and the amount owed was improperly determined because fact-finding was not properly performed.. The court found, first, that there were no internal inconsistencies in the trial court's judgment, so the due process claim failed. The court also rejected the company's argument that the definition of &quot;solid waste&quot; in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-207(3) was unconstitutionally vague so that the company therefore did not have notice as to which waste operations required permits. Finally, the trial court made findings, properly weighed the evidence, and specifically discredited the company's arguments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury had evidence from which it could unanimously find (1) the aggravator that defendant's kidnapping, raping, and strangulation murders of four women were each done in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner--inflicting physical or psychological pain or suffering, or both, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and (2) no culpability statutory or non-statutory mitigator, proven by a preponderance of the evidence, and the jury recommended death. The jury members each had to find a mitigator, although not necessarily the same one, for the jury to have unanimously found a mitigator requiring the trial court to impose a life sentence, but no jury member found that defendant proved even one mitigator to possibly have obtained a mistrial. Even assuming defendant was in fact a sexual sadist, there was substantial evidence (1) that he was competent to stand trial, to understand the proceedings, and to assist counsel, and (2) that he was not so mentally impaired, under the Conn.

In its self-defense charge, the trial court included the exact language that defendant had requested. After the court excused the jury to begin its deliberations, the court asked counsel if there were any objections to the jury charge. Defense counsel indicated that he had no objection. By affirmatively requesting language of deadly force to the exclusion of language of non-deadly force, defendant induced the claimed error. As such, defendant failed to satisfy the third prong of Golding because he has failed to establish that a constitutional violation clearly existed and clearly deprived him of a fair trial because the challenged jury instruction repeated the exact language that the defendant had requested.</SPAN></P>

The Hartford, Connecticut, Superior Court granted the State's motion to dismiss based on the suit being untimely under &sect; 4-148 and 1996 Conn. Acts 16 (Spec. Sess.) being an unconstitutional exclusive public emolument under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The executor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died at a hospital owned and operated by the State in 1992 from complications involving an aneurysm that grew in size and ruptured. The suit alleged negligence. The executor had been first informed that the State's medical treatment was proper, and then later learned from a specialist that there might have been malpractice. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148 provided a time limit for a suit against the State, which the highest court redefined in detail. Generally, the Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4-148(a), 52-584 limitation period for actions in negligence began to run on the date when the injury was first discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered. The term &quot;injury&quot; was synonymous with &quot;legal injury&quot; or &quot;actionable harm.&quot; &quot;Actionable harm&quot; occurred when the executor discovered, or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered the &quot;essential elements&quot; of a cause of action. After defining the remainder of the test, the highest court decided the executor pleaded discovery sufficiently to survive a motion to dismiss. As the suit was not untimely as a matter of law, 1996 Conn. Acts 16 (Spec. Sess.) did not violate Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The highest court decided that (1) the executor's suit was not untimely as a matter of law under the limitations statutes for suits against the State, (2) the special act was not an unconstitutional public emolument, and (3) the motion to dismiss was not to be granted, and reversed the judgment and remanded the suit for further proceedings, which included to determine if, in fact, the suit was timely based on discovery of a legal injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that the parents failed to achieve sufficient rehabilitation, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-112(j)(3)(B)(ii), and, accordingly, granted the petition. In doing so, however, the trial court expressly drew an adverse inference against the parents for their failure to testify at the termination proceeding. The supreme court found the evidence credited by the trial court adequately supported its conclusion that the parents failed to achieve sufficient rehabilitation. There was adequate evidence on which the trial court could have concluded the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family. Because Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 34-1(f) (2001) (repealed and replaced by Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 32a-1(e)) was designed to implement its statutory counterparts, it did not prohibit an adverse inference from being drawn against the parents. However, the trial court was required to give them prior notice of its intent to draw such an inference.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court (Connecticut) granted defendant's motion to dismiss the State's petition for recommitment based on its conclusion that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593(c) was unconstitutional. Rather than pursue a civil commitment, the State appealed from the trial court's judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court (Connecticut). The state supreme court granted the State's motion to transfer the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593(c), which governed the recommitment of insanity acquittees. The statute permitted a court to extend the commitment of an acquittee past his initial term of commitment if his discharge would constitute a danger to himself or others. The state supreme court concluded that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593(c), as applied to defendant, provided him with periodic judicial review sufficient to satisfy his state procedural due process rights. In addition, defendant had standing to bring equal protection challenges. His federal equal protection rights were not violated because a rational basis existed for the disparate treatment accorded an acquittee and a civilly committed inmate. Because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593(c) discriminated among, rather than between, the protected class of psychiatrically disabled individuals, Connecticut judicial decisions required review of the statute under a rational basis standard, rather than a strict scrutiny standard. Because a rational basis existed for the disparate treatment under federal equal protection, defendant's state equal protection guarantees were also necessarily satisfied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant answered the door and told an officer that he would accept the package. Police officers then arrested defendant, and, while standing in a common hallway of the house, the officers observed that defendant's apartment door was approximately six inches ajar. They asked defendant whether anyone was in the apartment, but received no response. The officers entered the apartment and, in defendant's bedroom, they observed in plain view on top of defendant's bed a homemade crack pipe, a dinner plate containing crack cocaine residue, and a rolled up $ 1 bill containing crack cocaine. On appeal, the court found that based on the totality of all the facts and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, the warrantless search of defendant's apartment was not a justifiable protective sweep.

The development company voted to use the power of eminent domain to acquire properties within the development area whose owners had not been willing to sell them. After several owners objected, the appellate court construed the ambiguous term &quot;unified land and water areas&quot; in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-186 as not being impermissibly broad. The owners claimed that the condemnation of property for economic development by private parties was inconsistent with prior public use decisions. However, municipal economic development was, in and of itself, a constitutionally valid public use under the well established broad, purposive approach. Accordingly, any private benefit from such economic development was secondary to the public benefit resulting from significant economic growth in a community. Finally, the owners did not prove that the use of eminent domain was facially unconstitutional when used in furtherance of an economic development plan.</SPAN></P>

The personnel director received a FOIA request from a newspaper reporter to review the employee's personnel file.

After determining to his own satisfaction that it contained no such materials, he made the file available to the reporter. The employee's substitute complaint made no allegations as to any statute abrogating governmental immunity to the tort of invasion of privacy. Further, although the FOIA recognized certain privacy interests, the act as a whole was not intended to protect those interests. Also, the employee failed to provide any evidence that the release of her personnel file was pursuant to a final government policy or custom with regard to individual privacy rights. Finally, the employee's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress was barred by governmental immunity, and thus, summary judgment was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's interview with the police was not a custodial interrogation for Miranda purposes. Because defendant's claim on appeal was frivolous, counsel was not required to consult with defendant regarding a conditional plea of nolo contendere.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the allegations of misconduct did not violate the attorney's due process rights. Further, the trial court properly credited the testimony of the witnesses who testified that they did not understand that, by signing a sign-up sheet, they were authorizing the attorney to bring an action in their names. The appellate court rejected the contentions that the evidence did not support the determination that the attorney violated multiple rules of professional conduct.

The appellate court held that the detective failed to offer evidence that job stress and the resulting disease were peculiar to or so distinctively associated with his occupation that there was a direct causal connection between the duties of the employment and the disease. Therefore, the detective did not prove that his heart disease was an occupational disease. The appellate court discounted the detective's claim that his heart disease was an occupational disease pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5-145a, 5-145c, and 7-433c(a). Those statutes were also subject to the jurisdictional and procedural requirements of the Connecticut Workers' Compensation Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was charged with crimes in Connecticut and was soon thereafter arrested in Pennsylvania in connection with those charges and held as a fugitive. The inmate could not post bond and contested Connecticut's efforts to extradite him, serving 128 days in Pennsylvania before extradition. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced. Following sentencing, the inmate sought credit toward his sentence under &sect; 18-98d. Respondent Commissioner of Correction denied the request and the trial court denied the inmate's habeas petition. On appeal, the sole issue was whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required that the inmate be awarded presentence confinement credit for the period of time that he was incarcerated in Pennsylvania. The court concluded that the inmate was not entitled to such credit. The Equal Protection Clause was not implicated because persons such as the inmate who were confined in another state pending extradition were not similarly situated to persons who were confined in Connecticut pending trial. The inmate faced extradition only because he chose to flee to Pennsylvania after he had committed the assault that led to his conviction in Connecticut.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of a capital felony and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court found the weighing provisions of &sect; 53a-46a(e), (f) constitutional under a Geisler factor analysis. The court found that the U.S. and Connecticut Constitutions did not impose any specific standard to be employed in the weighing process, and accordingly, a finding that the aggravating factor outweighed the mitigating factor was sufficient. However, the court held that the jury's subjective level of certitude in reaching the determination that the death penalty was the appropriate punishment was to be &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; The court also found reversible error in the multiple improprieties in the prosecutor's closing argument. Evidence regarding lack of remorse was properly admitted to infer cruelty as an aggravator. Various evidentiary rulings were reviewed, there was no Eighth Amendment violation by the &quot;facts and circumstances&quot; language of &sect; 53a-46a(d), expert testimony was properly admitted, and a special verdict was not required.</SPAN></P>

The utility company provided no authority or analysis in support of its specific claim that requiring it to apply the proceeds from the sale of nonutility land to reduce its stranded costs constituted a taking. The trial court properly declined to consider the constitutional claim. Only reasonable expenses that had been incurred in connection with the transaction that resulted in the actual sale could be deducted from the sales price under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-244f(a)(2). The trial court properly determined that certain testimony constituted substantial evidence supporting the department's finding that the expenses incurred by the utility company in prior years in connection with the negotiations with a purchasing company were not related to the actual sale.

The Superior Court, Judicial District of New Haven, Connecticut, denied the tenant's motion to enjoin but stayed the execution of ejectment. The tenant filed a writ of error under Conn. Gen.

The supreme court found that the writ of error was moot, the tenant having moved out, but that the exception to the mootness doctrine applied because the issue was one of public importance and was capable of repetition, yet evaded review. The denial of the tenant's motion to enjoin the ejectment was a final judgment under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-263, since the order so concluded her rights that further proceedings could not affect them. As the supreme court could consider the assignee's right to possession without opening the judgment of foreclosure, it had subject matter jurisdiction. As to the merits, the supreme court held that Conn. Gen.

Relying largely on the psychiatric security review board's revocation of defendant's conditional release, and applying the definition of &quot;psychiatric disabilities&quot; found in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-458(a), the trial court found that defendant had psychiatric disabilities to the extent that discharge would constitute a danger to herself or others. The supreme court found that although the trial court looked to the wrong statute for the proper definition of &quot;psychiatric disability,&quot; the definition in Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 17a-581-2(a)(5) was the proper one, it nonetheless applied the correct standard and properly found that defendant posed a danger if released. Further, the trial court's determination that defendant was not a person who should be discharged was not arbitrary, fundamentally unfair, or intended to facilitate her perpetual confinement.</SPAN></P>

The LLC's complaint challenged both the legality of the process pursuant to which the city adopted the development plan and the necessity of the demolition component of the plan. However, the appellate court held the allegations provided no indication as to how or why the adoption and implementation of the development plan was likely to cause unreasonable harm to the environment, as it was not evident how the failure to follow certain procedural requirements in adopting the development plan or to consider alternatives to the demolition of buildings was likely to cause harm. The LLC failed to demonstrate how its members had been &quot;specially and injuriously affected&quot; by appellees' conduct. The LLC's claims of statutory aggrievement under Conn. Gen.

The Superior Court, Judicial District of New London, Connecticut, denied defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee alleged that in retaliation for his whistle-blowing, some defendants falsely imprisoned him in a jury room and made defamatory statements about him to a newspaper. The trial court held that (1) the civil conspiracy claims fell under the exception to sovereign immunity for actions by state officers in excess of their statutory authority; and (2) as to the remaining claims, the legislature had waived sovereign immunity by enacting Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6-30a (Rev. to 1999), which required sheriffs to obtain liability insurance. The supreme court disagreed. It overruled Shay v. Rossi, 253 Conn. 134, 749 A.2d 1147 (2000), and Antinerella v. Rioux, 229 Conn. 479, 642 A.2d 699 (1994), to the extent they held that sovereign immunity did not bar monetary damages actions against state officials acting in excess of their statutory authority. As the employee sought only money damages, and had not sought permission of the claims commissioner, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-160(a), to sue the State, his civil conspiracy claims were precluded. The remaining claims were also barred, as the enactment of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6-30a was not a waiver of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court reversed, based on a recent decision in which it held that the exception to sovereign immunity for actions by state officers in excess of their statutory authority applied only to actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, not to claims for money damages.

Her employer paid for medical costs and lost wages. However, the workers' compensation commissioner denied benefits for the scarring itself after finding that it was not the kind of scarring that was compensable under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-308(c). The employee filed a negligence suit against the employer, and the trial court reserved two questions. The court held that the employee's negligence claim was barred by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-284(a) because her scarring arose from a compensable injury. The employee could not &quot;unbundle&quot; a noncompensable part of her underlying injury from the compensable part and bring an action on the former while seeking workers' compensation for the latter. The exclusivity provision was also not unconstitutional as applied to the facts of the case. The employee had received prompt compensation for the burn injury, and the worker's compensation act, when viewed as a whole, provided the employee with a reasonable alternative to her prior common law right to bring tort claims for injuries suffered in the course of employment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 53a-54b(8) was constitutional in its mandatory imposition of life imprisonment because it was not disproportionate to the crime and did not violate U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV. Under a rational basis standard of review, there was no equal protection violation because the punishment protected against the killing of a child. The jury verdict as to findings of intent on the various conviction was not inconsistent, and denial of defendant's motion for a mistrial due to the presence of uniformed correction officers at his trial was proper where no actual prejudice was shown.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-167a. The Appellate Court of Connecticut, in reversing and remanding, concluded that the trial court improperly denied defendant's motion to suppress on the ground that his conduct constituted a new crime that broke the chain of causation, dissipating the taint of police officers' unlawful entry. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue in the certified appeal was whether defendant's conduct in response to the police officers' illegal entry into the backyard of his residence to ticket cars dissipated the taint of their unlawful entry and thereby precluded defendant from invoking the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence derived from the unlawful entry. The Connecticut Supreme Court, in overruling part of its Gallagher decision, (1) adopted the exception to the exclusionary rule that the commission of a new crime dissipated the taint from evidence of that crime obtained as the result of an illegal entry into one's home, and (2) concluded that because, at the time of the relevant events, defendant had a limited common-law right to resist an unlawful, warrantless entry into the backyard of his residence, it could not retroactively apply the new crime exception to defendant. The Supreme Court did not have to consider whether to engraft an officer's bad faith limitation to the new crime exception, and did not abrogate the common law privilege to offer reasonable resistance, not rising to the level of an assault (not common law assault, but the Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-167c crime) to an unlawful entry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Connecticut Superior Court, Fairfield Judicial District, after defendant's guilty plea, convicted him of, inter alia, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-48(a), 53a-134(a)(2) conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, and sentenced him in accordance with his plea. Defendant appealed and claimed he was improperly sentenced under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-134(b) to a five-year nonsuspendable mandatory minimum sentence for that conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court also convicted defendant of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-48(a), 53a-122 conspiracy to commit first degree larceny and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-136a robbery of an occupied vehicle. Under the Trent principle regarding the sentence for Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-51 inchoate crimes, such as attempts and conspiracy, defendant was subject to the specific sentence delineated for the most serious offense attempted. Thus, the sentence for conspiracy to commit first degree robbery equaled the sentence for first degree robbery. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-134(b) mandated a five-year nonsuspendable mandatory term of imprisonment for first degree robbery. The supreme court applied rational basis review to determine the &sect; 53a-134(b) sentence complied with the Equal Protection Clause. There was a rational basis for the punishment of conspiracy to commit first degree robbery to be greater than the punishment of conspiracy to commit murder, two separate and distinct crimes. The legislature could have believed in regard to conspiracy to commit first degree robbery that (1) trial courts were less likely to impose a minimum five-year sentence, and (2) a more severe penalty was required to deter it.</SPAN></P>

The panel did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a continuance. The appellate court found further that the panel reasonably could have concluded that defendant's abuse as a child did not constitute such a reason. The appellate court concluded that defendant's proof did not compel a finding of mitigation. Finally, to the extent that defendant claimed that his extreme emotional disturbance met the requirements of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-46a(g), his claim was rejected.

Someone had been improperly gaining access to his office, calling into question the security of the airport. The employee was transferred and demoted after he cooperated with the state police in a criminal investigation of several fellow employees, including the individual defendants. The conduct was under color of state law. Given the risk of terrorism, the appellate court held the employee's speech could fairly be considered to relate to a matter of political and social concern to the community. The individual defendants did not dispute that they were substantially motivated by the employee's speech when they took action against him. The First Amendment interest in encouraging, rather than suppressing, the employee's speech about this breakdown in airport security was great. By contrast, the State's interest in promoting the efficiency of its services by taking action against the employee for his speech about a critical breach of airport security was minimal. The reassignments were highly degrading, indicating that the true motive was vengeance and the claimed governmental objective was pretextual.</SPAN></P>

Further, the fact-finding inherent in evaluating a claimed violation was entrusted by the legislature to the commissioner, and the appellate court found no reason to usurp his authority to handle the company's claim. Because the company could have obtained review of the town's order, the company was required to do so before seeking redress in court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff estate filed a wrongful death action against defendant station owner. The station owner filed an apportionment complaint alleging that apportionment defendant, the shooter, acted recklessly and wilfully and wantonly. The estate moved to strike the apportionment complaint. The station owner appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk (Connecticut) striking the apportionment complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The station owner argued that the trial court erred in granting the estate's motion to strike the apportionment complaint against the shooter because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-572h(o) precluded apportionment of damages between parties on any basis other than negligence. The station owner argued that the retroactive application of 1999 Conn. Acts 69, &sect; 1(o) violated the doctrine of separation of powers and the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The supreme court held that the trial court properly determined that the legislature clarified Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 25-572h (Rev. to 1997) in enacting 1999 Conn. Acts 69, &sect; 1(o), and, therefore, retroactive application of the statute, as amended, did not violate the state and federal constitutions. The station owner also contended that application of 1999 Conn. Acts 69, &sect; 1(o) deprived it of a vested property interest. The supreme court concluded that since the legislature merely clarified what its intent was when enacting Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-572h, the amendment clearly satisfied the rational basis test. In addition, the supreme court concluded that the station owner never had a vested interest in the claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Connecticut Workers' Compensation Commissioner, Second District, awarded to plaintiff employee retroactive compensation for temporary partial incapacity, and ordered defendant employer, pursuant to Conn.

The employee injured both legs in a work accident and needed right knee, then left knee, replacements to achieve maximum medical improvement (MMI) respectively for each leg. The supreme court determined the rational basis, rather than strict scrutiny (disability and age classes were not presumptively invidious), test applied to the employee's equal protection and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 arguments against the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-307(e). Section 31-307(e) was constitutional; reducing costs by reducing payments to persons retired from the workforce was a reasonably conceivable rational basis for applying the offset to one subset of the disabled, the totally incapacitated, but not to another subset, the partially incapacitated. Under Conn. Gen.

The supreme court, in affirming, explained its Geisler III exclusionary rule exception (the attenuation decision). Under the totality of the circumstances, including (1) 11 hours between defendant's arrest and incriminating statement after his improper warrantless arrest in his home, but based on probable cause; (2) defendant's twice receiving Miranda warnings; and (3) police misconduct that was neither purposeful nor flagrant, defendant's statement was sufficiently attenuated from the taint of the arrest and was properly admitted by the trial court. Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7 protections were broader than the Fourth Amendment's, so the supreme court used the analytical framework of the U.S. Supreme Court's facts-and-circumstances attenuation (the Brown test) and rejected the U.S. Supreme Court's Harris test. Under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner alleged that the zoning variance denial by the town's zoning board of appeals, which was affirmed on appeal, constituted an inverse condemnation. The owner sought compensation under the takings clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The property was a gas station that sold snacks and the owner wanted to add a convenience store. The trial court's holding that collateral estoppel barred the litigation of facts that had been decided by the board was reversed by the court, which found no bar to the presentation of facts that were pertinent to the claim on the basis of policy considerations. Further, the court found that the factual issues were not actually litigated in the administrative appeal. The owner was entitled to a de novo review without reliance on the board's prior fact finding. The holding that there was no right to a jury trial under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 was affirmed. The court noted that the inverse condemnation action was an adequate post-deprivation remedy. Accordingly, if any taking occurred, it was not tortious and therefore not an action at law, but rather one in equity, similar to an eminent domain proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings.

The legislature's attempt to limit the court's discretion to release a defendant on bail in cases involving the use of force applied to so many cases that it impermissibly interfered with the trial court's orderly functioning, on its face. The statute interfered with the trial court by: (1) rendering the right to appeal meaningless, as the incarceration required could end before an appeal was decided; (2) requiring incarceration of a defendant pending sentencing who might be sentenced to probation or a fine; (3) interfering with a trial court's discretion to find a defendant's conviction legally flawed, as defendant's incarceration was required pending a decision on that issue; and (4) interfering with a court's ability to impose an incarceration alternative, such as treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of first degree burglary and first degree sexual assault in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Britain (Connecticut), the trial court granted defendant an appeal bond in spite of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-63f's prohibition on bail for a defendant convicted of an offense involving physical force. The State appealed, and the victim filed a writ of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found the statute interfered with the judicial magistracy. The supreme court held the victim's ultimate argument that the trial court erred in finding the prohibition of defendant's release unconstitutional was also the State's position, so it was unnecessary to decide her standing to bring a writ, and the supreme court would not address a constitutional question unless required to. The legislature's attempt to limit a court's discretion to release a defendant on bail in cases involving the use of force applied to so many cases that it impermissibly interfered with the trial court's orderly functioning on its face. The statute interfered with the trial court by (1) rendering the right to appeal meaningless as the incarceration required could end before an appeal was decided; (2) requiring incarceration of a defendant pending sentencing who might be sentenced to probation or a fine; (3) interfering with a trial court's discretion to find a defendant's conviction legally flawed as defendant's incarceration was required pending a decision on that issue; and (4) interfering with a court's ability to impose an incarceration alternative, such as treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order releasing defendant on bail was affirmed, and the victim's writ of error was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

When defendant heard the sound of a police radio, he took the victim's gun, entered a common hallway, and shot the officer in the head as he passed by. Prior to trial, the State notified defendant that it would seek the death penalty, inter alia, on the basis of the fact that he committed the murder &quot;in expectation of the receipt of&quot; something of pecuniary value, an aggravating factor under Conn.

The trial court blocked that action, however, on the basis of its finding that &sect; 53a-46a(i)(6) applied only to killings that were an essential prerequisite to obtaining something of pecuniary value and not to capital offenses committed during the course of a robbery.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Fairfield (Connecticut) for murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been charged in connection with a death. While awaiting trial on the murder charge, defendant also was charged with attempt to commit murder as a result of a letter he sent requesting the primary witness be killed. His first trial resulted in a mistrial as to the murder charge. Thereafter, he was convicted in a second trial following a Chip Smith instruction. The appellate court held the trial court properly utilized the Chip Smith charge in instructing the jury. The instruction struck a fair balance between aiding the jury in the deliberative process and reminding jurors not to surrender their conscientiously held beliefs, notwithstanding the language instructing minority view jurors to reconsider their position in light of the position of majority view jurors. Even so, the appellate court set out a specifically worded instruction to be used in the future in order to avoid questions of coercion. The trial court also carefully weighed the probative value of the evidence of defendant's other criminal acts against its prejudicial effect and properly determined that any resulting prejudice did not outweigh the probative value of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 12-119 to hear the owner's claim; and (2) that the transfer of the property to the owner did not initiate a new 10-year holding period for the purposes of assessing a conveyance tax. The appellate court held that (1) as the owner's claim challenged the validity of the tax in the first instance, the trial court had jurisdiction; and (2) the transfer from the executors to the owner was an exempt transaction under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-504c(k) as it was transferred as a result of death by devise. The date of the acquisition was the date that the executors acquired the land and since the executors acquired the land by a devise, the date of their acquisition related back to the date of the original classification in 1971. Accordingly, since the subsequent sale by the owner was not within a 10-year period, the transfer was not subject to a conveyance tax under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-504a(b).</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 53a-183a. The Superior Court, Litchfield (Connecticut), denied defendants' motion to dismiss. Defendants then pled nolo contendere and were convicted. Defendants appealed and the case was transferred. Following a remand, the trial court made findings. Defendants again appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants had interfered with a legal bow hunter in a state wildlife management area. Defendants argued that the Act was an unconstitutional restriction on the First Amendment. The appellate court held that forum classification was determined by the traditional uses and principal purpose of the land, and not by the presence of some incidental characteristics typical of another type of forum. State forests were nonpublic fora, and thus the State was allowed to enforce time, place and manner regulations, and reserve the forum for its intended purposes, communicative or otherwise, as long as the regulation on speech was reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials opposed the speaker's view. The government's decision to restrict access to a nonpublic forum needed only be reasonable; it did not need to be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation. Connecticut had a significant interest in supporting regulated hunting, trapping and fishing. The Act was narrowly tailored to protect the act of taking of wildlife and left open ample alternative means of communication. Thus, the Act did not violate the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen requested disclosure by the plaintiffs of all of the town's legal bills, receipts, itemized statements and similar instruments since a certain date. The controller did not allow the citizen to view certain billing invoices of the town counsel because they involved pending litigation. The citizen subsequently filed a complaint with the commission requesting that plaintiffs be compelled to disclose the invoices. The supreme court held there were two issues. First, whether retroactive application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-146r would prevent the disclosure of certain documents pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, specifically Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-210. Second, whether &sect; 1-210(b)(10)&nbsp;unconstitutionally delegated to the freedom of information commission the authority to define the attorney-client privilege in violation of Connecticut's separation of powers doctrine. The supreme court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-146r, if applied retroactively, did not prevent the disclosure of the documents at issue, and that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-210(b)(10) was constitutionally sound. The commission correctly concluded that the invoices were not exempt from disclosure.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed and defendant cross appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived with his girlfriend and her two children and was not the biological father of either child, but took care of them and considered himself to be their stepfather. Defendant's assault convictions were based on two separate acts of omission, which led to two, not six, discrete injuries to the baby daughter. As a result of defendant's failure to help, the child was exposed to conduct which created a risk of death to her and the child suffered subsequent serious physical injuries. Defendant had an affirmative duty to act and criminal liability was imposed for defendant's failure to act pursuant to that duty. The State's alleged failure to introduce sufficient evidence to prove that the mother had caused the victim's abuse did not mean that there was insufficient evidence on which to convict defendant under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-59(a)(3). The evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that defendant was actually aware of and consciously disregarded the abuse. Double jeopardy was not violated since (1) there were two separate acts of omission; and (2) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53-21, 53a-59(a)(3) were not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court remanded the case to the appellate court with direction to (1) affirm the trial court's judgment of guilty only as to two counts of assault in the first degree and one count of risk of injury to a child, and, (2) under the aggregate package theory of sentencing, to remand the case to the trial court to resentence defendant for those crimes to a term of not more than his original sentence of 40 years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While serving a sentence for two crimes, defendant petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, seeking presentence confinement credit under Conn.

The Appellate Court, Connecticut, affirmed the habeas court's dismissal of the petition. Defendant appealed, and his petition for certification was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 18-98d entitled him to presentence confinement credit for the periods during which he was (1) incarcerated in Massachusetts before his extradition, (2) in transit from Massachusetts to Connecticut, and (3) confined at a Connecticut police department before his arraignment. Based on case law interpreting Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-98, which was a similar statute applicable to defendants who committed offenses prior to July 1, 1981, the state supreme court held that defendant was not entitled to the credit he sought.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-98d essentially authorized presentence credit for pretrial detainees whose confinement was subject to the control of the Connecticut Commissioner of Correction. Defendant was not subject to such control during any of the three periods for which he sought credit. Contrary to defendant's contentions, denial of the presentence credit at issue did not involve a fundamental right, and such denial did not violate defendant's substantive due process or equal protection rights, as there was a rational basis for distinguishing between detainees who were subject to the commissioner's control and discipline and those who were not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a town and its workers' compensation provider, appealed from a decision of the workers' compensation review board, which affirmed the workers' compensation commissioner's approval of the use of a manual calculation method rather than the statutory compensation tables in calculating benefits for appellee, a workers' compensation claimant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the use of wage tables in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-310(b) was limited to injured employees who contributed to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) by the plain language of the statute, as well as its legislative history. The town had standing to appeal the workers' compensation review board's decision, basing its appeal on its own injury. The town was litigating a nonconstitutional issue, namely, the proper construction of &sect; 31-310(b), and was affected adversely by the construction of that statute. Therefore, the town had standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 31-310(b). The legislation neither created a suspect classification nor impinged upon a fundamental right for the purposes of the Equal Protection Clause. Thus, the constitutional challenge was analyzed under the rational basis test. Because there was a plausible reason for the legislature's action, the fact that the workers' compensation scheme set forth in &sect; 31-310(b) ultimately resulted in a somewhat higher compensation rate for certain employees was of no constitutional import, and the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed and the case was remanded to the compensation review board with direction to establish the rate of interest and to calculate the amount of the award of interest pursuant to Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Superior Court in the Judicial District of New London (Connecticut) judgment, after granting defendant's motion to suppress prescription records, dismissed a substitute information charging defendant with 32 counts each of the crimes of obtaining a controlled substance containing codeine, by forgery of a prescription and forgery in the second degree. The State's appeal was transferred by the appellate court to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's allegedly forged prescriptions were uncovered in connection with an investigation of the frequency with which a certain physician was prescribing controlled medications. The pharmacy consented to release of its prescription records to investigators without a search warrant. Defendant maintained that the release of his prescription records without a search warrant violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-265 and his Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy. The supreme court held that by its plain language, &sect; 21a-265 affirmatively authorized federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel to review controlled substance prescription records subject to consideration of the pharmacist's constitutional rights. The investigator was acting with the police when he obtained defendant's prescription records and was authorized under &sect; 21a-265, to obtain those records with the pharmacist's consent. Section 21a-265's statutory scheme, like New York's in Whalen, adequately safeguarded the privacy interests of persons who obtained prescriptions for controlled substances and &sect; 21a-265 did not violate defendant's Fourteenth Amendment privacy rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, the Superior Court, Fairfield (Connecticut), convicted defendant for assault in the first degree and kidnapping.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant held the victim captive and then brutalized her. The state's highest court held that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated and that the trial court properly admitted the expert testimony of the clinical social worker and defendant's prior misconduct. First, the trial court's inquiry was sufficient to establish that defendant's grievance against his counsel did show prejudice or adverse representation for a conflict of interest. Second, the social worker, as an expert on battered women's syndrome, provided the jury with a framework within which it could place and possibly explain the victim's alleged behavior. Third, the evidence of defendant's prior incidences of violence toward the victim was relevant as it corroborated the social worker's testimony. Moreover, the evidentiary substantiation of the vicious depravity of the conduct for which defendant was charged far outweighed the prejudicial impact of the prior misconduct. Finally, the police had reasonable cause to suspect that defendant was dangerous. Accordingly, searching the coat before placing it on defendant was reasonable under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal concerned the constitutionality of the trial court's application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-59, in awarding visitation rights with the father's minor child to the child's maternal grandmother. The father claimed that in light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Troxel, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-59 was unconstitutional as applied to the facts of the case under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Tied to the challenge was his claim regarding the threshold issue of jurisdiction. The supreme court concluded that, because the grandmother failed to allege and establish that she had a parent-like relationship with the child and that the child would suffer real and significant harm if visitation with the grandmother were denied, the trial court improperly granted the visitation petition in contravention of the father's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, maternal grandmother and maternal aunt, sought visitation rights with defendant father's minor children. A Superior Court in the Judicial District of Danbury (Connecticut) granted plaintiffs' motion to open the judgment for the father and rendered judgment granting visitation rights to plaintiffs pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-59. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought visitation three months after the mother had committed suicide and did not contend that the father was in any way an unfit parent. The father objected to visitation with plaintiffs because he believed their morals, values, and ethics were inconsistent with his own and those that he wished to instill in his children, ages two and four. The supreme court addressed the issue of first impression, namely, whether &sect; 46b-59 was constitutional under the Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const. XIV and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The supreme court determined that &sect; 46b-59 was unconstitutional as applied to the extent that the trial court, pursuant to &sect; 46b-59, permitted third party visitation contrary to the desires of a fit parent and in the absence of any allegation and proof by clear and convincing evidence that the children would suffer actual and significant harm if deprived of the visitation. Plaintiffs also failed to establish that their ongoing relationship with the children rose to a requisite parental type level required under &sect; 46b-59. The cited Troxel case expressed a parent's fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of his children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment and remanded the case with direction to dismiss the petition. The supreme court concluded that (1) the allegations were facially insufficient to demonstrate the required relationship for standing and to invoke properly the court's jurisdiction; and (2) the evidence could not, even under a generous interpretation, satisfy the requisite burden of persuasion that the supreme court articulated.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that federal law preempted parties other than cable operators from appealing the renewal of a franchise. The court noted that 47 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 546, 555 allow for judicial review of a franchise renewal in limited circumstances, none of which were present. The supreme court concluded that in light of congress's intent to limit the parties and circumstances under which review could be sought, the court could not conclude that there was otherwise an inherent right to appeal the terms and conditions of a franchise renewal. Although there was a state statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen.

The supreme court analyzed the several statutes which authorized a town to condemn and which set forth procedures to condemn. The owner was objecting to the condemnation statutory procedures on constitutional grounds. However, the $ 19,750,000 condemnation plan had been put to the town's voters during the litigation. The voters rejected the plan. The voters, not the selectmen, were the legislative body with condemning authority. Therefore, the plan and study had become moot.

The Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford (Connecticut) dismissed the petition and the prisoner appealed. The state supreme court transferred the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was prosecuted in 1990 for kidnapping and assault, but he was acquitted by reason of lack of capacity. After that finding, the trial judge placed the prisoner in the custody of the Connecticut Commissioner of Mental Health for 10 years. In 1993, the prisoner filed a successful action to vacate the trial court's judgment, but as a result, he was retried. The state supreme court held that the prisoner's due process rights were not violated because he was convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison after a second trial because (1) it was highly questionable whether his successful challenge to the first trial provided a proper predicate for application of the Pearce rule; and (2) even if the court assumed that the sentence imposed after the prisoner's second trial was greater than that imposed after his first trial, evidence cited by the second trial judge which showed, inter alia, that the prisoner refused to accept responsibility for his misconduct, lacked remorse for his crimes, and refused to acknowledge his mental illness was sufficient to justify the second sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in the Judicial District of Waterbury (Connecticut) entered a judgment, upon a jury verdict, convicting defendant of one count each of murder under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54a, felony murder under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54c, manslaughter in the first degree under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-55(a)(1), and two counts of robbery in the first degree under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-134(a)(3). Defendant appealed his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised numerous points of error. In response, the state supreme court held, first, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant defendant a new trial, because the verdict was not based on conclusions that were scientifically impossible. Second, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for a mistrial, because there was nothing in the record that demonstrated that the jury disregarded the trial court's instructions to ignore a certain expert's stricken testimony when it was deliberating. Third, the prosecutor's closing remarks, though improper, did not deprive defendant of due process and his constitutional right to a fair trial. Fourth, the representation of defendant's palm print as being bloody, though improper, was not so harmful that it likely affected the trial's result. Lastly, defendant's constitutional right against double jeopardy was violated, because he was convicted of intentional and felony murder of the same victim, and the jury was improperly instructed to find him guilty of intentional manslaughter in the first degree in the event that it found him guilty of intentional murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction of manslaughter in the first degree was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court with directions to: (1) vacate defendant's conviction of manslaughter in the first degree; (2) combine defendant's convictions of felony murder and intentional murder; and (3) vacate the sentence for defendant's felony murder conviction. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued: (1) Conn. Gen.

The state supreme court held, first, that defendant was on sufficient notice that his conduct would be considered likely to impair the morals of the victim and, therefore, &sect; 53-21 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the instant case. Second, the overinclusive jury charge did not deny defendant his due process rights, because jurors were well-equipped to analyze evidence that contained a factually inadequate theory. Third, the single impropriety in the prosecutor's comments was not sufficiently egregious to infect the whole trial. Finally, there was sufficient evidence of kidnapping, because the jury reasonably could have found that defendant used both physical force and intimidation to interfere with the victim's liberty and confine her to the car.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held defendant's version of events did not warrant such an instruction as he argued he never had possession, not that he had joint possession.

The company was the only company affected in the state by the legislation. The trial court found there was no evidence of any possible adverse environmental impact. The supreme court held there was no rational basis for the legislation as it was not related to any legitimate state interest. The language of the legislation along with its legislative history indicated the company was specifically targeted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in the Judicial District of Tolland (Connecticut) convicted defendant of manslaughter in the first degree under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-55(a)(3), 53a-55a, and imposed a total effective sentence of 35 years of incarceration, with execution suspended after 19 years, and 5 years of probation. Although defendant was also convicted and sentenced for other offenses, he appealed only the manslaughter conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from a hunting incident that caused the victim's death. On appeal, the state supreme court held, first, that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-55(a)(3) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of the instant case because, in light of the plain meaning and judicial interpretations of the phrases &quot;extreme indifference to human life&quot; and &quot;grave risk of death,&quot; a person of ordinary intelligence would have had fair warning that defendant's actions were proscribed under &sect; 53a-55(a)(3). Second, on the basis of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-202k's plain language, its legislative history, and prior court decisions, the application of &sect; 53-202k's sentence enhancement to first degree manslaughter with a firearm, a Class B felony, did not violate double jeopardy. Third, on the basis of &sect; 53-202k's language and its legislative history, the trial court properly applied &sect; 53-202k's sentence enhancement to defendant's split sentence. Finally, the State proved that defendant's culpable mental state had risen beyond the level required for a finding of mere negligence to the level of aggravated recklessness required for a finding of first degree manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal issue was whether a dispute regarding the legality of certain provisions of the town's charter was rendered moot as a result of subsequent amendments to the charter. The board sought a declaratory judgment invalidating two amendments to the town charter that had been adopted in 1996. The supreme court concluded that the actual controversy recognized by both the parties and the trial court survived 1998 amendments to the town charter and remained in existence. Because the 1998 amendments did not cure the alleged underlying defects with respect to these two provisions, there remained an actual controversy capable of, and requiring, adjudication. The substantive validity of the disputed charter provisions was a matter capable of judicial resolution. Because a controversy regarding the charter provisions remained in effect, and because the board articulated a request for specific relief, the trial court was able to afford practical relief. Because the challenged portions of those provisions, as amended in 1996, were unchanged by the 1998 ordinance, the dispute regarding their legality remained justiciable.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 31-349c(a) precluded an appeal to the commissioner from the decision of the physician panel, the employer should have waited until after that decision was issued to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. However, the ripeness of the constitutional claim was irrelevant to the question of whether the commissioner or the board had jurisdiction to decide the claim, because those bodies did not have jurisdiction to consider constitutional claims. By the time the board issued its opinion, the physician panel had issued its decision. Thus, the claim was ripe at the time of the appeal to the court. The existence of a decision by the physician panel was a ripeness issue that affected only the jurisdiction of the reviewing court, not the finality of the board's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action to enjoin defendants from limiting the use of the defendant town's recreational beach park area to town residents, the Superior Court in the judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk (Connecticut) ruled for the defendants, from which plaintiff individual appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment and remanded the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether a municipality could constitutionally restrict access to a municipal park to its residents and their guests. The instant court concluded that such a restriction was prohibited by the First Amendment and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 4, 5, and 14, based on the federal and state constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and freedom of association. The court first examined the individual's claim that the ordinance violated the First Amendment as applied and on its face. In view of the facility's amenities it was clear that it qualified as a park for First Amendment purposes. The town lawfully could not bar the individual solely because he was a nonresident, because the park was a public forum. Because the town's ordinance restricting the park's use by nonresidents could not be justified on the ground that it was narrowly tailored to meet a compelling need, it was facially overbroad. The challenged ordinance also unquestionably violated the individual's right to engage in protected expressive and associational activities under the more speech protective test adopted for purposes of &sect;&sect; 4, 5, and 14.</SPAN></P>

Thus, a Franks hearing was not necessary. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to exclude mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) evidence on the basis that it was sufficiently reliable under the Daubert standard. Its probative value was not outweighed by undue prejudice.

The trial court informed the attorney that it was his burden to show the court which rule he had followed in filing the brief. The trial court sanctioned the attorney, and the attorney appealed. The intermediate court dismissed the appeal because the attorney was not a party to the underlying action, and the attorney filed a writ of error. The appellate court found that because no fundamental right had been implicated, the attorney's facial challenge failed. Further, the appellate court found that the attorney was adequately warned and on notice that court permission was required prior to the filing of an amicus brief in the trial court.

On certification, the appellate court found that defendant's due process claim did merit appellate review and, furthermore, that the plea agreement and resulting imposition of the nine year sentence did not satisfy the requirements of due process. The appellate court found, further, that the trial court, in wielding its power as it did, discharged its sentencing function in a manner that was legally indistinguishable from the kind of unilateral imposition of a penalty upon a defendant who has chosen to exercise a legal right that has been held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff removed its one machine from defendant town, sued, and won. On appeal, the Connecticut Supreme Court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-289a, regulating the placement of such machines, did not preempt the ordinance. Merely because intervening defendant stopped short of imposing a ban on cigarette vending machines did not translate into an intent by the legislature to preserve the vending machine industry. There was no clear legislative intent to preclude local action. Defendant's power to regulate was derived from its general public health powers in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-148(c)(7)(H)(xi), not just from Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-289a(h). The ordinance was consistent with intervening defendant's objective in limiting youth access to tobacco products.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Stamford-Norwalk Superior Court (Connecticut) which rendered judgment on the verdict, after a jury found defendant guilty of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70(a), and sentenced defendant to 20 years imprisonment, execution suspended after 16 years, and 10 years probation. The supreme court transferred the appeal pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-199(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual assault in the first degree. On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, the trial court: (1) improperly denied his pretrial motion to sequester the jury due to pretrial publicity surrounding the case; (2) improperly denied his motion in limine to preclude the state from offering evidence of his flight from the country; and (3) violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws by imposing a 10 year probationary period. The supreme court concluded the trial court's decision not to sequester the jury did not constitute an abuse of its discretion because there was nothing in the record to suggest the trial atmosphere was utterly corrupted by media coverage. Further, the supreme court found that because the jury reasonably could have inferred a guilty conscience motivated defendant's flight, the evidence was relevant and admissible. Finally, the supreme court agreed the trial court violated the constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws. By employing Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-29 (as amended), the trial court improperly imposed &quot;additional punishment,&quot; more than that which was prescribed at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court of Connecticut found that the dictionary meaning of the word &quot;appropriate&quot; was different from the definition in &sect; 53a-118(a)(4)(B), and therefore the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the statutory meaning of the word was error of constitutional magnitude. However, since the defendant had not brought forth facts at trial contesting this element, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant also argued that the waiver rule was unconstitutional, but as he had failed to provide a complete record, the Connecticut Supreme Court declined to address this argument. Since the defendant failed to provide a complete record, his argument on sufficiency of the evidence was not addressed. Finally, there was no permanency element required under Conn. Gen.

Defendant contended that his initial detention and patdown was not based upon a reasonable and articulable suspicion that he had committed or was about to commit a crime. The Supreme Court of Connecticut disagreed and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Specifically, the appellate court found that the bulge in the defendant's sock added to the officer's reasonable suspicions that the defendant was either carrying a weapon or was in the process of committing a felony. Accordingly, the arrest itself was supported by probable cause, therefore, the search of the defendant's sock and the seizure of cocaine therefrom were sufficiently contemporaneous with his arrest so as to qualify as a search incident to a lawful arrest. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that under Fairfield, Connecticut, Zoning Regulations &sect; 11.1.1, beach property was limited to a single detached dwelling for one family, which could not be occupied by more than four unrelated persons. The regulations did not preclude renting of beach property. Under zoning regulations, plaintiffs were prevented from renting the property on a year-round basis rather than seasonally. The condition also reduced the value of the property, as the house would bring less when sold due to the inability to rent it.

The trial court affirmed and plaintiffs appealed, contending that &sect; 9-333w(a) was violative of U.S. Const. amend. I, that defendant's handling of the relevant complaints violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights, and that defendant's composition violated Connecticut's separation of powers doctrine. The court affirmed. Section 9-333w(a) was constitutional because it was narrowly tailored to serve the state's compelling interests in preventing corruption in candidate elections, advancing the state's ability to investigate campaign finance laws, providing the electorate with information, and deterring fraud. Defendant had not violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights via its handling of the relevant complaints. The composition of defendant did not violate Connecticut's separation of powers doctrine, as, in Connecticut, the appointment of high ranking state officers was not exclusively under the control of the executive branch.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, with plaintiffs' appeal pending in the federal court of appeals, certified six questions to the court in plaintiffs', mother and minor son, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against defendant town for a declaration that its nighttime juvenile curfew, Vernon, Conn., Ordinance &sect; 8-4, violated plaintiffs' Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town enacted Vernon, Conn., Ordinance &sect; 8-4, a nighttime juvenile curfew. Plaintiffs, mother and minor son, challenged &sect; 8-4 under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The federal district court upheld &sect; 8-4 as to the federal constitution and certified to the court six questions whether &sect; 8-4 violated Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, and 20. The court answered all questions &quot;no,&quot; in defendant's favor. Section 8-4's provision that plaintiff son might have had to face juvenile authorities gave him standing to sue. The court read &sect; 8-4's exemption for minors exercising U.S. Const. amend. I rights at night to apply to similar state constitutional rights. Although the Connecticut Constitution potentially protected individual rights more than the federal constitution, the burden was on plaintiffs to detail such an argument and plaintiffs did not show that &sect; 8-4 violated rights that went beyond those provided by the federal constitution. Suspected violation of &sect; 8-4 itself justified police seizure of such suspects. Section 8-4 was not overbroad nor too vague, nor violative of equal protection, due process, free speech, assembly, personal liberty, or search and seizure rights.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the trial court's instruction to the jury, that defendant was required to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he was driving his vehicle within the scope of his work permit, unconstitutionally diluted the State's burden of proving the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and reversed only that conviction.

Defendant's questions and instructions to the employees were in English mixed with Spanish. He was positively identified by employees. At trial defendant claimed he was not the perpetrator, because he could not speak much English and needed his interpreter. The State's closing comments to the jury, based in part upon the evidence of defendant's employment history in an English speaking environment, indicated that defendant was faking that he could not understand English. Under these circumstances the court affirmed that the comments were not improper.

The court affirmed the judgment determining that there was no preemption because the program was included within &quot;other terms and conditions&quot; of &sect; 332(c)(3)(A) so such contributions could be required by states without a finding that the providers served as a substitute to land line service for a substantial portion of the state. Step one of the Chevron statutory interpretation review tool, clear Congressional intent, was satisfied. Assessments based on interstate revenue were not shown to rely on or burden federal funding mechanisms and were not prohibited. No inequitable burden on cellular providers was shown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Phrase &quot;other terms and conditions&quot; in federal statute, which states could regulate without having to satisfy the substitutability requirement, encompassed universal service funding requirements; assessment based partly on interstate revenue was not shown to rely on or burden federal funding mechanisms and was not prohibited; and an inequitable burden on cellular providers was not shown.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with felony murder under Conn. Gen.

Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted on the first two counts, and sentenced to 60 years' imprisonment. The trial court then determined, based on evidence presented at trial, that defendant had used a firearm during the commission of the offenses, and imposed an additional five-year sentence to run consecutively. The principal issue on appeal was whether the trial court, rather than the jury, could find that defendant, who was convicted by a jury of a felony, had used a firearm in the commission of such felony. Evidence that defendant used a proscribed firearm was neither overwhelming nor uncontested, nor was such a finding implicit in the verdict. The trial court's failure to instruct the jury on whether defendant utilized a proscribed firearm was not harmless. The case was remanded for a new jury trial on the issue of whether defendant used a proscribed firearm in the commission of the underlying offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because court concluded that finding that defendant used firearm was not indispensable to verdict, and that evidence neither overwhelmingly nor incontrovertibly established that defendant was armed, judgment was reversed in part and case remanded with direction to vacate sentence and for new jury trial on issue of whether defendant used proscribed firearm in commission of underlying offenses. Judgement was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents took child to hospital for leg broken after mother tripped while breast feeding. Because family had sought medical assistance for other children and the physician's initial report suggested abuse, defendants' initiated proceedings to remove children from the family, and persisted their attempts even after that and three other physicians stated no abuse and neighbors stated an overprotective family. Plaintiff family sued defendants in official and individual capacities. Trial court's order denying defendants' motion to dismiss on the basis of sovereign immunity was an appealable final order, because sovereign immunity affects liability and right to sue. The order denying dismissal of suits against defendants in official capacities affirmed and individual capacities reversed, because defendants' alleged actions would exceed the scope of their statutory authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. Facts indicated defendants persisted in efforts to remove children to justify their prior unjustified actions, which were sufficiently egregious to constitute conduct in excess of statutory authority and of sovereign immunity protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was insured under a homeowner's policy issued by defendant. Plaintiff's sister sued plaintiff for conversion, fraud, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, over a jointly-owned property with her mother. She alleged plaintiff obtained a power of attorney and used it to obtain a line of credit secured by the property, resulting in loss of the property's value. Plaintiff brought declaratory judgment action seeking adjudication that defendant had a duty to defend him against his sister's complaint. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted defendant's motion and denied plaintiff's motion. The appellate court affirmed. Conceding there were no disputed questions of fact, the plaintiff claimed defendant had a duty to defend because the insurance policy defined &quot;bodily injury&quot; broadly enough to include emotional distress. The Supreme Court also affirmed, holding defendant had no duty to defend under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Supreme court concluded allegations of emotional distress arising from economic loss did not trigger defendant's duty to defend under homeowner's policy, and affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Court.</SPAN></P>

VIII challenge to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-100 which established lethal injection as Connecticut's method of execution. On appeal, the defendant argued that lethal injection constitutes cruel and unusual punishment because the protocol developed by the commissioner of correction carries an unacceptably high risk that the execution procedure will be botched, and because there is a high risk that the defendant would experience excruciating pain and a lingering death. Plaintiff state responded that lethal injection is the most humane method available for imposing capital punishment. The court affirmed because it concluded that the record failed to establish any reason to infer that the protocol would not be administered properly. On the basis of the testimony introduced regarding the agents utilized pursuant to the protocol and the corresponding dosages, there was no reason to believe that defendant would experience anything more than the insertion of the intravenous catheter followed by unconsciousness.</SPAN></P>
