<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-In support of an affirmance on appeal under Pa.R.A.P. 1925, the court noted that it properly denied a property owner's request to redeem property that was sold due to a failure to pay property taxes because the property was not eligible for redemption, as it was admittedly vacant and redemption was not timely sought pursuant to 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7293; [2]-The owner's assertion that the city failed to properly perfect service was misguided because the city performed posting and multiple mailings, in compliance with the statutory service and notice requirements of 53 Pa.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 7101 et seq., regardless of whether the debt had been accrued by the owner or his tenant; [3]-It was the owner's responsibility to ensure the necessary payments were being made, and he could not claim notice-based constitutional injury when his faith in his tenant's honor and financial integrity was shown to be unwarranted.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 1710(g), the statute's purpose had been satisfied; [2]-The omission of a parcel number was an inadvertent and understandable error in light of the fact that it was a single building that was taxed by the city as a single parcel; [3]-The evidence established that the parcel was clearly understood by all parties, including the condemnees themselves, to be part of the condemnation plan; [4]-Given the untimely nature of the proposed amendments to the condemnees' preliminary objections under 26 Pa.C.S. &sect; 306 and the very limited scope of the common pleas court's consideration of the matter on remand, the request to amend was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

No. 1042.3, and only the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania may amend or modify its Rules of Civil Procedure or the policy decisions relating to Certificates of Merit; [2]-As a result, there was no controlling question of law as to which there was a substantial ground for difference of opinion and, thus, no immediate appeal would materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-The common pleas court entered an opinion in support of its order granting a company's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to an administratrix's wrongful death claims; [2]-Because the supreme court held that Act 152 was unconstitutional in its entirety, no consequence of its passage could be enforced, and any purported mandate of its passage was void ab initio; [2]-Therefore, &sect; 5524(8) never went out of existence and remained the law; [2]-Section 5524(8) was not inconsistent with the establishment of a statute of limitations for both wrongful death and survival actions beginning upon the date on which the asbestos-harmed person became aware of his or her injury and the cause of the same.</SPAN></P>

Having been caught off guard by the initial accusation, the juvenile had no choice but to talk and was in a classic case of custodial interrogation, and the law required that Miranda warnings be administered and voluntarily waived before the interrogation continued.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2502(b) and 1102.1(c)(1), as it was tailored to protect society from defendant's escalating criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

Upon appeal and remand, the court determined that pursuant to the common law, reversal was required.

Ann. &sect; 1311 et seq., requiring a criminal conviction to disqualify an employee from receipt of retirement benefits, and the disqualification did conflict, due to the employee's lack of a valid criminal conviction, after the crime she pled guilty to was held unconstitutional, given her lack of any other criminal conviction, as she was never charged under any potentially applicable criminal offenses enumerated in the Forfeiture Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board members initially asserted challenges to both a SO and a reorganization ordinance. The SO, which drastically reduced the level of compensation of Board members and altered the method of calculating compensation, became effective, notwithstanding that the reorganization ordinance had not yet been approved or become effective. The court granted summary judgment to the members. In support of an affirmance on appeal, it was opined that the court properly determined that they were &quot;public officers&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 27 with respect to their performance of the appellate function of establishing the agency's final tax assessment. Further, the SO, insofar as it attempted to reduce the salary and emoluments of the members of the Board mid-term, violated &sect; 27. The city did not have authority under 53 Pa. Stat.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 501 et seq., arising from a $ 79,000,000 construction project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the facts of the case established that plaintiff and various subcontractors intentionally submitted inflated and fraudulent bids, proposals, invoices, and change orders for amounts due on other projects under the guise that the worked referenced would be performed at the construction project at issue in the case. The court upheld its award of punitive damages to defendant and rejected plaintiff's contention that its withdrawal of some fraudulent claims prevented an award of punitive damages against it. The court disagreed and held that the withdrawal of some fraudulent claims did not insulate a party against the possibility of a punitive damages award. The court held that it properly found that $ 560,000 in fraudulent bills was still being sought for payment when the case went to verdict. Further, the court held that it properly held it deducted that amount for plaintiff's net award after a judgment was entered in favor of defendant on its counterclaim. The court further held that it properly denied plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees because it was not the substantially prevailing party as required under 73 Pa. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court recommended that its order awarding punitive damages be affirmed and that its order denying all post-trial motions be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a city board of revision of taxes (BRT), filed preliminary objections (POs) to an answer with new matter and counterclaim of defendant city with respect to the BRT's challenge to a salary ordinance (SO) that was passed by the city. The SO drastically reduced the level of compensation of BRT board members and substantially altered the method of calculating compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed a reorganization ordinance (RO) that would become effective on a particular date if ratified by the electorate. It also passed the SO, which became effective upon signing by the mayor. The BRT sought to have the implementation of both ordinances enjoined by the Supreme Court pursuant to its King's Bench authority. That Court exercised such powers over the RO only. The challenge to the SO proceeded through previously-brought litigation, to which the city filed POs and a counterclaim. The court initially noted that it only considered POs in the form of a demurrer pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1028(a)(4), as other issues required resolution of factual issues. The court found the city's claim that it was empowered to abrogate the BRT's quasi-judicial appellate function pursuant to 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13132(c) lacking in merit. Rather, it held that the members of the BRT, in performing the appellate function of establishing the BRT's final tax assessment, were &quot;public officers&quot; within the meaning of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 27. Accordingly, the SO was violative of &sect; 27, such that it was unconstitutional and invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court struck the city's answer with respect to the issues reviewed, and it entered judgment in favor of the members of the BRT in their individual capacity and against the city. All other preliminary objections were overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant charter school sought review of the court's order which reversed the decision of the Board of Trustees to permanently expel appellee student and ordered the disciplinary record regarding the expulsion expunged. The court entered an order directing the school to file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement, which it did.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter stemmed from the filing of the original appeal by the student from the charter school's decision to permanently expel the student, a six-year-old kindergarten student, from the school. The expulsion was the result of the student amassing four suspensions, which required the school's disciplinary committee of the board of trustees to hold an expulsion. The expulsion was based, in part, on a particular suspension in which the student placed his hands on his teacher's thighs and said to his teacher, &quot;I want to make them feel better,&quot; subsequent to his teacher stating that her legs hurt. The teacher classified that as inappropriate touching and the student was suspended for the action. The court held that, in permanently expelling a six-year-old kindergarten student that had only been in school for seven months, the school made a gross abuse of discretion that was not supported by sufficient evidence in the record. The court found that the school's actions were disproportionately excessive in light of the child's age, conduct, and prior history.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court recommended that the appeal be denied.</SPAN></P>

The sentence of death was supported by the evidence and was not so contrary to the evidence as to shock one's sense of justice under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9711.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants had represented a competitor in a suit against plaintiff for misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of a restrictive covenant. That action resulted in a judgment in favor of plaintiff. Plaintiff thereafter brought the underlying suit, which resulted in a jury verdict in favor of defendants. Plaintiff filed a post verdict motion seeking a new trial. The court denied the motion, concluding that the an attorney could not be held liable for gross negligence under the Dragonetti Act unless the jury also found that the attorney initiated or continued the underlying action for an improper purpose. Since the jury found that defendants did not initiate, or continue the underlying lawsuit for a purpose other than that of securing the proper discovery, joinder of parties, or adjudication of the claims on which the proceedings were based, no further deliberations were necessary and the question of gross negligence did not need to be answered. Therefore, the court properly accepted and recorded a verdict based upon the answers to the jury questions and thereafter properly discharged the jury.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the internet publisher was a media defendant who was reporting on one of the most important issues to the public at the time.

In determining the relief sought under Rule 227.1, the court found, inter alia, that the plan and the ordinance did not violate the fundamental law clearly, palpably, plainly so as to leave no doubt or hesitation in the court's mind. In fact, the plan and the ordinance were not in conflict with the purpose of SWMA at all, but rather contained mandates that directly further SWMA's policy. Therefore, they were not unconstitutional or preempted by SWMA. The injury caused by the storm water management facilities was not permanent, as there was a feasible remedy. Accordingly, the proper measure of damages was the cost to install a new piping system together with numerous other associated costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed omnibus pretrial motions seeking a writ of habeas corpus on the charges of attempted homicide, aggravated assault, and criminal attempt-assault of a law enforcement officer. Defendant also filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of the crime of assault of a law enforcement officer, as well as sought to suppress his statements made to the police his identification via a photographic array.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from officers responding to a call with regard to shots being fired near a hotel. A security guard described an individual that had shot at him. The police found defendant in the street matching that description and confronted defendant, who attempted to shoot at one of the officers, but the gun did not discharge. At that point, one of the officers shot defendant. Defendant asserted in his motions for a writ of habeas corpus that the Commonwealth failed to establish a prima facie case of the charges against him. The court disagreed and noted that defendant's ignorance concerning the number of rounds in the gun he was holding did not negate his intent when he purposefully pulled the trigger in an attempt to fire his revolver. Further, in doing so, he took a substantial step toward killing the two responding officers. The court further found defendant's inculpatory statements to the police made at the hospital were admissible since he was five days post-operative, he did not appear to be under the influence of medication, and he did not exhibit signs of discomfort or pain. The court found that the photographic array was not unduly suggestive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the vehicle that defendants were riding in &quot;abruptly&quot; changed lanes without signaling, a police detective decided to follow it. The vehicle parked in a parking lot for a short time, whereupon the detective observed defendant-A pour beer out of the vehicle window. While following the vehicle again, the detective observed a can of beer thrown out of the passenger side window. After the vehicle made counter-surveillance movements down small alleyways, it was stopped. A clear plastic bag containing cocaine was discovered in the vicinity of the center console of the vehicle and defendants were charged. The court found no basis to suppress the evidence. The littering of the beer can, in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3709(a), Allentown, Pa., Codified Ordinances &sect; 725.03, and 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6501, served as a basis to stop the vehicle. Further, the cocaine was observed in plain view pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court found no cause to sever the trials of defendants pursuant to Pa. R. Crim. P. 583, as no prejudice was shown. The fact that defendant-A's defense was conflicting and antagonistic to that of defendant-B did not provide sufficient grounds for severance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A developer purchased property near the estate's property for the purpose of developing a retirement residential subdivision. The TA's sewage facilities plan required that the subdivision and surrounding properties, including the estate's property, be served by the TA's sewer system. The sewage collection for the subdivision was to be provided from an existing sewage pump which was located on the estate property via a previously obtained easement. The developer and estate entered into an agreement for an easement, but it was rejected by the TA. Thereafter, a new developer took over the project, but it was unable to agree on an easement with the estate. Accordingly, the TA commenced its condemnation action and the estate filed preliminary objections thereto. The court found that the easement was the result of a well-developed plan to effectuate a public purpose, and was not primarily for the developer's private interest. Sufficient security was filed by the TA through its bond pursuant to 26 Pa.C.S. &sect; 303(a). The TA was not required to respond to the preliminary objections pursuant to Pa.R.C.P.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the MCOs had paid the city only rates established by Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare from July 1, 2002 through December 30, 2006, the city sought additional reimbursement under Act 68 for emergency services provided to the MCOs' members during that period of time. The court found, inter alia, that the words &quot;all reasonably necessary costs&quot; expressed a clear intent to indemnify the provider of services, which necessarily included the cost of being able to provide the service, i.e. the cost of having an emergency service at the ready. The language &quot;provided during the period of the emergency&quot; limited the recoverable cost to the cost arising from the provision of the emergency care, including the preparedness for it. The limit imposed by the language was a temporal limit, and referred to the cessation of the emergency. The components of the cost needed to be addressed on an item by item basis at the time of trial, or by some additional pretrial ruling that framed the questions with more particularity. The city could meet its burden of going forward by introducing evidence that claims had been made and paid, in other words, by introducing evidence of &quot;clean claims.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court provided an opinion in support of its order denying posttrial motions after a jury found in favor of one plaintiff as to her assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims and against an officer on his counterclaim. The officer had appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer argued, inter alia, that the court erred in asserting personal jurisdiction over him and in failing to grant a mistrial. The injured persons alleged that they were dragged from their parked car and beaten. They alleged that the officer punched one injured person in the face and slammed her facedown into the sidewalk. Despite an initial defect in service, the officer acquiesced in the city's representation, thus giving it the authority to accept service on his behalf, and waived his objections to service through the city's actions in representing him on the merits of the case. Thus, the court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over him. In regard to the injured person's counsel mentioning Rodney King during closing arguments, each juror individually affirmed that he or she was capable of disregarding the comment and remaining impartial in weighing the evidence. Those affirmations, considered together with the curative instruction given by the court, establish that a mistrial was not warranted. While the injured persons may have known that they lacked a judgment at the time they filed their Pa.R.C.P. No. 3118 motion, they did not knowingly raise a frivolous claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court respectfully submitted that the appeal should be quashed or, alternatively, dismissed. The court asserted that its order denying the former officer's post-trial motions was properly entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence imposed following his conviction of, inter alia, possession with intent to deliver cocaine and marijuana. The issues were whether the court properly applied the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9712 and whether a challenge to the constitutionality of the &quot;in close proximity&quot; language of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9712.1 was proper. The court issued an opinion in support of its judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a large-scale drug operation along with his two co-defendants, who were also his brothers. In the kitchen area of an apartment, in which defendant was arrested, were two safes which contained drugs, drug-related items, and one of which, contained a handgun. A bedroom contained drugs, drug-related items, and an assault rifle. A police officer found cocaine in the backseat of the police car where defendant had been sitting. From the spot where defendant was found in the living room, there was no door or barrier blocking access to the kitchen. The den and kitchen comprised a wide open space. The distance between defendant and the pistol found in the safe, in the kitchen, was no more than five feet. There was a tiny little hallway separating defendant from the assault rifle and ammunition for that rifle, located in the bedroom closet. At most it was only 20 to 25 steps from where defendant was found. Accordingly, the court properly applied the mandatory sentencing provision of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9712.1. Defendant's conduct fell squarely within the mandatory sentencing statute; therefore, we decline to address this constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court recommended that its judgment be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner appealed a decision by appellee township board of supervisors that upheld the denial of his application for a sewage permit by appellee sewage enforcement officer; the owner claimed that the denial violated his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the owner originally purchased the land, it had a valid sewage permit for an above ground sand mound system. Thereafter, the owner was granted a zoning permit and a second sewage permit was issued for the property for a similar system. After the owner obtained a zoning permit and finished his construction, he filed a request for new sewage permit. However, because the township determined that the property was not suitable for an on-lot system, the zoning permit was revoked and the sewage permit application was denied. The court found, inter alia, that the owner still had the option to obtain a permit for an alternative septic system. Until that permit was denied, an administrative remedy existed. The board relied on uncontradicted testimony that the soil on the owner's lot was no longer suitable for an above ground system. The board found the owner's lack of due diligence to be a major factor in reaching its decision. The board's conclusions were products of logical reasoning based on the evidence presented. Finally, the record demonstrated that substantial evidence was admitted before the board. Consequently, the owner's constitutional rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board's findings were affirmed, and the owner's appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought a divorce under &sect; 3301(c) of the Divorce Code, 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3301(c), from defendant, and intervenor, the Attorney General, participated in a hearing to determine, on the court's own motion, whether it had authority to grant the requested relief between the parties. The parties were both female and had been married in Massachusetts, which permitted same-sex marriages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married in Massachusetts. Thereafter, plaintiff, a resident of Pennsylvania, sought a divorce. The court held a hearing on whether it had the authority to grant the relief. Initially, the court held that it was proper that it raised the issue regarding its authority and subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte. It noted that relief under the Pennsylvania Divorce Code, 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3101 et seq., could only be obtained by parties who were recognized to be married pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3102 and 3103. The court found that based on 23 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1102 and 1704, it could not grant a divorce to the parties. Although their marriage was considered valid in some states, it was not recognized in Pennsylvania and without a legally recognized marriage, relief under the Divorce Code was unavailable. The court noted that the Full Faith and Credit clause of U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1 did not require Pennsylvania to recognize the marriage. Under a substantive due process analysis, the court concluded that the fundamental right to be married did not contemplate same-sex marriages. The statutes survived the rational basis test, as they were based on a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to bar imposition of the death penalty in response to the Commonwealth's notice that it intended to seek the death penalty under Pa. R. Crim. P. 802. Defendant was charged with criminal homicide, kidnapping for ransom, aggravated indecent assault of a child, and false reports to police, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2501, 2901(a)(1), 3125(b), and 4906(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from the death of his very young daughter due to hypothermia after she was found in a wooded area near railroad tracks. The Commonwealth indicated an intent to seek the death penalty, based on aggravating factors under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9711(d)(5), (6), and (16). Defendant sought to bar the imposition thereof, alleging that he suffered from autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and that such should be viewed in the same light as mental retardation or a defendant under the age of 18 years for purposes of preclusion of the death penalty. The court noted that defendant provided testimony from one psychologist as to the ASD diagnosis. However, the psychologist acknowledged that mental retardation was not an element of autism. Further, defendant knew the difference between right and wrong, and he had been examined over the years by numerous other mental health professionals, none of whom arrived at that diagnosis. The court concluded that defendant did not meet his burden of establishing that he suffered from ASD. Moreover, even if he did, such disorder did not rise to the level of mental illness or mental retardation so as to preclude the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to bar imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendants arose from the shooting deaths of three people. One individual was killed over a drug dispute, and the other two were innocent patrons. The first trial against defendants resulted in a hung jury. After a second trial, defendant-A was convicted of all charges, and the criminal homicides were set at first degree murders. Due to a deadlock by the jury, a mistrial was declared against defendant-B. Thereafter, he was convicted as charged and he was sentenced to the same terms as were imposed on defendant-A. In support of an affirmance on appeal, the court noted that as to defendant-A, it was not an abuse of discretion to deny severance of defendants' cases or to deny defendant-A's untimely request for a line-up. Denial of suppression was proper, there were no evidentiary ruling errors, and challenges to jurors did not violate the Batson requirements. There were no errors in the jury instructions and a mistrial was not warranted. With respect to defendant-B, the court found no basis to suppress a photo array that was not unduly suggestive. There was no double jeopardy violation, and the weight and sufficiency of the evidence supported the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant inmate appealed an order that dismissed his pro se second motion for post-conviction relief (PCR) pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9541 et seq. The inmate had been previously convicted of robbery and possession of an instrument of crime with the intent to employ it criminally, and he was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment. The court submitted an opinion in support of an affirmance on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was found guilty of the various offenses after a jury trial, and his sentence was affirmed on appeal. The inmate filed his second PCR motion while the first one was still pending and unresolved, alleging that he was improperly sentenced. After a lengthy series of appeals and remands of the first PCR motion, the second PCR motion was dismissed. In support of an affirmance on appeal, it was noted that the second PCR motion was filed nearly two years after the date on which the inmate's appeal from his conviction and sentence became final, such that it was clearly untimely under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9545(b)(1). Further, there was no showing that the motion was within any of the exceptions to timeliness under &sect; 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii). Lastly, the filing of the second motion was procedurally barred while the first motion was still pending pursuant to &sect; 9545(b)(2). The court noted that the inmate's substantive reliance on a case precedent to support his sentencing claim was erroneous, as it did not apply retroactively to the inmate's matter.</SPAN></P>
