<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens proposed city ordinances through the initiative and referendum process to place certain restrictions on the City's ability to relocate its city hall facilities and its use of rezoning, eminent domain, and condemnation. Appellee City refused to adopt the ordinances or advance them for public vote. The Johnson District Court, Kansas, ruled in favor of the City and granted its motion for summary judgment. The citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the citizens contended the district court erred in ruling in favor of the City. The supreme court disagreed, finding that the first petition was principally executive or administrative in nature as its prohibition of relocating the city hall facilities was so extensive that it made unavailable more than 90 percent of the City's geographic territory. This had the practical effect of dictating where the City located its city hall facilities. Such a restriction necessarily limited and intruded to a substantial extent into areas of city administration requiring specialized knowledge about city affairs, regulatory requirements, long-range planning, and financing. These were all subject matters typically left to city administrators. The second petition was also administrative and thus excluded under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-3013, as it required the City to take action to not allow other entities to invoke statutory authority granted them by the legislature, which were matters of statewide concern (impact rezoning and eminent domain authority). Thus, the City's refusal to adopt the ordinances or advance them for public vote was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Crawford District Court (Kansas) that convicted him of first-degree premeditated murder, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting a statement made by defendant more than two years before the shooting and erred in permitting the admission of specific instances of defendant's drug dealing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first-degree murder after killing a well-known drug dealer. At trial, a drug task force agent testified that she interviewed defendant earlier as part of a cocaine investigation and defendant told her that he did not sell crack cocaine but that his speciality was robbing and killing people. On review, the court held that defendant's statement was properly admitted under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455 because the statement essentially referred to defendant's sense of identity and did not refer to a specific crime or civil wrong. Further, the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of specific instances of defendant's drug dealing under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455 because the evidence was relevant to establish defendant's knowledge of the value of drugs and defendant's awareness of the amount of money that drug dealers were known to carry. The evidence was also relevant to establish motive and defendant's knowledge of the local drug scene. Any harm arising from this evidence was tempered by a jury instruction that informed jurors that they could only consider the specific crimes evidence to explain defendant's motive and his knowledge of the drug culture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sedgwick District Court, Kansas, convicted defendant of intentional second-degree murder and criminal possession of a firearm related to the death of the victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant conceded that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-2512 did not provide him a right to DNA testing and focused on an equal protection argument by comparing the similarity between premeditated first-degree murder and intentional second-degree murder. The supreme court found that the crimes of premeditated first-degree murder and intentional second-degree murder were distinguished by the premeditation element. The supreme court had characterized premeditation as the defining element of premeditated first-degree murder in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3401(a). In contrast, intentional second-degree murder had no requirement that the defendant think the matter over beforehand. Defendant failed to meet his burden of establishing that he was similarly situated to those who had a right to DNA testing under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-2512, and his equal protection argument failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In each defendants' cases, the district court held that a police officer's search was unconstitutional.

After verifying that there was a warrant for such defendant, he asked defendant step out of the car. The second defendant was sitting in the driver's set. The first defendant was arrested. The officer then searched the car while both defendants stood on a sidewalk near the car. In the car's closed center console, the officer found a items containing drug residue. On appeal, the court determined that Arizona v. Gant controlled and that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2501(c) was unconstitutional. The court determined that the current wording of &sect; 22-2501(c) would permit a search of a vehicle incident to an occupant's or a recent occupant's arrest, even if the purpose of the search was not focused on uncovering evidence only of the crime of arrest. Section 22-2501(c) was thus facially unconstitutional under the U.S. Const. amend. IV and under Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 15. Accordingly, the search violated defendants' rights.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that the State was required to prove that defendant, knowing he was infected with HIV, intentionally engaged in sexual intercourse with the victims with the specific intent to expose them to HIV. It further held that a person of ordinary intelligence would understand what &sect; 21-3435 meant by the term &quot;life threatening; the statute conveyed sufficient definite warning to the citizenry as to the conduct which was proscribed and provided explicit standards for those that applied the law. As such, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.

The Kansas Court of Appeals held that the State failed to carry its burden of proving that defendant was advised of his right to counsel. Review was sought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sheriff officers arrested defendant for driving on a suspended license. At a detention center, defendant was caught trying to discard a pipe, which subsequently tested positive for marijuana. On appeal, defendant claimed that the prior misdemeanor conviction used to elevate the severity level of the offense from a misdemeanor to a felony was unconstitutionally obtained without counsel or a valid waiver of counsel. The State was required to show that defendant's initial waiver was properly obtained after appropriate advice as to the right to counsel, in other words, that the waiver was knowingly and intelligently made. The supreme court agreed with the intermediate appellate court that the State failed to carry its burden. Defendant was entitled to counsel when the municipal court found defendant guilty and sentenced defendant to a prison term, even though the jail time was a condition of probation. The denial of the right to counsel rendered defendant's uncounseled misdemeanor conviction unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The unconstitutional conviction could not be collaterally used in district court for sentence enhancement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that without the inclusion of her juvenile adjudications, her criminal history score would have been different, and her presumptive sentence would have been 19 to 21 months' imprisonment. When defendant was adjudicated, she received all of the process she was due, and she was afforded all of the constitutional protections then required in such proceedings. Before defendant's juvenile adjudications were final, they were prior convictions under the Apprendi exception, and the district court properly included them in her criminal history scoring. Alternatively, defendant argued that the use of any of her prior convictions or adjudications to enhance her sentence violated her rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Essentially, defendant asked the appellate court to accept her prediction that the United States Supreme Court would modify its Apprendi holding to eliminate the express exception for prior convictions, i.e., that the court will someday require all sentence-enhancing facts, including prior convictions, to be pled and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The supreme court declined this invitation to prognosticate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Wyandotte District Court (Kansas) that convicted him of premeditated first-degree murder and criminal discharge of a firearm at an occupied vehicle, arguing that an ex parte conversation between a juror and the judge violated his right to be present all critical stages of trial under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3405(1) and that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on reckless second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the jury began deliberating, a juror approached the judge regarding the competency of another juror. The judge notified the parties of the conversation and held a hearing before directing the jury to continue its deliberations. On review, the court held that, although the trial judge erred in speaking with the juror without the presence of counsel and defendant, the error was harmless because the strength of the prosecution's case was great. Defendant was seen in a car near the shooting, he confessed and took sole responsibility for the shooting, and physical evidence corroborated his confession. The ex parte communication did not involve a critical aspect of the trial, and the trial judge mitigated any harm by conducting a hearing with counsel and defendant present before the jury resumed deliberations following the ex parte contact. Further, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on reckless second-degree murder as a lesser included offense of premeditated first-degree murder because, where defendant pointed a gun at someone in a vehicle and fired numerous rounds, it was logical to conclude that his actions were intentional and not merely reckless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners sought review of a judgment from the Coffey District Court (Kansas), which, after denying their motion to stay proceedings in their appeal from an appraisers' award in an eminent domain proceeding, dismissed the action for lack of prosecution when the property owners and their counsel failed to appear for trial. The district court held counsel in contempt and levied costs and fees against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners sought to stay the proceedings in the district court pending the outcome of a constitutional challenge filed in federal court. After the district court denied their motion to stay proceedings, they filed a docketing statement with the clerk of the appellate courts. Although they acknowledged in their docketing statement that the order was not final, they did not perfect an interlocutory appeal under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-2102(c) (2007 Supp.). The court held that the district court did not lose jurisdiction to proceed with the trial when the property owners filed their docketing statement with the clerk of the appellate courts. The court observed that piecemeal appeals were undesirable and that the collateral order doctrine was a very narrow exception to the final decision requirement. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to stay. The contempt order against counsel was void because the district court failed to comply with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-1203 when it did not include counsel's statement of the reasons for his absence in the journal entry; the lack of such a statement was a jurisdictional defect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's dismissal of the appeal from the appraisers' award. The court reversed the contempt order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine and placed on probation. He appealed from one of the conditions of his probation, which required him to submit to random, suspicionless searches by community corrections or law enforcement officers. The Kansas Court of Appeals held that this condition was unconstitutional and unenforceable. The State petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State argued that the appellate court's decision would thwart efforts by law enforcement officers to rehabilitate probationers since those officers would be required to have reasonable suspicion to search. Because defendant was discharged while the case was pending before the supreme court, his counsel filed a notice of mootness. The supreme court held that although defendant was no longer subject to the conditions of probation in this case, the question as to the constitutionality of suspicionless searches was an issue that was capable of repetition, yet evading review. The supreme court further found that because parolees in Kansas had an expectation that they would not be subjected to suspicionless searches, it logically followed that because probationers had a greater expectation of privacy than parolees, searches of probationers in Kansas must also be based on a reasonable suspicion. Thus, the condition of defendant's probation subjecting him to random, nonconsensual, suspicionless searches violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; XV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the consumers contended the appellate court erred in reversing the district court's decision. The supreme court agreed, finding that although the appellate court correctly acknowledged that the transaction involved in this case was subject to the statutory provisions of Kan. Stat.

The implied warranty of merchantability applied to the transaction as a matter of law under the statue, but the resolution of what the extent of the dealer's obligation was under the warranty was a factual determination. The attempt by the appellate court to convert this question into a legal determination amounted to error. Further, the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to establish that the defect in the air conditioner existed at the time of sale. And under the plain language of Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in entering evidence about defendant's prior sexual abuse of two witnesses. The supreme court agreed, finding that although the fact that defendant molested other young girls in the past shed light on the existence of intent, absence of mistake or accident was not actually in issue. The State's introduction of evidence about defendant's hypothesis during his law enforcement interview that the victim could have become confused by certain other incidents of nonsexual touching was insufficient to support admission of contrary evidence by the State. Under these circumstances, the State could not open the door for itself to put the witnesses on the stand to rebut an innocent explanation advanced by defendant. The evidence it introduced from his interview bore no relationship to the defense theory of the case at trial. Under the signature standard, it was error to admit this evidence. As there was no physical evidence corroborating the victim's account, the State's entire case hinged entirely on the victim's credibility; thus, the admission of the evidence was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal. On appeal from the summary denial of his motion, defendant argued that the district court erred and/or abused its discretion in summarily denying the motion because: (1) res judicata was inapplicable to motions to correct illegal sentence; and (2) summary disposition was an inappropriate procedure for handling motions to correct illegal sentence. The appellate court concluded that res judicata applied to motions to correct illegal sentence filed pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3504. In this case, the question had been raised on direct appeal. Defendant next argued that summary denial was an inappropriate disposition of a motion filed pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3504(1); however, the appellate court concluded that the preliminary examination procedure was appropriate. The district court properly denied the motion summarily upon finding the motion to be barred on the basis of res judicata.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural mother lied to the father about her pregnancy and the child's birth.

When the child was six months old, the father learned the truth about the baby, and he instituted proceedings to set aside the adoption. The district court held that the father's effort to set aside the adoption decree was time-barred, under the 30-day time limit of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2213. The court agreed that the decree could not be set aside based on newly discovered evidence, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-260(b)(2), because the father could have discovered the child with minimal diligence. The decree could also not be set aside on the ground of fraud, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-260(b)(3), because the mother did not qualify as an adverse party. The father's biological relationship with the child did not guarantee a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Const. amend.

Defendant should have been sentenced to a severity level four drug felony for his conviction of possession of pseudoephedrine rather than a severity level one under Kansas' identical offense sentencing doctrine because K.S.A. 65-7006(a) and K.S.A. 65-4152(a)(3) contained overlapping, identical elements relating to the knowing possession of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine with the intent to manufacture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended that various canons of the Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct (Code), set forth in Kan. Sup. Ct.

I, relating to whether judicial candidates could publicly announce their views on legal and political issues. The federal district court granted a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the judicial canons in question. On appeal, the court of appeals determined that plaintiffs' claims rested on sufficiently novel and determinative questions of state law that involved important state policy interests. The court had jurisdiction to answer certified questions, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-3201. The court recommended revisions to the Code. A judicial candidate might violate Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 601A, Canon 5A(3)(d)(i) and (ii), by answering a questionnaire asking for his or her views on disputed legal and political issues, depending on the questions asked. Additionally, a judicial candidate violated Kan. Sup. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences for felony murder and aiding and abetting a kidnapping, but the supreme court affirmed, concluding that the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's request to instruct on compulsion; that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting three postmortem photographs of the victim's body; that the prosecutor did not commit reversible misconduct when using a sports team analogy to explain the concept of aiding and abetting to the jury; and that the trial court did not erroneously impose an enhanced sentence based upon prior criminal history without requiring those crimes be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In regard to the compulsion instruction, there was at least one occasion of the many that the State argued where the alleged coercion or duress was noncontinuous and non-imminent. That overlapped with defendant's reasonable opportunity to escape or withdraw from the criminal activity. Nothing prevented defendant from leaving the camp when he was out of another homeless person's sight for at least 10 minutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated criminal cases, defendant appealed judgments from Edwards district court, Kansas, convicting him of three counts of first-degree murder; one count each of aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and felony theft; and two counts of misdemeanor theft. Defendant challenged Kansas' &quot;hard 40&quot; sentencing scheme and a sentence enhancement based on his commission of a heinous, atrocious, or cruel crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of executing his wife, her father, and her boyfriend. Coworkers testified that defendant and his wife were splitting up, that he had previously battered her, and that he threatened to kill her. The appeals court held that the district court erred, due a subsequent change in the law, by admitting evidence of marital discord independent of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455. However, applying &sect; 60-455 retroactively, the appeals court held that the marital discord evidence was material and admissible to prove defendant's motive--rage and jealousy--for committing the triple murder. Defendant was not entitled to a voluntary manslaughter instruction because he was unable to show provocation, as his defense was that he did not enter the marital home on the day of the killings. The wife's hearsay statements to a police officer, to whom she gave defendant's guns several hours before she was killed, were properly admitted under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-460(d)(3). The evidence was insufficient to convict for aggravated burglary under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3716, as defendant still had legal access to the marital domicile. Defendant's enhanced capital murder sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Defendant's murder, aggravated robbery, felony theft, and misdemeanor theft convictions and their corresponding sentences were affirmed.

He also was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction for voluntary manslaughter under the alternative means of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3403(b).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied a stepparent adoption under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2136(d) (2007 Supp.), and the Court of Appeals of Kansas affirmed, holding that the natural father's consent was necessary because he had performed his parental duties during the two years preceding the adoption petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stepfather argued that the district court and appellate court majority misinterpreted a 2006 amendment to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2136(d), which stated that the court could consider the best interests of a child and the fitness of a nonconsenting parent in determining whether a stepparent adoption should be granted. The court affirmed the interpretation of the lower courts. The plain language, both before and after the 2006 amendment, stated that the consent of a known father had to be given to a stepparent adoption unless the father failed or refused to assume the duties of a parent for two consecutive years  preceding the petition. The best interests provision in the amendment did not permit a court to override the requirement of mandatory consent when a natural parent had assumed his or her parental responsibilities. Because the natural father had assumed a sufficient level of parental responsibility, his rights as a parent were entitled to constitutional protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. He had not consented to the adoption in this case, and his decision to withhold his consent could not be overridden absent compelling circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed his mother by repeatedly stomping on her and then he set fire to her body. Defendant contended that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence statements he made to authorities before he was given the warnings required by Miranda. Defendant's spontaneous statements made to authorities in the interrogation room before he was verbally Mirandized were admissible because they were made before interrogation and before the Miranda safeguards were triggered. The court agreed that admission of evidence of defendant's prior crimes and civil wrongs violated Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455. However, the admission was not inconsistent with substantial justice given the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. Regarding the imposition of the hard 50 life sentence, defendant challenged the trial court's finding under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4636(f) that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner. The court found no abuse of discretion in the sentencing court's decision that the aggravating circumstance outweighed defendant's mitigators.

The court held that the detention was permissible under the Fourth Amendment and Kan. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Rice District Court, Kansas, convicted defendant of premeditated, first-degree murder and criminal possession of a firearm. The court imposed sentences of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for 25 years for the murder conviction and 9 months' imprisonment for the firearm offense, to be served consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the district court erred by not instructing the jury on voluntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of first-degree murder, and by providing an instruction that allegedly shifted the burden of proof to defendant to prove his innocence. The supreme court disagreed, finding first that the evidence of an argument between defendant and the victim before the victim's death failed to demonstrate any legally sufficient provocation that would have warranted an instruction on voluntary manslaughter. When the victim told defendant to calm down, defendant responded by shooting him five times, including three times in the head. As such, the district court did not err when it instructed the jury on only second-degree murder as a lesser included offense of premeditated, first-degree murder as the evidence did not justify a conviction for voluntary manslaughter. Even if the instruction was in some way erroneous, any possible error was invited by defendant, who proposed the exact language in question before trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon his release, defendant completed a sex offender registration form. He filed no additional registration forms. Nearly four months later, he was arrested for a domestic battery. The following month, defendant was sent a registered letter at the address provided on the registration form.

Six months later, the Kansas Legislature changed violation of the registration statute from a severity-level 10 nonperson felony to a severity level 5 person felony under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4903 (Supp. 2006). Nearly five months after the change defendant was charged with violating &sect; 22-4904, as a severity level 5 person felony.

A doctor testified by deposition that the employee had an instability in the right wrist that was additional to a carpal tunnel injury noted by other experts. The court found no basis for modifying the disability rating. Neither the ALJ nor the Board had disregarded the doctor's diagnosis, and the employee made no showing that bias, passion, or prejudice played a role in the decisions. At least five medical consultants, including the doctor, had examined the employee as a consequence of the pain she reported. Four of them made no mention of wrist instability. The plain language of the workers compensation statutes created no parallel-injury rule and established a rebuttable presumption that a claimant was incapable of engaging in substantial and gainful employment. The record did not support the employee's assertion that the parallel injuries to her arms made her work more challenging or limited her tasks more than an injury to either arm alone would have done.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A witness, who was riding his bicycle toward a convenience store, heard gunfire and smelled gun powder. The store's assistant manager died, and money was found to be missing from the store. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence of his termination from the store for stealing was not relevant to prove motive. Nevertheless, when viewed through the knowledge factor of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455, the evidence in the instant case revealed that the crimes were most likely committed by someone with intimate knowledge of the store operations. Moreover, the evidence was not more prejudicial than it was probative because defendant was acquitted of other honesty-based crimes and a theft. Defendant also argued that his trial should have been severed from that of his co-defendant's because of antagonistic defenses. The co-defendant's testimony, however, did not establish that defendant and the co-defendant had antagonistic defenses. Both denied involvement in the robbery and murder, and neither implicated the other. Finally, the trial court did not violate defendant's due process and jury trial rights by failing to instruct the jury on lesser included homicides and robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Kansas) affirming appellant's juvenile adjudication for aggravated sexual battery, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-727 (Supp. 2005), and being a minor in possession of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facts leading up to the charges allegedly involved a sexually suggestive confrontation between appellant and a neighbor. Appellant's request for a jury trial was denied. Appellant claimed that he should have received a jury trial and he argued that sweeping changes to juvenile justice procedures in Kansas merited renewed scrutiny under applicable constitutional protections. Appellant's first argument was made pursuant to the Sixth Amendment. The supreme court agreed with appellant because the proceedings under the Revised Kansas Juvenile Justice Code (KJJC), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-2301 et seq. (Supp. 2006), were now more akin to criminal proceedings. Appellant also asserted that he had a right to a jury trial under Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect;&sect; 1, 5, and 10. The supreme court noted that the KJJC repeatedly referred to its proceedings as a prosecution. The proceedings under the KJJC fit within the meaning of the phrase &quot;all prosecutions&quot; as set forth in &sect; 10, and juveniles had a right to a jury trial under the Kansas Constitution. Finally, the supreme court noted that the right to a jury trial was new rule of procedure that did not operate retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was reversed and remanded for a new trial before a jury.</SPAN></P>

In reversing, the court held first that defendant was seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 15 after an officer pulled behind the car, blocked it, and activated emergency lights. The court also held, contrary to the court of appeals ruling, that U.S. Supreme Court case law in the context of a warranted home search did not allow law enforcement officers to expand the scope of a traffic stop to include a search not related to the purpose of the stop, even if a detainee gave permission for the search. Rather, the court continued to adhere to the long-standing rule that consensual searches during the period of a detention for a traffic stop were invalid under the Fourth Amendment and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 15. Therefore, evidence from the search of defendant's purse was properly suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was an illegal seizure of his person under the Fourth Amendment because the initial traffic stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion that defendant had committed a traffic violation. The supreme court found that the evidence supported a conclusion that the encounter between defendant and police officer was not voluntary. It was clear from the evidence that defendant failed to give the warning proscribed by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1548. Defendant did not signal 100 feet before making his turn. The officer testified that he believed that defendant was committing a traffic offense, and under Kansas law, the officer was authorized to stop defendant for such an offense even though that stop may have been pretextual. The officer observed defendant violated Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1548 and as such, he had probable cause to stop defendant for that violation. Defendant's two additional arguments were not addressed by the court of appeals and were not included in the State's petition for review. Thus, the court of appeals had to consider the remaining issues on remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed, and the district court's denial of the motion to suppress was affirmed; the case was remanded to the court of appeals for consideration of the two remaining issues raised and not resolved in defendant's original appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) convicted defendant of capital murder, premeditated first-degree murder, aggravated burglary, criminal possession of a firearm, and felony theft. He was sentenced to death for capital murder, with consecutive sentences of life imprisonment for premeditated first-degree murder, 51 months for aggravated burglary, 9 months for criminal possession of a firearm, and 7 months for felony theft. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for the premeditated first-degree murder of one victim under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3401(a) was necessarily proved once the capital murder of both victims under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3439(a)(6) was proved. Thus, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3107(2)(d), defendant's convictions were multiplicitous in the absence of clear and unambiguous legislative intent authorizing multiple prosecutions for the same conduct. So, when a plain reading of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3439(a)(6) and its legislative history did not reveal the legislature's intent to override the acknowledged reach of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3107(2)(d), the supreme court set aside defendant's first-degree premeditated murder conviction because it was multiplicitous with his capital murder conviction and, therefore, in violation of the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 10. The supreme court also set aside defendant's death sentence and remanded his case to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing, because the trial court's instructions to the jury did not inform the jurors that they did not have to unanimously agree regarding the existence of mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed, except for the crime of premeditated murder, which was reversed. The imposition of the death penalty was set aside, and the case was remanded to the trial court for another sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three consolidated original actions in mandamus against respondent judges were prompted by subpoenas duces tecum issued by a Sedgwick County, Kansas, grand jury summoned in response to a citizen petition under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3301, which called for investigation of alleged illegal abortions and other violations by petitioner doctor and others performing professional services at petitioner health care company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor and health care company challenged the constitutionality of the citizen-petition grand jury statutes, and petitioner Kansas Attorney General asserted that a grand jury had no authority to issue a subpoena duces tecum. The supreme court found that the judiciary was to assume the oversight of the grand jury once a petition was filed. Any claim that the process was being abused did not follow from an unconstitutional legislative invasion of the judicial or executive function. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3008(1), grand juries possessed the authority to issue subpoenas duces tecum. The district court had to assess whether each of the subpoenas were relevant. It had to assess the degree of need the grand jury had in obtaining the material described in each subpoena and to balance that need against the burden imposed upon the doctor and health care company. The district court had to make sure that the grand jury had not engaged in an arbitrary fishing expedition and that the targets were not selected and subpoenas issued out of malice or with intent to harass. The district court had to consider the competing interests of the State and the patients and apply a balancing test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sought review of an order from the Shawnee District Court (Kansas), which upheld an order from defendant, the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System (KPERS), suspending his retirement payments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1978, the employee worked for a county sheriff's department and participated in the Kansas Police and Firemen's Retirement System (KP&amp;F). Between 1996 and 2002, he worked as the chief of police for a city. In 2001, the city switched from KPERS to KP&amp;F, and his participation switched as well. When he retired in 2003, he began to draw his KP&amp;F retirement benefits. He was later elected county sheriff. Because of the annual earnings cap in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-4957(5) (Supp. 2007), administrators of KPERS, which oversaw KP&amp;F, suspended his retirement payments. The KPERS Board and the trial court upheld the decision. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in interpreting &sect; 74-4957(5). The statute was not void for vagueness. Because the court could not conclude that the word &quot;during&quot; or the statutory subsection in which it appeared was ambiguous, it certainly could not conclude that either was constitutionally vague. The statute did not violate the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, because the 1994 replacement of a time limitation with an earnings limitation constituted an exchange with offsetting benefits and detriments for workers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judicial trigger provision, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4015(i), sought an unconstitutional remedy that violated the separation of powers doctrine because a lawsuit under the provision did not present an actual case or controversy, but sought an advisory opinion. The provision also purported to make the court an advisor to the legislature, thereby usurping the legislature's duty to make a preliminary judgment on the constitutionality of inoperative legislative provisions. Thus, the legislature violated the separation of powers doctrine by directing the Attorney General to file an action challenging the constitutionality of the funeral protest provisions of the Kansas Funeral Privacy Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4015 et seq. The judicial trigger provision could not be severed from the Act as severance would have broadened the effect of the Act in a manner contrary to the express directions of the legislature. The legislature directed that the provisions became operative if and when determined constitutional. That determination had not been made, and it violated the separation of powers doctrine to make the provisions operative in a manner contrary to the legislature' explicit directions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years for the murder and 131 months' imprisonment for the conspiracy. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that because there was insufficient evidence to support an aiding and abetting instruction, the trial court erred when it overruled his objection to giving it. The supreme court disagreed. In examining the evidence, defendant pointed to the State's evidence that he was the shooter, suggesting that based on that evidence, the jury could not have concluded that the accomplice was the shooter and defendant therefore the aider and abettor. As the State noted, however, while its prosecution theory was that defendant was the shooter, the entire defense was that the accomplice was the shooter. The defense itself elicited testimony indicating that the accomplice confessed to another inmate about being the shooter. There was also testimony from which the jury could have concluded that defendant aided and abetted the accomplice as the shooter because defendant enlisted the accomplice to help with the crime. The aiding and abetting instruction was proper because the jury reasonably could have concluded from the totality of the evidence that defendant was an aider or abettor to the accomplice, even though the State's theory was that defendant was the principal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The questions on review were, inter alia, whether the Department was permitted to decide the merits of the driver's constitutional challenge in the administrative hearing on license suspension; and whether a meritorious constitutional challenge to the underlying traffic stop required the district court to apply the exclusionary rule and reverse the license suspension. In view of the fact that a driver's license was a privilege rather than a right, the supreme court held that the exclusion of U.S. Const. amend. IV and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 15 issues from a Department decision in administrative suspension hearings under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1020(h)(2)(A)-(H) did not violate procedural due process. The supreme court agreed with the driver that the arresting officer misunderstood and misapplied the ordinance regarding how many rear brake lights on a vehicle had to be functioning and thus lacked constitutional authority to stop the driver; however, the balance between the benefits and costs of application of the exclusionary rule, when employed in the driver's license suspension proceedings, tipped in favor of the Department and against the driver.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that: (1) the district court's order for the city to reopen the hiring process and apply a meaningful veteran's preference was the correct remedy because the city retained discretion in applying the veteran's preference; (2) the district court's refusal to declare the employees &quot;competent&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 73-201 was proper because such a ruling would have been neither legally nor factually supportable; (3) &sect; 73-201 did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Kan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a sixteen-year-old, was tried as an adult and convicted of felony murder and criminal discharge of a firearm at an occupied vehicle. On appeal, he complained of the prosecutor's comments in opening statement and closing arguments. The Supreme Court of Kansas held that the prosecutor did not exceed the permissible latitude. Defendant claimed that the district court erred by overruling his objection to combining the preliminary hearing with the adult certification hearing. However, any conditions placed upon defendant's exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights were not the result of combined proceeding. A remand for a new certification hearing was unwarranted. The State's proof was sufficient to support adult certification. Defendant was not entitled to reversal of his convictions for the court's violation of the statutory parental notification provisions; he failed to claim prejudice due to his mother's absence. The district court did not err by giving an Allen-type jury instruction. His convictions for felony murder and criminal discharge of a firearm at an occupied vehicle were not multiplicitous. Defendant received a fundamentally fair trial.</SPAN></P>

The donor sued for determination of his paternity. The district court sustained the mother's motion to dismiss, ruling that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1114(f) was controlling and constitutional. The donor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The donor argued, inter alia, that the requirement of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1114(f) that any opt-out agreement between an unmarried mother and a known sperm donor be &quot;in writing&quot; resulted in an equal protection violation. The supreme court disagreed. Section 38-1114(f) envisioned that both married and unmarried women could become parents without engaging in sexual intercourse, either because of personal choice or because a husband or partner was infertile, impotent, or ill. It encouraged men who were able and willing to donate sperm to such women by protecting the men from later unwanted claims for support from the mothers or the children. It protected women recipients as well, preventing potential claims of donors to parental rights and responsibilities, in the absence of an agreement. The requirement that any such agreement be in writing enhanced predictability, clarity, and enforceability. If the parties desired an arrangement different from the statutory norm, they were free to provide for it, as long as they did so in writing. Therefore, the application of &sect; 38-1114(f) to the donor did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The felony of attempted rape also could serve as the basis for the felony murder, and an attempt did not require penetration. Such evidence was ample. The victim was found blindfolded, lying face up on the floor of her apartment. Her legs were spread a couple of feet apart, and her dress was pulled up to her armpits.  Evidence also revealed her wrists had been bound, and her panty hose had been wadded up and cast aside. The coroner essentially opined that she had been sexually assaulted. Testimony established that two partially smoked cigarettes containing only defendant's DNA were found in an ashtray in the apartment near the victim's body.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The KDOR entered the assessment based on its finding that the taxpayer failed to add back to his adjusted gross income all contributions to the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System (KPERS) that were picked up by his employer. The court determined that the issue was whether Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-32,117(b)(vi), which required that certain employee contributions to the KPERS be added back to adjusted gross income for purposes of Kansas income taxation, was facially unconstitutional. The taxpayer argued that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Kansas Constitutions because certain other public employees were not subject to Kansas income tax on contributions to their retirement plans. The court ruled that the statute was constitutional. The taxpayer failed to demonstrate that all public employees were arguably indistinguishable. The add-back provision did not create a classification that resulted in disparate treatment of similarly situated individuals. Also, the proposed class of &quot;all public employees&quot; was far too broad in defining those who were similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals of Kansas reversed without remand a district court's finding that an adoption consent substantially complied with the adoption statutes and decision to terminate a mother's parental rights and grant parental rights to adoptive parents. The appeals court held that the consent did not comply with the Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 53-501 et. seq. Further review followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural mother signed a consent to adoption. The form was taken to a notary who completed the acknowledgement outside the mother's presence. The mother also delivered the newborn to the adoptive parents. Before the adoption was final, mother moved to withdraw her consent, prompting a 2-day hearing. The district court applied the doctrine of substantial compliance to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2114, denied the mother's motion, and granted the adoption. Most of the district court's finding was supported by substantial competent evidence, e.g., regarding the mother's signing the consent and her understanding of what she was signing. The district court correctly found that the adoptive parents met their burden on the issue of the mother's signature and that the mother had the burden to rebut that evidence, which she failed to do. However, the district court erred in shifting the burden of proving involuntary consent to the mother after her signature was established. A remand was needed to decide if the consent was voluntary. Substantial evidence supported the finding that the adoptive parents were conmon-law husband and wife, and the district court had jurisdiction to grant the adoption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals. The court affirmed the judgment of the district court, in part, finding that the district court correctly applied the substantial compliance doctrine to find the mother signed the consent, but the court remanded the matter to the district court to determine if the mother's consent was voluntary.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-520.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district, township, and owner of part of the annexed property contested the City's efforts to unilaterally annex the district. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to the City and remanded the case with directions to grant summary judgment to the owner, district, and township. The court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-520(c) barred the City's unilateral annexation of part of the district; therefore, because the City failed to proceed in a legislatively authorized way, via a county approval annexation under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-521, its annexation was a nullity. The owner was not estopped by its predecessors' consents from asserting Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-520(c). The court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the state to intervene. The court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-520(c) had a rational basis and did not violate Kan. Const. art. 12, &sect; 5(a) but operated uniformly to all cities in the vicinity of all 33 improvement districts. The court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;12-536 did not limit the application of Kan. Stat. Ann.&nbsp;&sect; 12-520(c) to annexation cases without landowner consent and, thus, did not bar an action contesting annexation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated indecent liberties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State argued that the child victim's statements were admissible because defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the victim during the preliminary hearing. The supreme court disagreed, finding first that Crawford's constitutional principles applied to defendant's direct appeal because it was pending when Crawford was decided. Further, the limitation of defendant's cross-examination caused by the victim's inability to continue when she became upset and started crying due to the questioning prohibited defendant from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination aimed at exposing facts from which the jury could have drawn inferences about the victim's reliability. Because the victim's statements were critical to the prosecution's case in that there were no eyewitnesses or physical evidence to establish the abuse alleged by the victim, and because any evidence of the victim's motive may have had a substantial impact on the jury because the case turned on whether the jury believed the victim's accusations or defendant's denial, the erroneous admission of the victim's statements in violation of defendant's right to confrontation was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the district court's failure to provide a unanimity instruction requiring unanimous agreement on a specific act for a particular count was reversible error because it was a multiple acts case, as defendant's conduct involved different times and different locations, demonstrating acts that were separate and distinct from each other. Accepting a witness' testimony that the victims told her of incidents at five different locations, potentially 20 different acts or offenses were committed, but defendant was charged with only eight. There were some discrepancies between the victims, some discrepancies between the victims and the witness, and some inconsistencies in one victim's statements. There was a real possibility that the jury would have returned a different verdict if the unanimity instruction had been given. The court further held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3506(a)(1) was constitutional because it implicated the legitimate goal of protecting the wellbeing of children from adult sexual predators.</SPAN></P>

The Douglas County District Court (Kansas) denied the bar owner's motion for a temporary injunction, denied his motion to reconsider, and denied his petition. The bar owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ordinance No. 7782 prohibited smoking in public places and places of employment and imposed certain obligations upon the owner, manager, or other person having control of such building or other areas where smoking was prohibited. The bar owner argued that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and preempted by state law. Under the Home Rule Amendment to the Kansas Constitution, Kan. Const. art. 12, &sect; 5, the appellate court determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4010 did not preempt the ordinance because there was no conflict between state and local law since (1) under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-4010 and 21-4013, the legislature invited cities to regulate smoking in public places to the maximum extent possible, and (2) both the state and local laws were prohibitory. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague, because its &quot;has knowledge&quot; requirement adequately stated the requisite intent and it sufficiently specified the type of conduct prohibited and the requisite level of enforcement by a club owner. Finally, the district court properly denied temporary and permanent injunctive relief because the bar owner's arguments were properly rejected on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally sentenced to 150 months in prison with 36 months of post-release supervision after he was convicted of aggravated burglary and aggravated battery. After Apprendi was decided, defendant was resentenced to 77 months in prison and 36 months of post-release supervision. Defendant argued that because he had already served 32 months in prison beyond his 77-month sentence, he should receive credit toward his post-release supervision. On appeal, the court disagreed. The court held that post-release supervision was a separate segment of the sentence and any credit for time spent in confinement was credited against time spent incarcerated, not against post-release supervision. Defendant cited no statute or regulation allowing penal credit to be applied to the period of post-release supervision. The trial court's ruling did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 10 because a subsequent change in the law occurred between defendant's sentencing and resentencing that decreased his term of imprisonment and he was not subjected to an increased term of imprisonment or post-release supervision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district acquired the property in 1947, but it was subject to a reversionary interest. The school district used and maintained the property for over 50 years. During those years, the school district constructed substantial improvements on the property. Later, it sought to bring an eminent domain action to acquire the reversionary interest under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-8212a(b). The owner contended that this was unconstitutional, and the district court agreed. This appeal followed. In reversing, the supreme court held that the Kansas Legislature deemed that it was in the public interest for the school district to protect its public investment against a reversionary interest by authorizing condemnation of the reversionary interest. The requirement that a taking be made for a &quot;public purpose&quot; under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments was fulfilled by the two conditions set forth in &sect; 72-8212a(b). The provisions of &sect; 72-8212a were not unconstitutional, and a public purpose existed for the condemnation action filed by the school district.

The State called a detective, the officer who investigated the victim's murder, as a witness. Defendant acknowledged that his exculpatory statements to the detective were hearsay, but he argued that the trial court violated his right to a fair trial by excluding those statements when it allowed three other witnesses to testify as to incriminating statements that he made to them regarding the murder. The conflicting statements in defendant's case were made in different contexts to different people at different times. Moreover, the State did not attempt to offer any evidence relating to the detective's interrogation of defendant. The evidence was an attempt to offer the exculpatory hearsay statements by defendant into evidence without allowing the State an opportunity to cross-examine defendant with regard to those statements. Also, defendant only attempted to offer his exculpatory statements in order to counter the impact of incriminating statements made by the other witnesses at the trial. Thus, the trial court did not err when it excluded the exculpatory statements defendant made to the detective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his first-degree murder conviction and hard 40 sentence, but the supreme court affirmed, stating that although the excerpts from the prosecutor's closing argument constituted prosecutorial misconduct, the comments did not deny defendant a fair trial. When the prosecutor's comments were viewed in the context of the whole trial, the errors were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The State's case against defendant did not turn on the fact that defendant remained silent after he was charged with the crime. Instead, it was based on a number of pieces of evidence, including the fact that his DNA matched that of the trail of blood drops found surrounding the victim's body and leading from her residence, that he provided inconsistent statements to the police officers, and that he had acknowledged his participation in the victim's murder to his wife. The admission of certain photographs were appropriate because each highlighted a different injury or a different aspect of an injury that the pathologist found relevant to the victim's cause and manner of death. The sentence was appropriate, in part because the victim was in &quot;extreme fear&quot; during the attack.</SPAN></P>

The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit submitted a certified question regarding the homestead exemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified question asked whether a bankruptcy debtor could claim the homestead exemption allowed by Kan. Stat.

On review, the bankruptcy trustee asserted that the debtors could not claim the homestead exemption because the real estate was owned by a trust rather than the debtors. Disagreeing with the trustee, the supreme court answered yes to the certified question and concluded that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy debtor could claim the homestead exemption allowed by &sect; 60-2301 even though the real property was transferred to a self-settled, living, revocable trust prior to the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy debtors were both the settlors and a beneficiaries of the trust. The supreme court broadly interpreted &sect; 60-2301 to include occupants of real estate who held any type of interest, including an equitable interest in the real property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the attorney was representing a corporate client, he wrote letters to opposing counsel regarding a conflict of interest. Copies of one of the letters were sent to government officials. As a result, a disciplinary proceeding was instituted. A hearing panel recommended censure. In adopting this recommendation, the supreme court held that the attorney violated Kan. R. Prof. Conduct 4.4 because the publication of the letter was meant to embarrass opposing counsel. The attorney's subjective motive or purpose was relevant, but not determinative, in deciding whether Rule 4.4 had been violated. Next, Rule 4.4 was not limited only to protecting the rights of lay persons. Also, the attorney violated Kan. R. Prof. Conduct 8.4(d) by publishing the letter because it interfered a public records request and caused a loss of clients. Kan. R. Prof. Conduct 8.4(d) and Kan. R. Prof. Conduct 4.4 were not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Since the attorney finally complied with Kan. R. Prof. Conduct 8.3 by reporting the conflict of interest, there was no violation of that rule. Finally, the recommended sanction was within the applicable guidelines, and it was consistent with prior precedent.</SPAN></P>

There was no contention that the photographs showed unnecessary autopsy procedures, i.e., the gruesome nature of the photographs was caused by the gruesome manner in which the wounds were inflicted, not because the body was altered after the fact. There were a number of photographs, many of which appeared to depict more than one wound. However, the doctor testified that each photograph gave a clearer view of a particular wound, notwithstanding that other wounds might have been visible in the photograph. In addition, the district court did not err in denying admission of a police evidence custody receipt because the inconsistency in the document's contents negated any trustworthiness emanating from its preparation in the regular course of business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee suffered a repetitive use injury to his left shoulder due to his employment. Because of the injury to his left shoulder and the restrictions associated with his treatment, the employee began using only his right arm to perform all of his job duties, and as a result he began experiencing pain in his right shoulder. On appeal of the appellate court's decision, the court held that the Board erroneously interpreted and applied the secondary injury rule, as it placed undue emphasis on a physician's testimony regarding the employee's work activities without considering the physician's testimony linking the injury to the employee's right shoulder with the injury to his left shoulder. The record contained uncontrovertible evidence establishing that the injury to the right shoulder was caused by overcompensating for the injury to his left shoulder. The court further held that the disability in both of the employee's arms was the result of a single injury, and because the employee suffered from the loss of both arms, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-510c(a)(2) established a rebuttable presumption that he was permanently, totally disabled.</SPAN></P>

The issue on appeal was whether the trial court's disqualification order was appealable pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-2102(a)(4) under the collateral order doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the former partner had a substantial relationship with the law firm and that disqualification was necessary under Kan. R. Prof. Conduct 1.9(a). The business unsuccessfully applied, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-2101(b), for permission to take an interlocutory appeal. It then filed a notice of appeal; the state appellate court ordered the parties to address whether Skahan v. Powell, applying the collateral order doctrine to retain the appeal of an order disqualifying counsel, should be reconsidered, and whether Parker v. Volswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft, suggesting that an interlocutory appeal was the only immediate remedy for the business, applied to prevent an appeal. The case was transferred to the state supreme court, and it dismissed. The disqualification motion arose because the attorney might be a witness, meaning that the merits of the motion were inextricably intertwined with the merits of the case. Thus, there was no appellate jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine. The reasoning from a U.S. Supreme Court opinion applied, which rejected application of the doctrine under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1291 in the context of disqualification orders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence because the facts upon which the search warrant was based were insufficient to form the basis of probable cause. The supreme court disagreed. An officer noted a smell of ether, a substance used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. The officer noticed yellow bottles in a trash bag that looked like bottles usually containing methanol, which could be an ingredient in the manufacture of methamphetamine. The bottles' identification by the officer - who at virtually the identical location, i.e., the barn, hours earlier had noticed the strong smell of ether - was a circumstance to be considered in the probable cause analysis. A concerned citizen's notice of a peculiar smell in burning trash was in some measure corroborated by the strong smell of ether on the premises. The corroboration of part of the citizen's story suggested the reliability of the remainder of the officer's personally sensed information, i.e., the observation of vehicles coming and going and staying for a short time at the residence. Therefore, probable cause existed for the issuance of the search warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of indecent liberties with a child and sentenced as a persistent sex offender to double the maximum duration of the presumptive term of imprisonment for his offense under the provisions of Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a no contest plea as part of a plea agreement. The presentence investigation report (PSI report) revealed that defendant had a juvenile adjudication of aggravated incest in 1987. The PSI report labeled defendant a &quot;persistent sex offender&quot; under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4704(j) (Supp. 2004). The question on appeal was whether the increased sentence that was imposed ran afoul of the Apprendi and Gould protections. The supreme court concluded that it did not. Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum was required to be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, the district court simply used the fact that defendant a prior conviction to impose an extended sentence. In doing so, the sentencing court was not required to make an additional finding of fact beyond that made by the jury. Despite the trial court's classification of defendant as a &quot;persistent sex offender,&quot; a finding still needed to be made beyond a reasonable doubt that the 1987 juvenile adjudication for aggravated incest was sexually motivated under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3717(d)(2)(L) (Supp. 2004).</SPAN></P>

The heart of the driver's attempted appeal involved the preliminary breath test (PBT) administered to him after he was stopped by a police officer. He asserted the PBT was inadmissible and provided no basis for probable cause to warrant the officer's request for a test under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001(a) (2005) or for ultimate suspension of his license. The court held that the Kansas pleading requirements of Kan. Stat.

Compliance with the specific language of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-614(b) was necessary to meet the strict compliance requirement. The driver had not demonstrated that the Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and was sentenced to death. The death sentence was overturned and the matter remanded for resentencing.

The State proposed to show that the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4625(1), because defendant allegedly stalked the victim before killing her. The district court ruled as a matter of law that stalking was not relevant to the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating factor in death penalty proceedings. The court determined initially that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3603, in part, because the ruling would substantially impact on the State's ability to prosecute the case. The court held that the fact that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4625(1) was not amended at the same time as the Hard 50 statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4636(2005) did not preclude consideration of stalking of the victim as a relevant factor to establish that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner.</SPAN></P>

The first jury found defendant guilty of felony murder for commission of a crime based upon an improperly defined theft by exertion of unauthorized control theory. In the first appeal, the appellate court remanded for retrial due to the improper theft by exertion theory. On remand, the jury instruction correctly limited theft to obtaining unauthorized control over property. In the second appeal, the appellate court determined that defendant's conviction of felony murder on remand did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution or Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 10 because the first jury's convictions for felony murder based upon the improperly-defined theory of theft by exerting unauthorized control did not represent acquittals for the remaining theories of felony murder, e.g., theft by obtaining unauthorized control or burglary. The same crime was charged and tried in both trials. Defendants' arguments regarding law of the case, transcribed testimony, and jury instructions also failed.</SPAN></P>

While the charges were pending, defendant was incarcerated for unrelated crimes. The court held that because the evidence was ambiguous, it was reasonable for the district court to believe that the phone monitor listened to the live phone conversation of defendant with his bail bondsman from the jail rather than a recording of the conversation. Also, because the Confrontation Clause did not grant defendant the right to confront himself, his right to confront witnesses against him was not violated by admitting the recording of the phone conversation. Although the district court erred by not redacting references of defendant's other bad acts from the recording, the error was harmless because such evidence was irrelevant. Also, although the prosecutor's comments were insulting, demeaning, and unprofessional, they did not rise to the level of misconduct required by Tosh to require reversal. However, the case was remanded for resentencing because there was no departure sentence to double under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4720(c)(3) (Supp. 2005).</SPAN></P>

The fact that defendant was sentenced to a hard 50 life sentence did not prove that the judge was biased because the trial court's findings concerning the aggravating and mitigating factors was supported by the record. The district court did not err by admitting the victim's 911 call into evidence because: (1) the call corroborated the testimony of the dispatcher, the officer to whom defendant offered his confessions, and the second victim's testimony; (2) the audiotape captured defendant's demeanor at the time of the events; (3) it documented events and the duration of the incident; and (4) it was highly probative as to the essential element of premeditation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State challenged a decision from the Shawnee District Court (Kansas), which entered judgment for plaintiffs by determining that the Kansas School District Finance and Quality Performance Act (SDFQPA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-6405 et seq., was unconstitutional. The mandate was stayed, but plaintiffs filed a motion to show cause after 2006 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 197 (S.B. 549) was passed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court held that the SDFQPA was unconstitutional because it did not make suitable provision for the finance of public schools under Kan. Const. art. 6, &sect; 6. The supreme court upheld this decision in part but stayed the mandate to allow for legislative action. S.B. 549 materially and fundamentally changed the way that education was funded in Kansas. Plaintiffs then filed a motion for a show cause order. In reaffirming the prior orders, the supreme court determined that the case was not moot because the case was in the compliance stage. Next, the constitutionality of 2006 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 197 was not before the supreme court. The school finance system under review was not the same system reviewed in the previous cases. The sole inquiry before the supreme court was whether the legislation complied with its previous orders. This standard was met by S.B. 549. A remand of the case to the district court to allow an amended pleading to challenge the new funding scheme was not warranted. The case had been pending for several years; moreover, because the plan was for three years, it would have taken time to ascertain its full financial impact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The previous order of the supreme court was reaffirmed. Previously ordered stays were lifted. The appeal was dismissed, and the case was remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the pending case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff businesses were awarded compensatory and punitive damages by the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) in a negligence action against defendants, a corporation and its subsidiary. Defendants appealed the denial of their requests for setoff of subrogation claims and the amount of the punitive damages awards of $ 5,250,000 for the two consolidated cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The businesses were destroyed when natural gas migrated from underground storage caverns and ignited. Defendants owned and operated those storage caverns. On appeal, the court held that defendants were entitled to a setoff of damages in the amount equal to that they paid to the businesses' insurers in settlement of their subrogation claims. Because the settlement between the insurers and defendants extinguished the insurers' subrogation rights, thereafter the businesses no longer retained the right to recover damages for the benefit of the insurers. The punitive damages award of $ 5,250,000 did not violate due process because: (1) while the harm to the businesses was economic only, the potential for physical harm to their staff and customers was considerable; (2) defendants deviated from sound operating procedures in pumping gas; (3) the subsidiary's stonewalling after the explosion and fire did not reflect regard for the town's resident's safety; (4) the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages was three to one; and (5) a rough estimate of the sanctions imposed on defendants was half a million dollars. The award did not violate the statutory cap of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-3702(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed insofar as defendants had been denied a setoff in the amount that they had paid the businesses' insurers in settlement of their subrogation claims.

The supreme court agreed. Defendant shot the victim, a paraplegic. However, standing alone, the fact that a victim was killed by gunshots fired by a defendant was generally not sufficient to support a finding that the manner of death was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. There might have been some factual circumstances in which a defendant subjected a defenseless victim to mental anguish because the victim was conscious and aware that death was imminent but completely unable, by virtue of his or her physical condition, to defend him or herself. However, the facts of the case did not warrant such a finding. Any finding that defendant taunted, threatened, or terrorized the victim with the gun or that the victim knew he was going to die prior to being shot required speculation about facts that were not in evidence.</SPAN></P>

He argued, in part, that the trial court erred in (1) excluding evidence of a prior shooting in which the defendant was the victim and (2) not instructing the jury to deliberate premeditation and imperfect self-defense at the same time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's brother was arguing with another man. According to some witnesses, defendant arrived at the scene and started shooting people. The man with whom defendant's brother was arguing was killed. On appeal, the court first found that defendant failed to establish that the trial court improperly excluded relevant, admissible, and noncumulative evidence that was an integral part of his imperfect self-defense theory. With respect to a prior shooting in which defendant was the victim, the trial court properly stated that an expert could testify, pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-456, regarding his own experience with gunshot wounds but could not testify about gunshot violence in inner city African-American communities or the effect of trauma upon a person's future state of mind, without a proper foundation. The court next found no error in the instructions given to the jury with regard to premeditation and imperfect self-defense. In addition, the court held that defendant failed to establish an abuse of discretion in the trial court's consideration of mitigating and aggravating factors, Kan. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Shawnee District Court (Kansas) found defendant guilty of premeditated first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated battery for his involvement in a nightclub shooting. The trial court sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 50 years for the first-degree murder conviction and two 41-month sentences for the aggravated battery convictions.

A detective then asked him if he wanted to speak about the shooting incident at a dance club. Defendant declined because he had no lawyer present.

Substantial competent evidence supported the trial court's findings which permitted the supreme court to independently concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant's Miranda rights were knowingly and voluntarily waived and his statement to a detective was voluntarily and knowingly given. Regarding the duration and manner of the interrogation and his ability on request to communicate with the outside world, the interview itself was short, as defendant invoked his right to counsel after answering the detective's first questions. Also, regarding his age, intellect, and background, defendant was a 26-year-old adult who had previous experience with law enforcement. In addition, defendant had been Mirandized.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Kansas Department of Revenue (KDR) challenged a decision from the Ellsworth District Court (Kansas), which determined that the statutory scheme of the Kansas implied consent law, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;8-1001, was unconstitutional as applied to appellee licensee under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an appeal from an administrative hearing, the licensee contended that he was denied due process of law because he was not allowed to subpoena relevant witnesses to testify at the hearing relating to a license suspension. The district court agreed, and the KDR sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the Kansas implied consent law was not unconstitutional as applied to the facts of the case. Although Wulfkuhle and Carson had required the subpoena of relevant witnesses at an initial administrative hearing in a licensee's license suspension case, the Kansas implied consent law underwent numerous changes after those cases. This included an extensive hearing at the administrative level and an automatic extension of driving privileges if the licensee filed a petition for review in a district court, pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1020. By appealing to the district court, subject to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1014, the licensee had a full due process hearing before any final action was taken against his driving privileges. The licensee was provided with a meaningful hearing and the right to call and cross-examine witnesses before any final action was taken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was reversed, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 20 years. He was also sentenced to 165 months for aggravated kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that the district court erred in allowing into evidence certain information from the confession by coconspirator. The instant court found that the admission of parts of coconspirator's confession violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation and this evidence should have been excluded. The instant court reasoned that the coconspirator did not testify at defendant's trial or other proceedings, denying defendant the opportunity to confront him through cross-examination. However, the instant court found that the error was harmless because, in reviewing the overall strength of the prosecution's case, it had little likelihood of changing the result of the trial. Next, defendant argued that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress his own statements to police. The instant court found that substantial competent evidence supported the trial court's finding that the interpreter was qualified based on his experience and that he was able to properly convey defendant's legal rights to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of raping the victim at a party. On appeal, the court held that the prosecutor committed misconduct by misstating the law during closing arguments by equating the &quot;overcome by force or fear&quot; element of rape with the act of sexual intercourse/penetration, stating that the force of defendant's penis into the victim's vagina satisfied the force element of the rape charge. This error was not harmless, and therefore defendant was entitled to a new trial, because the only guidance the jury was given as to what constituted the necessary force was the prosecutor's misstatement of the law; the jury instructions did not define the &quot;overcome by force or fear&quot; element of rape. The evidence against defendant regarding whether the victim was &quot;overcome by force&quot; was not so direct and overwhelming as to have little weight in the minds of the jurors. It was entirely possible under the facts that the jury could have concluded that defendant's continuance of intercourse after the victim withdrew her consent was sufficient to establish rape without finding that the victim was overcome by force or fear.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1567 (Supp. 2005). The court granted the State's petition for review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Kansas), which affirmed a judgment excluding two of defendant's four prior municipal court DUI convictions for criminal history scoring purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty. The presentence investigation report revealed that defendant had five prior DUI convictions, all committed within a 5-year period. The first three prior DUI convictions occurred in October 1994 in municipal court and were listed as misdemeanors. The fourth prior DUI conviction occurred in February 1996 in municipal court and was also listed as a misdemeanor. The fifth prior DUI conviction, a felony, occurred in September 1998 in district court. The district court struck two of defendant's prior DUI convictions from his criminal history score, convicted him of felony DUI as a fourth-time offender under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1567(g), and sentenced him to 9 months in jail. The sole issue raised by the State on appeal was whether the district court erred in excluding two of defendant's prior convictions on the ground that the municipal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The court found that it did not err. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1567 classified third and subsequent DUI convictions as felonies. Thus, municipalities could not prosecute third or subsequent DUI violations because they were statutorily designated as felonies.</SPAN></P>

The vehicle in which defendant was sitting was described as a &quot;rolling meth lab.&quot; In applying the Blockburger test, the court found that while some of the process, such as gathering paraphernalia, could have occurred at another location, the actions were part of one transaction of manufacturing methamphetamine, and the convictions arose from unitary conduct. Because defendant was convicted under multiple statutes, the same-elements test was the applied in determining whether there was a double jeopardy violation. Because manufacturing methamphetamine required proof of manufacturing, while possession of methamphetamine did not, and possession of methamphetamine required proof of possession, while manufacturing did not, there was not an identity of elements between the two statutes, and no double jeopardy violation. Further, the elements of manufacturing methamphetamine and possession of the ingredients had different elements as well. Therefore, the convictions did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment or Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water permit was issued for irrigation in 1953. Letters were sent to the previous owners, then to the trustees after the previous owners passed away regarding abandonment of the water right due to non-use. The district court found that DWR had not complied with the notice requirements of &sect; 82a-718(b). The court reversed and held that the language &quot;shall be deemed abandoned and shall terminate&quot; clearly meant that by operation of law those water rights shall terminate, regardless of a party's intent, and that the Legislature created an act of forfeiture. The Kansas Water Appropriation Act created a rule that required holders to undertake minimal acts indicative of ownership at least once every 5 years, and it was clear that there was no due and sufficient cause for nonuse from 1971 through 2001. The hearing officer correctly held that because nonuse had already occurred for more than 30 consecutive years, &sect; 82a-718(b)'s notice after 3 years of nonuse advising of one's opportunity to avoid termination through use, or excused nonuse, during a 5-year period simply did not apply.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a sex offender sought to move to the operators' facility, a temporary injunction was granted because the operators had no license. After that problem was corrected, county amended its zoning and subdivision regulations to require a special use permit for certain other types of uses. The district court then granted a permanent injunction, and the operators sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that there was no requirement to show proof of certainty of irreparable harm when applying for injunctive relief. Only a reasonable probability of irreparable future injury was required. This standard was met because the sex offender was likely to reoffend, despite his reduced risk due to poor health, advanced age, and the safeguards of the facility. Next, the facility in question was a &quot;group home&quot; under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;12-736(b)(1), and the sex offender was a person with a disability under &sect; 12-736(b)(3). However, the county was free to impose restrictions or completely exclude group homes for disabled persons with additional characteristics set out in &sect; 12-736(c), and this included disabled transitioning sexually violent predators.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was ordered to pay restitution, court costs, a probation fee, and other fees that included attorney fees and a BIDS administrative fee. On appeal, defendant argued that the sentencing judge violated Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4513 (Supp. 2005). More specifically, the supreme court was called upon to answer two questions: (1) whether such an assessment under the statute was error if a sentencing judge failed to explicitly consider sua sponte at the time of assessment a defendant's ability to pay and the financial burden payment would impose, and (2) whether such an assessment violated a defendant's due process rights if the sentencing judge failed to consider the validity of the fees at the time of assessment. The supreme court determined that the sentencing court, at the time of initial assessment, had to consider defendant's financial resources. Nevertheless, a sentencing court's failure to include such explicit consideration in the record did not render the sentence associated with the resulting assessment &quot;illegal,&quot; as that term was used in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3504. Finally, as to defendant's due process claims, he received both notice and an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that defendant was arrested without probable cause and illegally detained without reasonable suspicion in violation of the Fourth Amendment and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 15. However, that determination did not automatically preclude him from being prosecuted. The court affirmed defendant's convictions because the error in admitting the evidence at issue was harmless. Beyond a reasonable doubt, the erroneous admission of his statements and the key from his pocket could not have affected the trial.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3504(1). Defendant was sentenced to consecutive sentences totaling life plus 68 months in prison and 1 year in jail.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a crowded bar, a dispute broke out between defendant and another man. Defendant fired numerous shots at the other man, hitting several bystanders. Defendant was convicted of first-degree felony murder, attempted voluntary manslaughter, four counts of reckless aggravated battery, a firearms violation, and possession of cocaine. On appeal, the court noted that before consideration of the issue on its merits, the court first had to determine whether a claimed constitutional double jeopardy violation for imposing consecutive sentences fit within the definition of &quot;illegal sentence&quot; as contemplated by &sect; 22-3504(1). The court held that it did not. To meet the definition of an illegal sentence, the claim had to be that the term of the sentence did not conform to relevant statutory provisions. Defendant made no such claim. Rather, defendant's allegation was that his sentence violated a constitutional provision, U.S. Const. amend. V. The court concluded that the district court properly denied relief on the motion to correct an illegal sentence but did so based on the wrong reason. Relief should have been denied because the claim did not fit within the definition of an illegal sentence.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court determined that the Kan. Stat.

After weighing the competing interests, including the type of information requested, the potential harm in disclosure, the adequacy of safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure, and the need for access, the supreme court held that mandamus was warranted as the judge's order did not do all it could to narrow the information gathered to safeguard that information from unauthorized disclosure. While the supreme court agreed with the clinics that the attorney general should not have released some material to the press, the supreme court did not hold him in contempt as no prejudice resulted from his conduct.</SPAN></P>

Its execution outside the jurisdiction designated by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2503 (2004 Supp.) was not a mere technical irregularity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the trial court erred in denying his suppression motion and in limiting testimony about his psychological disorders.

The court held that the trial court did not err in excluding expert testimony about defendant's psychological disorders that could have led him to confess falsely to the murders because allowing the expert to say that his mental condition caused him to lie when confessing was a forbidden invasion of the jury's province of credibility.  The court found that the evidence was insufficient to warrant an instruction on compulsion or the lesser-included offenses of capital and premeditated murder.

Defendant pled no contest to the following drug felonies: possession of ephedrine with intent to manufacture, severity level one; possession of methamphetamine with intent to sell within 1,000 feet of a school, severity level two; possession of methamphetamine, severity level four; and possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to manufacture, severity level four. The sentencing court utilized the presumptive range for a severity level four drug felony, 10-12 months, rather than the range for a severity level one drug felony, 142-161 months. The trial court designated the severity level two felony as the primary crime, which carried a presumptive range of 49-54 months. The primary crime had to be the crime with the highest severity level ranking which was actually sentenced. Thus, the trial court's designation of the primary crime under the facts of this case was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

While inside and in plain view, the officers observed various items that they believed were consistent with a methamphetamine lab. The officers discovered six other individuals inside the house, including defendant, who owned the residence. The court found that the officers were justified in making a warrantless entry into defendant's residence in the hot pursuit of the suspect and in seizing evidence that was in plain view. The officers observed the suspect run into the house and clearly had probable cause to believe that the suspect was inside. The officers were not prohibited from entering the house in hot pursuit of the suspect, even though the suspect did not own or reside in the house, and even though the officers did not have a search warrant for the house.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed found that the sole distinguishing factor weighing against the aggravating circumstance was that the shootings took place within a short period of time, approximately 2 minutes, and that the victim was pronounced dead within approximately 25 minutes of the shooting. Nevertheless, it was clear that the victim was chased and suffered substantial mental anguish as demonstrated by her attempt to escape on one foot and her repeated cries for help before she was killed. Further, the trial judge carefully considered the mitigating factors regarding defendant's posttraumatic stress disorder but made a credibility determination between competing expert opinions regarding the effect of defendant's mental state on his actions. The court did not reject these factors outright, but rather concluded that they were not entitled to much weight based upon the evidence presented at trial. As such, the trial court did not err in imposing a hard 50 sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of criminal sodomy under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3505(a)(2), based on a stipulation that when he was 18 years old he engaged in consensual oral contact with a 14-year-old individual of the same sex. After announcing its Lawrence decision, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the Kansas Court of Appeals, which then rejected defendant's equal protection argument. Defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3522 (Supp. 2004), the unlawful voluntary sexual relations statute, provided for less severe punishment than the sodomy statute in cases, like the one at bar, where a defendant was under 19 and less than 4 years older than a 14-year-old victim. However, the statute, commonly referred to as &quot;the Romeo and Juliet statute,&quot; applied only where the victim and offender were of the opposite sex. Defendant argued that &sect; 21-3522 thus violated the Kansas and U.S. Equal Protection Clauses. The court agreed. The enormous escalation in the severity of punishment meant for defendant that he received a 206-month, rather than a 13-, 14-, or 15-month, prison sentence and that he had to register as a sex offender. Thus, there was a discriminatory classification. Under Lawrence, the court found no rational basis for that classification. Noting the link between the substantive-due-process and equal-protection analyses, the court followed the due process holding that moral disapproval of a group was not a legitimate governmental interest. The court could discern no relationship between the classification and the State's legitimate interests, including its interest in public health.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court struck from the statute the words &quot;and are members of the opposite sex,&quot; reversed defendant's conviction and sentence for criminal sodomy, and remanded the cause with directions that the State be given 30 days in which to charge defendant under the statute without the stricken language or to take other action.</SPAN></P>

The maximum sentence of life imprisonment was imposed. On appeal, the supreme court affirmed, stating that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. It was undisputed that defendant was the only person with the victim when she became unconscious and defendant admitted that he shook the child and threw her toward the bed but that she hit her head on a night stand. Additionally, expert testimony indicated that the victim's injuries were caused by both a shaking and an impact. Even defendant's own expert testified that although he felt there was no evidence that the victim was shaken, he believed that she died as a result of severe child abuse. The district court did not err in denying his motion to suppress his statements to law enforcement officials because the interviews were not custodial interrogations. Additionally, photographs of the victim were relevant and admissible because they were used to either prove the manner of death or to explain medical testimony, or both.</SPAN></P>

While the deceased driver was unable to testify, the defense was able to cross-examine an officer about the fact that he did not ask the driver if the fare had waited inside or outside in the light or shadows, about the number of fares he had driven that evening, how long his shift was, or if he had a second job, whether he had been drinking that evening, or whether he wore glasses. In that manner, the defense was able to attack the credibility of the testimony in some manner.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Harvey district court (Arkansas) that convicted him of first-degree premeditated murder and imposed a &quot;hard 50&quot; life sentence after finding aggravating circumstances existed under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4636(a) and (f) (Supp. 2004) in that defendant was previously convicted of a felony in which he inflicted great bodily harm and the murder was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised numerous claims of error on appeal. The court affirmed his conviction. The court held that the jury view of the crime scene did not result in a violation of Kan. Stat.

The court found that defendant was not entitled to lesser included crime instructions because the overwhelming evidence demonstrated that he was guilty of either intentionally murdering the victim or aiding and abetting the intentional murder. Also, the court held that the trial court did not err in concluding that aggravating circumstances under Kan. Stat.

The trial court issued a 30-day continuance because the trial of a codefendant extended beyond the time previously allotted by the trial court. Although defendant did not object, he claimed that the continuance was the second 30-day continuance pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3402(3)(d), in violation of the statute. However, because the trial court's anticipatory note did not amount to a court order, the trial court did not erroneously grant two 30-day continuances. In addition, the State's efforts to procure the DNA evidence for trial were reasonable. Although the State could inform crime labs of trial deadlines and encourage them to process evidence as quickly as possible, it could not control the crime labs' schedules or case loads. The State was not responsible for the 119 backlogged cases that required DNA testing.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. In the absence of legislation, suppliers of alcohol were not liable to the victims of an intoxicated tortfeasor. The decision to impose liability, and under what circumstances, upon the suppliers of alcohol for the torts of their intoxicated patrons or guests was a matter of public policy which the legislature was best equipped to handle. Even an extremely narrow dram shop law failed to pass, and the 2005 Kansas Legislature had two more opportunities to enact dram shop laws. Both measures failed to pass.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the State's purposes were achieved by the plea agreement. Through the agreement, the State avoided a trial and the attendant risk of a not guilty verdict. The court concluded that the elements of the frustration of purpose doctrine were not met under the facts of the case and that therefore the State could not rescind the plea agreement in this case based upon a mistake of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and the supreme court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The supreme court stated that a jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed aggravated arson in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3719. Thus, aggravated arson could have supported his felony murder and burglary convictions. However, the supreme court also held that it was improper for the prosecutor by questions and comments to draw incriminatory inferences from defendant's constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment to employ counsel as an element of the right to a fair trial. The jurors might have decided that defendant was guilty because the prosecutor implied that defendant must have been guilty by repeatedly eliciting testimony and commenting on defendant's contacting counsel. Under such circumstances, the error was not harmless. Further, it was error for the trial court to close the courtroom for announcement of the verdicts. Thus, defendant was denied his right to have a public trial. The court concluded that the evidence sufficiently established defendant's criminal responsibility for the explosion and fire.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee citizens sued appellants, the State of Kansas, the board members, and the commissioner, in Shawnee County District Court (Kansas), to challenge the public school finance system. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Kansas ruled that the Kansas Legislature failed to make suitable provision for finance of the public school system. The Legislature subsequently presented its remedy for determination of whether it complied with the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior order in the case, the state supreme court determined that the Kansas Legislature had failed to make suitable provision for finance of the public school system because the financing formula used to finance the public school system in the State of Kansas did not comply with Kan. Const. art. 6, &sect; 6. The Legislature then passed H.B. 2247 (Kan. 2005) in response to the court's order for remedial action, while the court retained jurisdiction. The court was then required to review the remedial school finance legislation to see if it complied with the court's order by remedying the infirmities in the Kansas School District Finance and Quality Performance Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-6405 et seq., identified in the court's prior opinion, and made suitable provision for financing of education by bringing the State's school financing formula into compliance with Kan. Const. art. 6, &sect; 6. The court concluded that a continuing lack of constitutionally adequate funding together with the inequity-producing local property tax measures meant that the school financing formula, as altered by H.B. 2247, still fell short of the standard set by Kan. Const. art. 6, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kansas Legislative Division of Post Audit was commissioned to conduct a comprehensive and extensive cost study to be presented to the Kansas Legislature, the court issued financing directives for additional funding, and the court retained jurisdiction of the appeal. If necessary, further action was to be taken by the court as was deemed advisable to ensure compliance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-5a01 between the tax treatment for interstate and intercounty gas gathering systems on the one hand and intracounty gas gathering systems on the other.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company's gas gathering system crossed the Kansas state line into Oklahoma and Colorado. The Kansas Department of Revenue valued the company's interstate and intercounty gas gathering systems at 33 percent of its fair market value pursuant to &sect; 79-5a01 and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-1439(b)(2)(C). In contrast, it valued the company's intracounty gathering system at a lower rate because it was &quot;commercial and industrial&quot; property and not a &quot;public utility&quot; under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-5a01. The BOTA majority ruled that the cumulative appraised value of the company's property was $11 million higher than it would have been if the company was an intracounty gas gathering system. On appeal, the court extended the U.S. Supreme Court's rationale from the Dean Milk case and determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-5a01 was facially discriminatory and had the effect of unduly burdening interstate commerce. The court found also that the additional $900,000 in taxes that the company had to pay could not be characterized as a de minimis or even minor impact. Accordingly, the court found that &sect; 79-5a01's statutory differentiation was unconstitutional under the federal Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision and remanded the cause, ruling that Kansas's statutory differentiation between the tax treatment for interstate and intercounty gas gathering systems on the one hand and intracounty gas gathering systems on the other violated the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court determined that &sect; 8-1020(g) limited the witnesses at the hearing to any officer who signed the certification form and to one other witness that was present at the issuance of the certification. Only one officer was involved in the driver's detention, testing, and arrest. The driver did not proffer the substance of testimony that she expected from other witnesses that she wanted to call. In light of the officer's uncontradicted testimony, the driver's own admissions concerning the consumption of alcohol, and her mere speculation about the testimony of other witnesses, she did not establish that any other relevant witnesses existed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Butler County (Kansas) that convicted him of first-degree premeditated murder and imposed a hard 25 life sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder after he drove two hours to a store where his son-in-law worked, walked in, and shot him three times. Defendant filed notice of his intent to rely on the defense of lack of mental state or mental capacity as provided Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3220 based on his expert's psychological evaluation that showed defendant was suffering from depression. Defendant's guardianship of his grandson had just been terminated, and defendant suspected his son-in-law was sexually abusing the child. The trial court granted the State's motion to exclude the expert's testimony. On appeal, the court held that the trial court violated defendant's due process right to present his defense by refusing to allow his expert to testify, by failing to instruct the jury on the defense of mental disease or defect, and by instructing the jury that mental disease or defect was not a defense. The court held that &sect; 22-3220 removed insanity and diminished capacity as separate defenses and instead focused on a lack of the mental state required as an element of an offense; therefore, the expert should have been allowed to testify about defendant's lack of intent to commit the murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant testified at his trial and denied shooting either victim. Defendant argued that exhibits 94 and 95 should have been excluded from evidence. The State argued that the photographs were generally relevant for the purpose of establishing the extent and nature of the first victim's wounds, and emphasized that the pathologist referred to the two pictures while explaining the cause of death, which was helpful to the jury's understanding of his medical testimony. The State also claimed the pictures were probative on the manner of death and the violent nature of the crimes. The appellate court ruled that the State's exhibits 94 and 95 showed the extent, nature, and number of wounds inflicted, and assisted the jury's understanding of medical testimony. The exhibits helped the pathologist explain the cause of death and proved the manner of death and the violent nature of the crime. The photographs were unpleasant but not gruesome. The photographs were not repetitious or cumulative, but rather the only two photographs showing the victim from particular angles. Also, the Kansas hard 50 sentencing statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4638 (Supp. 2004), was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Before the investigator asked defendant a single question about the crime, defendant was blaming the victim's daughter and questioning her motive. Indeed, every time defendant mentioned an attorney, he spontaneously reinitiated conversation with the officers about the crimes. Specifically, after the investigator was finally able to deliver the Miranda warnings, defendant disclosed how he and the daughter set the fire. That disclosure was not prompted by questioning. The investigator then asked defendant if he wanted to continue talking about the case. Defendant responded that he had signed the Miranda form and would speak with the investigator but might not answer all of his questions. He also advised the investigator that he had been arrested before and therefore understood his Miranda rights and his ability to waive them. Under the totality of the circumstances, the facts found by the trial court were supported by substantial competent evidence, and defendant's motion to suppress his statement was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Wyandotte District Court (Kansas) found defendant guilty of premeditated first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, and aggravated kidnapping.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not establish error in the trial court's decision to deny his motion to endorse the psychiatrist's testimony because (1) the motion to endorse, if considered a notice of the defense of mental disease or defect under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3219, was untimely; (2) defendant did not establish good cause for the delayed notice as there was some question as to his mental status well before his July 2003 trial setting and there was more than sufficient time for any necessary mental examinations; (3) the trial court did not err in failing to consider the factors used to determine whether to exclude the testimony of a defense witness because no notice of a defense under &sect; 22-3219 had been given; and (4) the notice requirements of &sect; 22-3219 did not deprive defendant of his constitutional due process right to defend against the State's case or the constitutional right to a fair trial. Also, there was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that defendant committed the murder in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner. Thus, the trial court's use of that aggravating factor in determining defendant's sentence was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-1301 et seq., over the continuing objection of the minority participant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operating company wished to inject water into a formation channel to increase oil production. The minority participant objected to the unitization application. The evidence showed that the natural state of the formations had been altered by commingling formations in some of the well bores. The parties' wells were in pressure communication, which meant that a change in pressure in one area would affect other areas. The court held that the proposed unitization met the statutory requirements for unit operation of a pool. As defined in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-1302, a pool was characterized by a single pressure system so that production from one part of the pool affected the reservoir pressure throughout its extent. An amendment to &sect; 55-1302 did not alter this definition. The agency's finding that the unit operating agreement was fair and equitable under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-1304 (2003 Supp.) was supported by substantial competent evidence, pursuant to the standards set forth in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-621(c)(7), (8). The use of prior data in evaluating production was not arbitrary or capricious. Exclusion of the minority participant's acreage would violate correlative rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Kansas Court of Appeals, which held that he had consented to a preliminary breath test (PBT), and which affirmed a trial court's judgment convicting him of driving or attempting to drive a vehicle while having a blood alcohol level greater than .08 in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1567(a)(2). The trial court had denied defendant's motion to suppress the alleged involuntary PBT and the resultant blood test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue on appeal was whether defendant gave voluntary, knowing, and intelligent consent to the search of his deep lung air through the use of a PBT. The court held that taking defendant's deep lung air was a search requiring, under the circumstances, his consent. The particular PBT used on defendant tested his deep lung breath for chemical analysis and, thus, was a search subject to the strictures of the Fourth Amendment. The State did not meet its burdens of establishing that defendant's consent to the search was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently given or that his consent was impliedly given. Defendant's mere acquiescence to the PBT did not establish voluntary consent. If an officer established only the minimum of one of the predicates for testing listed in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1012, he could not request that a driver be tested via the implied consent provisions contained in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001(a) because application of the implied consent provisions required meeting two predicates in &sect; 8-1001(b). The results of the PBT were not admissible, and the subsequent blood test results were also inadmissible. Without that evidence, defendant's conviction could not stand.</SPAN></P>

The Johnson District Court, Kansas, ruled that the Act was constitutional, issued a 1-year protection from stalking order (PSO), and awarded the wife $ 5,000 in attorney fees. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband challenged the constitutionality of Kan. Stat.

While the PSO that had been entered against the husband had expired by the time the case was heard on appeal, the state supreme court agreed to address the issue as the constitutionality of the Act was a matter of public importance capable of repetition. The state supreme court affirmed the trial court's determination that &sect; 63-31a02 was constitutional. The state supreme court held that the statute was not vague, as two objective standards were used to modify the terms &quot;alarms,&quot; &quot;annoys,&quot; &quot;torments,&quot; or &quot;terrorizes,&quot; and the statute clearly conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. Also, the term &quot;legitimate purpose&quot; was subject to an objective standard and excluded constitutionally protected conduct. The statute was not overbroad, as the inclusion of objective standards and the express statement to exclude constitutionally protected speech indicated it was sufficiently tailored so as not infringe on First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Kansas Court of Appeals, which affirmed a district court's decision regarding sentencing for possession of ephedrine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was sentenced for violating Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-7006, he filed an appeal. He argued that he should have been sentenced under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4152 instead. Defendant relied on the Frazier decision to support his argument. However, the court of appeals found that Frazier was wrongly decided, and affirmed the sentence. In reversing, the court determined that the court of appeals' decision regarding Frazier was incorrect. The rule was that where two criminal offenses had identical elements, but were classified differently for purposes of imposing a penalty, a defendant convicted of either crime could have only been sentenced under the lesser penalty provision. The court noted that there were three situations where defendant's conduct was covered by two statutes. The court sought to curb the situation where unfettered prosecutorial discretion was permitted. The statutes in question were overlapping rather than duplicative. Because the elements under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 65-4152, 65-7006 were the same whether defendant was charged under either statute, he should have been sentenced under the lesser penalty provisions of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4152(a)(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case challenging the public education funding scheme, the Shawnee District Court, Kansas, held that the Kansas School District Finance and Quality Performance Act (SDFQPA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-6405 et seq., was unconstitutional. Defendants, the State and individuals with the board of education, appealed. Plaintiffs, school districts and students, cross appealed a finding that the legislature did not abrogate the board's obligations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the finding that SDFQPA did not violate the Kansas or U.S. Equal Protection Clauses because the funding differentials as provided were rationally related to a legitimate legislative purpose. SDFQPA was also not unconstitutional based solely on its &quot;disparate impact.&quot; The court found, however, that substantial evidence supported a holding that the legislature failed to meet its burden under Kan. Const. art. 6, &sect; 6 to &quot;make suitable provision for finance&quot; of the public schools. Based on the record and the legislature's own definition of &quot;suitable education,&quot; Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46-1225(e) (Supp. 2003), the standard was not being met under the current financing formula. Specifically, SDFQPA failed to provide adequate funding for a suitable education for students of middle- and large-sized districts with a high proportion of minority and/or at-risk and special education students. Some school districts were forced to use local option budgets to finance general education, rather than &quot;extra&quot; expenses as intended. Failure to do any cost analysis distorted the low enrollment, special education, vocational, bilingual education, and the at-risk student weighting factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a brief decision, the court reversed the finding of equal protection violations, affirmed as to failure to make suitable provision for public finance, and affirmed on the cross appeal. The court retained jurisdiction to allow the legislature to correct the infirmity, with the present formula in effect until further order. The court withheld formal opinion pending corrective legislation or until April 12, 2005 and stayed issuance of mandate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit brought by appellee school districts, appellants, the State and the state board of education, appealed from a decision of the Shawnee District Court (Kansas) holding that the Kansas School District Finance and Quality Performance Act (SDFQPA), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-6405 et seq., was unconstitutional. The district court made findings regarding the various statutory and societal changes which occurred after the decision in U.S.D. No. 229.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was the constitutionality of the statutory scheme for funding the public schools. Inter alia, the Supreme Court of Kansas held that the SDFQPA financing formula did not have an unconstitutional disparate impact on minorities and/or other classes. However, the legislature failed to meet its burden as imposed by Kan. Const. art.  6, &sect; 6 to &quot;make suitable provision for finance&quot; of the public schools. The court needed to look no further than the legislature's own definition of suitable education, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46-1225(e) (2003), to determine that the standard was not being met under the current financing formula. In particular, the school districts (Salina and Dodge City) established that the SDFQPA failed to provide adequate funding for a suitable education for students of their and other similarly situated districts, i.e., middle- and large-sized districts with a high proportion of minority and/or at-risk and special education students. Also, while the original intent of the provision for local option budgets within the financing formula was to fund &quot;extra&quot; expenses, some school districts had been forced to use local option budgets to finance general education.</SPAN></P>

The district court's holding that the legislature had failed to meet its burden to make suitable provision for finance of the public schools was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) convicted defendant of first-degree premeditated murder and aggravated assault arising out of the shooting death of his former girlfriend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's argument of prosecutorial misconduct, based on the concept of temporal concurrence, or the idea that the intent must exist at the same time as the act, was technically correct. However, his interpretation of the prosecutor's statement was too broad. The prosecutor's statements were fair comment on the evidence. That defendant was convicted of premeditated first-degree murder showed that any error in the prosecutor's statement was harmless. Defendant's challenge to the hard 50 sentencing scheme was based on the holding of Apprendi, that facts increasing the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum had to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Exposing a defendant to a later parole eligibility was not the equivalent of exposing him to an increased maximum penalty. Defendant contended that, because the State failed to show the victim was in reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm, his conviction for aggravated assault had to be reversed. A rational factfinder could easily find that defendant placed him in reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence, arguing that the sentence from the first sodomy case should also have been converted. The motion was denied. The court affirmed, stating that defendant was not on parole in the first sodomy case when he committed the acts in second sodomy case. However, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for DNA testing. Although the court held that &sect; 21-2512 was unconstitutional because it failed to include defendant's specific situation, the court concluded that &sect; 21-2512 should not be nullified but rather extended to allow a defendant convicted of aggravated criminal sodomy for penetrating a female's anus with his penis to petition for DNA testing.

He was sentenced to death for the capital offense, life imprisonment with a mandatory minimum term of 40 years for the other murder, 51 months for aggravated arson, and 34 months for aggravated burglary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions and that Kan. Stat.

The court found that the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant set fire to the victims' house, that one of the victim's burns was the proximate cause of her death, and that defendant acted intentionally and with premeditation in killing the other victim. However, the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to engage in an evaluation of the totality of facts and circumstances under Kan. Stat.

The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that aggravating circumstances in support of imposition of a hard 40 sentence were not outweighed by mitigating circumstances. The court concluded that Kan. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) that convicted him of first-degree murder of his girlfriend by strangulation and sentenced him to a hard 50 life sentence. Defendant claimed the trial court erred in not giving instructions on lesser included offenses; in admitting evidence of prior bad acts; in denying his motion to suppress; in denying Batson challenges; and in imposing a hard 50 sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence. The court held that defendant failed to preserve the issue of a lesser included offense instruction on voluntary manslaughter and that there was no evidence to support the element of severe provocation or of recklessness for reckless second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. The victim was found with a cord around her neck and injuries indicating that she was intentionally choked for 4-6 minutes, which caused brain death. The court rejected defendant's claim that he was incapable of forming the requisite intent due to his intoxication, and held that defendant placed his intent at issue, therefore evidence of attacks on a prior girlfriend were properly admitted to show his intent and premeditation in the murder. The court held that the motion to suppress was properly denied because the police officer's entry into his home was justified by the emergency doctrine exception to the warrant requirement. The officers knew the victim lived there, and a neighbor told them he heard an argument and a woman's scream. The court rejected defendant's claims of error as to the findings as to aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Kansas Court of Appeals, which affirmed a district court's decision to convict him of six drugs offenses. Specifically, defendant challenged the sentences imposed for possession of ephedrine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to use it to manufacture a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with various offenses after drugs and other items were found inside a residence. After defendant was convicted, he was sentenced under the unlawful possession of ephedrine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-7006(d) (Supp. 2000). Defendant contended that he should have been sentenced under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4152 (Supp. 2000), the statute for possession of drug paraphernalia. After the sentence was affirmed, defendant again sought review. In affirming, the court determined that a sentence under the statute carrying the lesser penalty was required if the two offenses were identical. The court found that the statutes at issue were overlapping rather than duplicative. As such, the court had to determine if they gave the prosecutor unfettered sentencing discretion. The drug paraphernalia charge included such items as jars, dishes, microwave, lithium batteries, filters, funnels, plastic lids, and baggies. The charge did not include &quot;products or materials&quot; within the meaning of Kan. Stat. Ann. 65-4150(c); therefore, it was not identical to the charge of possession of ephedrine with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Kansas), which affirmed the trial court judgment that denied her motion to suppress and convicted and sentenced her for possession of cocaine and possession of marijuana. The trial court and court of appeals held that, under the totality of the circumstances, the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant and that a warrantless search could be upheld as a search incident to arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the search that revealed the cocaine was unconstitutional. The evidence showed that defendant was arrested in a bar known for drug activity after a law enforcement officer, who had known her for 8 years and knew she used drugs in the past, observed that she was holding a piece of a torn plastic baggie in her hand, was under the influence, and was uncharacteristically avoiding eye contact with the officer and acting nervous. The officer grabbed her wrist and opened her hand, which revealed the cocaine. The State did not contest the trial court's finding that the officer arrested defendant when he grabbed her wrist. The court held that a combination of several factors created probable cause, because the facts and circumstances within the law enforcement officer's knowledge were sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that the offense of possession was being committed. The court held that, because there was probable cause to arrest defendant, her arrest did not contravene the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments or Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 15 and the search, as a search incident to arrest was lawful.</SPAN></P>

The district court found that the regulations were reasonably related to inmate rehabilitation, but the appellate court held the regulations unconstitutional. The court affirmed the district court's determination, stating that substantial evidence supported the district court's finding that the regulations were rationally related to the rehabilitation of prisoners. IMPP 11-101 was designed to create incentives for inmates to behave and there was substantial competent evidence supporting the district court's finding that IMPP 11-101 was not an exaggerated response to the concept of rehabilitation for the inmates. The court additionally rejected the appellate court's suggestion of an alternate special purchase order, because it placed the burden of additional verification on the prison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's neighbor reported to authorities that defendant brought up the neighbor's ex-wife and children, saying in part that he knew where the ex-wife lived, where she worked, the places she frequented, and with whom she associated. When the neighbor asked how defendant knew those things, defendant responded that he was a &quot;triple agent&quot; with the KBI. He was subsequently convicted of misdemeanor false impersonation of a KBI agent and the supreme court affirmed on appeal. Acceptance of defendant's overbreadth argument required the supreme court to reweigh defendant's and the neighbor's credibility, which was not its function. The district judge who heard and observed both men's testimony found the neighbor's version of the conversation more believable and the supreme court could not reject the neighbor's version of the conversation and adopt defendant's on appeal. Further, defendant's statement was not mere puffing and did not test the outer limits of constitutionally protected speech. Because defendant's sufficiency claim relied upon elements of the crime that the supreme court refused to read into the legislature's choice of statutory language, his claim failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the trial court's grant of defendants' suppression motion and the dismissal of the drug charges against defendants. The court held that the trial court's decision to dismiss and its decision to grant defendants' suppression motions were one and the same; thus, the State's citation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3602(b)(1) (Supp. 2003), which authorized an appeal from the dismissals, was sufficient to preserve the State's right to challenge the basis of the dismissal decisions. The warrantless entry by police officers into an apartment where defendants were social guests was not excusable when a warrantless search of the residence would be unconstitutional. There were not exigent circumstances that allowed the entry of the police into the apartment, because loud music and the smell of marijuana did not indicate that any suspect was likely to be charged with a violent offense. Application of the inevitable discovery doctrine was inappropriate, because it was not inevitable that defendants would have remained at the apartment, even if the officers had stood guard outside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that her guilty plea was of no significance because the imposition of a drug severity level 1 felony sentence was an illegal sentence. The supreme court found that the trial court had jurisdiction to find defendant guilty and impose sentence. Further, defendant's sentence conformed to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-4159 as to both its character and term of punishment. Defendant's sentence was not ambiguous in the time or manner in which it was to be served. Thus, defendant's sentence was not &quot;illegal.&quot; However, the supreme court also found that Sub. H.B. 2777 (codified at 23-21 Kan. Reg. 720 (2004)) increased the penalty to which defendant would have been subject if the legislation was applied to her. Without the legislation, she would have been sentenced for a drug severity level 3 felony; if the legislation was effective as to her, she would have been sentenced for a drug severity level 1 felony. Therefore, the retroactivity provision of the house bill could not have been constitutionally applied to defendant so as to avoid an ex post facto violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Shawnee District Court (Kansas) affirmed a final order of appellee Kansas Department of Human Resources imposing a civil fine against appellant workers' compensation claimant for fraudulent or abusive acts under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-5,120 (1993). The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was an illegal immigrant who obtained employment using an assumed name and social security number. The claimant was injured during the course of her employment and filed a workers' compensation action using the assumed name. The district court determined that the use of an assumed name constituted a fraudulent or abusive act under &sect; 44-5,120(d)(4)(A) or (B). On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the claimant's use of an assumed name in applying for benefits and lying under oath were abusive, notwithstanding the claimant's legal entitlement to the benefits. The court found that the concealment of the employee's true identity amounted to the concealment of a material fact under &sect; 44-5,120(d)(4)(B). The court stated that, without knowledge of the claimant's true identity, her employer would not be able to obtain and verify her previous medical or work history. The court also rejected the claimant's argument that the order was based upon alienage and therefore unconstitutional. The court stated that the claimant was not being penalized based on her alien status, but for her actions in intentionally and willfully using a false identity throughout the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Johnson district court (Kansas) found her not guilty by lack of mental state, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3428 (Supp. 2003), and committed her to a state hospital for a 90-day evaluation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 22-3428(1)(a) granted her a right to an immediate hearing after her acquittal by reason of mental disease or defect as to whether she was a harm to herself or others. The court disagreed, finding that the trial court's order was consistent with the express provisions of the statute. Language in the second sentence regarding prima facie evidence, when considered with the entire statute, justified language in the first sentence mandating commitment. That subsection contained no express provision for a hearing, but &sect; 22-3428(1)(b), (c), and (d) set forth a comprehensive procedure, including a full hearing within 120 days. The automatic commitment also did not violate due process principles. The limited commitment was simply to conduct an evaluation in order to provide defendant with a precommitment due process hearing. The procedure struck a reasonable balance between the citizens' right to be protected from a defendant acquitted by reason of mental disease and a defendant's right to be free when she was no longer a danger. The procedures and system set forth in the statute were constitutional and did not result in cruel and unusual punishment as applied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that he was not present, although the evidence showed that he had purchased the shotgun and that his car was used during the crime. The trial court gave an aiding and abetting instruction. The court found no error because the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find defendant guilty as a principal or as an aider and abettor. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3205 did not require that an aider and abettor be physically present during the crime. Likewise, there was no presence requirement in the felony-murder statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3401(b). Because burglary was an inherently dangerous felony under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3436, the prosecution did not need to show that the murder was reasonably foreseeable. A prosecutorial violation of a motion in limine was harmless error because the evidence of guilt was overwhelming. Defense counsel was not ineffective with respect to preparation for trial, examining witnesses, objecting to evidence, or an alleged conflict of interest. Because the co-defendants pled guilty to lesser offenses, the trial court was not required to discuss the sentencing disparity on the record.</SPAN></P>

The police investigation led to the arrest of several suspects, including defendant, who was then 16 years old. He was properly tried as an adult pursuant to Kan. Stat.

The 3-month delay between defendant's arrest and preliminary hearing did not violate his right to a speedy trial; because he failed to file a motion to dismiss, he waived the issue. Defendant was not entitled to suppress his statement to police, because he waived his Miranda rights. A doctor was permitted to testify regarding the proximate cause of the victim's death. The jury was properly instructed as to the proximate cause defense. A codefendants' redacted statements were admissible at trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court concluded that, because provisions of the Kansas Liquor Control Act, Kan. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 41-208 prohibiting the cities from passing ordinances in conflict with the Liquor Control Act did not prevent the Cities from exercising home rule with regard to liquor control. As between the will of the people expressed in Kan. Const. art. 12, &sect; 5 and that expressed in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-208, the former prevailed. The court stated that, since the adoption of Kan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated kidnapping and attempted rape. On appeal, the Kansas Court of Appeals remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of his allegations regarding his claim of inadequacy of representation; the trial judge rejected defendant's claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant raised several issues in arguing that his counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The supreme court agreed, concluding that defendant was substantially prejudiced by defense counsel's inadequacy of representation in failing to seek a pretrial competency evaluation and failing to understand and apply the correct law regarding the defense of mental disease or defect. It was clear that defendant's counsel should have sought another competency hearing prior to trial, considering that defendant had an extensive history of mental illness and frequent commitments and a doctor testified that it was unlikely that defendant could have remained competent throughout the stress of a trial. Further, defendant's counsel did not adequately prepare for trial, because, by his own admission, he was unaware of the proper legal standard for a defense of mental disease or defect. In this regard, his performance was deficient. Applying the Barker factors, the supreme court held that the 15-month delay between the time of defendant's arrest and the date of trial did not violate his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City sought review of a decision of the Kansas Board of Tax Appeals (BOTA), which affirmed the state revenue department's assessment of sales tax, compensating use tax, and interest for transactions by the water utility department. The City also appealed BOTA's denial of attorney fees and the issuance of a protective order regarding internal revenue department documents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City argued that BOTA's conclusions were erroneous because the assessed transactions did not constitute &quot;sales&quot; as defined by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3602(c) (Supp. 1992). The court disagreed and held that the interdepartmental transfers clearly constituted an exchange of property for consideration to the taxable water department. This conclusion prevented Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-72(a) from being construed to violate Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3606(b)(2) (Supp. 1992) and being declared void. Because water department fees had to be paid, whether by the developer or the final customer, in order to establish or maintain water from the City, they were part of the total cost to the consumer under Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-46. As such, they were included within the selling price under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3602(g) (Supp. 1992) and were a part of gross receipts under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3603(a) (Supp. 1992), upon which sales tax was collected. Computer equipment used by the water department did not qualify for an exemption under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3606(b) (Supp. 1992). BOTA's determination that it was without jurisdiction to award attorney fees under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3268 was correct.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was allowed to exploit all inconsistencies in her original statement compared to her trial testimony and was allowed to ask about several convictions she had for crimes of dishonesty. Although defendant was denied cross-examination on the pending charge, the witness appeared on the stand in an orange jump suit, which was traditional prison garb. The trial court reasoned that it would have left an unfair impression with the jury that the witness was testifying falsely because she had made a deal with the State, with no evidence to support such an inference, and with the stipulation of defendant that no deal had even been discussed with the witness. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to attempted robbery, felony possession of marijuana following a prior conviction, misdemeanor theft, and two counts of misdemeanor child endangerment. The trial court imposed consecutive 12-month jail sentences on each of the three misdemeanor offenses, to run consecutive to the primary offense of attempted robbery. Defendant appealed her sentence, arguing that the trial court did not have authority to impose consecutive jail sentences on her misdemeanor offenses. The lower appellate court ruled that the trial court had statutory authority to impose consecutive imprisonment sentences on the misdemeanor offenses under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4608(a). On further appeal, defendant argued that the lower appellate court failed to address the distinction between the use of the terms &quot;confinement&quot; and &quot;imprisonment&quot; in the statutes authorizing the punishment for misdemeanor and felony offenses. The court rejected defendant's argument, stating that imprisonment and confinement were one and the same and could be used interchangeably. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 21-4608(a) empowered the trial court to impose consecutive sentences in misdemeanor convictions.</SPAN></P>

Although defendant testified that he did not intend to hit anyone, one of the passengers died after receiving three gunshot wounds. At trial, the trial court did not provide the jury with a definition of reckless. The court held that the instructions for the two offenses, taken together, acceptably conveyed the meanings and degrees of recklessness to the jury. The phrase &quot;extreme indifference to the value of human life&quot; was not so vague as to be unconstitutionally void. The court rejected defendant's argument that he had a right to an all-or-nothing defense. The 1998 amendment to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3107 did not relieve trial courts of the obligation to instruct on lesser offenses. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the murder conviction, because defendant fired into darkness in the direction of a vehicle that he knew was occupied. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the pre-death photograph of the victim, which served to identify the victim and show the extent of his wounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court erred by failing to suppress a videotape of his pre-Miranda and post-Miranda statements. The court affirmed the district court's judgment, stating that, absent coercion or improper tactics by the officers in obtaining the initial statements, there was no presumption of compulsion as to the subsequent post-Miranda statements. In applying the factors to be considered in determining whether the confession was voluntary, the court found that there was nothing to suggest that defendant's post-Miranda statements were involuntary. Additionally, the court held that the district court's error in failing to sustain an objection to the prosecutor's closing remark that premeditation did not take any amount of time was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as there was no evidence that the prosecutor's remark was a deliberate misstatement of the law and there was overwhelming evidence of premeditation. The court also held that the admission of a photograph of the deputy in his uniform was relevant to prove identity and to prove that he was a law enforcement officer, both of which were elements that the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Johnson District Court (Kansas) dismissed four criminal cases on the ground that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3764(d) (Supp. 2002), which defines unlawful removal of a theft detection device, was unconstitutionally vague. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The four defendants were charged because they were observed removing electronic sensor tags from various retail items in various retail stores. They persuaded two district court judges that &quot;theft detection device&quot; and &quot;prior to purchase&quot; and &quot;removal&quot; did not convey a definite meaning to persons of common intelligence. The district court held the statute therefore failed the vagueness test. Persons of common intelligence would have no trouble understanding the meaning of the ordinary words making up the phrase &quot;theft detection device&quot; to mean any item used for the purpose of theft detection at the time of the act alleged to be a violation. The ordinary words that make up the phrase &quot;prior to purchase&quot; were even less conducive to confusion. Finally, with regard to &quot;removal,&quot; the ordinary meaning of &quot;removal&quot; was commonly understood to be movement that put space between two things or relocated one thing from one place to another. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3764(d) (Supp. 2002), properly construed, included a requirement that the accused possess a specific intent to facilitate a theft, which provided adequate safeguards against arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error, observing that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-2438 (1996 Supp.) required the Board to apply a de novo standard in reviewing a valuation by the Kansas Department of Revenue Property Valuation Division (PVD) and that the Board had done so. A taxpayer had the burden under Kan. Stat.

Original cost was an acceptable method of allocation under &sect; 79-5a04 as an alternative to the unit valuation process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the company contended its unit value was overvalued, because BOTA based its valuation upon a forecast of the company's future income; intangible assets not subject to tax in Kansas were included in the unit values, and BOTA's adoption of overall capitalization rates were not supported by the weight of evidence. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the evidence supported BOTA's determination of the company's income for the years in question, notwithstanding the Department of Revenue Property Valuation Division's (PVD) use of historical evidence of the company's income. BOTA was acting within its area of expertise, and its decision to adopt the PVD's income figures for the years in question was entitled to great weight and deference. Further, BOTA's decision with respect to the capitalization rates were in line with the interstate natural gas pipeline industry. BOTA's inclusion of intangibles in its valuation did not raise a Kansas constitutional issue, and BOTA's decision to include such intangibles was factually and legally supported in the record.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The State had a special need for accurately solving future crimes and, thereby, protecting the safety and welfare of Kansas citizens. That special need was beyond the normal need for law enforcement, because it did not in and of itself detect criminal wrongdoing. A convicted person had a lessened expectation of privacy. The State authorities were not allowed to choose which offenders would provide samples, but were directed by the statute to collect and catalog samples from all persons convicted of the listed crimes. There was nothing random or arbitrary about the State's action in collecting the DNA samples. Thus, a warrant was unnecessary to protect citizens from random or arbitrary DNA collection under the statute. In addition, there was the potential for finding DNA evidence at burglary crime scenes, because the entry could have been achieved through breaking windows.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner denied the request because the acquiring company intended to reduce the reserves of the acquired company. The proposed reserves would have met the minimum requirements of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-2c01. The trial court, without conducting a substantial evidence review, concluded pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-621(c)(4) that the Commissioner had incorrectly interpreted and applied the acquisition statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-3304. The court, in reversing the trial court, observed that simply meeting statutory minimum surplus requirements or premium rate requirements for an existing domestic company did not automatically equate to operating in the interest of the public, policyholders, or the insurance-buying public in the context of acquisition by a foreign company. It was reasonable for the Commissioner to be concerned about the impact on policyholders of an abrupt reduction in a company's long-time surplus. Moreover, the statutory standards provided sufficient guidance to comply with Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1 and did not result in an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to an administrative agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. The supreme court disagreed. The victim testified at trial to two separate touchings occurring on two separate nights. The victim indicated at trial that defendant touched his penis by closing his fist and moving it back and forth and indicated that defendant touched his buttocks by waving his hand back and forth. The testimony of the victim at trial was sufficiently similar to his testimony at the preliminary examination and his statements during the taped interview. Thus, the victim's testimony was sufficient to satisfy the first element of both counts of aggravated indecent liberties. The victim testified, and it was not controverted, that he was eight years old at the time of the alleged touchings, thus satisfying the second element of both counts. There was evidence that the alleged touchings occurred between January 1, 1999, and July 31, 1999. Thus, there was also evidence that satisfied the third element of both counts. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Democratic Party and its nominee brought an action in mandamus and quo warranto seeking an interpretation of and challenging the constitutionality of Kan.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 19-504, 25-3902, and 25-3903 (2002 Supp.), the scheme that provided for filling vacancies in offices, in particular, a vacancy created by the resignation of a county treasurer. Respondents were the Republican Party, its nominee, and the governor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county treasurer was elected as a Democrat, but switched to the Republican Party before she resigned. Each party selected a candidate that it certified to the governor. The Democrats sued for an interpretation of the governing statutes and to have their candidate appointed. The court agreed that mandamus and quo warranto were appropriate means for resolving the matter. Because statutory interpretation decided the case, the court did not reach the constitutional challenge. The issue was, when an officeholder changed political affiliation during her term of office and then resigned, did &quot;of the party&quot; in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25-3902 mean the party to which the officeholder belonged when elected or when the vacancy occurred. The Republicans' First Amendment freedom of association argument was unavailing. An individual's freedom to switch party affiliation was not in question, nor was it relevant to the correct interpretation of the statute in question. In the court's view, public policy comported with common sense to dictate that &quot;of the party&quot; meant the political party to which the officeholder belonged at the time of the preceding election for that office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ of mandamus and directed the governor to appoint the candidate chosen by the county Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the severity level of the crime, combined with defendant's criminal history score of I, called for a presumptive sentence of 38-41-43 months in prison; the trial court followed the plea agreement and sentenced defendant to 48 months in prison. As defendant received an upward durational departure sentence pursuant to &sect; 21-4716, a statutory sentencing scheme the supreme court had repeatedly held to be unconstitutional on its face in prior cases, the supreme court concluded that defendant's sentence had to be vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his motions to suppress and for mistrial. The appellate court found that defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1001(f)(1) (Supp. 2000) had no application to the instant case as defendant's slurred and mumbled speech, bloodshot and watery eyes, the strong odor of alcohol, and evidence linking him with the operation of the vehicle that caused the collision constituted ample bases for probable cause to believe that he operated a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Defendant failed to show that admission of his blood alcohol test was unreasonable; even assuming admission of the test was error, it was harmless. As the juror's short discussion with a witness was an innocent contact on a topic unrelated to the prosecution, a mistrial was not warranted. Admitting the single autopsy photograph of the head and shoulder of the victim was not an abuse of discretion. Although it was error for the trial court to disallow the coroner's report of death as it was an official court record, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1982, defendant was sentenced, inter alia, to 3 to 10 years imprisonment for indecent liberties with a child. In 1999, defendant filed for post-conviction relief, claiming he should have been convicted of aggravated incest, as the child was his stepson. The district court denied relief. The Kansas Court of Appeals reversed. Upon remand, defendant received a 3 to 10 year prison sentence for aggravated incest. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was resentenced, pursuant to the authority of Carmichael. The Kansas Supreme Court held in Carmichael that the proper remedy for the petitioner's rape conviction of his daughter was to vacate the sentence imposed for rape and resentence the petitioner for aggravated incest. Defendant argued, inter alia, that he was deprived of due process by the district court's sentencing him for the uncharged and untried offense of aggravated incest. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit determined that the Kansas state courts' application of the Carmichael remedy comported with due process. Quoting Apprendi, the Tenth Circuit stated the relevant inquiry to be whether the required finding exposed the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury's guilty verdict. Here, application of the Carmichael remedy did not affect defendant's conviction, nor was he found guilty of and sentenced for an offense for which he was not charged and convicted. Due process under Apprendi was not violated, as defendant was resentenced within the allowable penalty range for aggravated incest, which did not result in a more severe sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the city was prohibited from proscribing his operation of a bicycle while under the influence of alcohol. Contrary to defendant's contention, the supreme court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-2001 authorized the city to expand the state's definition of &quot;vehicle.&quot; Further, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 8-1567, -1485 did not expressly authorize the operation of bicycles by those under the influence of alcohol. They merely failed to proscribe it. Consequently, no conflict existed between the city's ordinance and the state's statutes; thus, the ordinance was valid. However, while operating a bicycle under the influence violated the city code, it was not a DUI under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1567. Thus, such a conviction did not count for state sentencing purposes. Finally, the supreme court determined that the city's DUI ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague as it conveyed sufficient definite warning and fair notice as to the prohibited conduct in light of common understanding, and conveyed sufficient clarity to those who applied the ordinance standards to protect against arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the association contended that its two planes were exempt from property and ad valorem taxes pursuant to Kan.

Contrary to the arguments of the association, the supreme court determined that the issue in the instant case was not whether the planes were used exclusively to earn income; rather, the issue was whether the planes were actually and regularly used exclusively to earn income for the owner in the conduct of the owner's business or industry. The supreme court found that there were two simultaneous uses of the planes, for business and for rental income, one which fit the provisions of &sect; 79-201k and the other which failed to meet the statute's requirements. Thus, the planes were not actually and regularly used exclusively to earn income for the association in the conduct of the association's business.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners challenged a decision of the Shawnee District Court (Kansas), which denied their injunction petition and held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 19-101a (Supp. 2001), 19-3801 et seq., 19-4101 et seq. provided authority for appellee county's eminent domain action against the landowners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county sought by eminent domain to acquire the property of the landowners for purposes of industrial or economic development. The landowners sought an injunction, but the request was denied. An appraiser's report was filed and determined the compensation for the property in question. After the county paid the appraiser's award into the court, the amount was withdrawn. The court affirmed. It was not critical that the landowners withdrew the awards while continuing their appeal from the appraiser's award, as, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26-510(b), they were allowed to do so without prejudice to their right to appeal, which statute applied to their appeal in the injunction action. Although one of the landowners' buildings had been demolished and they withdrew the appraiser's award, the court did not find the injunction issue moot because of the general issue raised. The court agreed with the trial court's analysis and held that counties had and could exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire property for industrial or economic development purposes. The court found that the proceedings were valid in this case and the injunction was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

The legislature did not abolish the insanity defense but redefined it. The statute did not violate defendant's right to due process. Regarding defendant's argument that the Kansas &quot;mens rea approach&quot; to insanity unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to him on the issue of intent once the State offered proof of the other elements, there was no backing away from the requirement that the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense charged. Regarding defendant's argument that the trial court erred in failing to suppress his confession on the ground that he was actively delusional during the interview, there was substantial competent evidence supporting the conclusion that defendant's statements were not unknowing or involuntary due to his mental condition at the time of the interview.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3701 et seq. Appellant Kansas Department of Revenue appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department argued that the corporation's contacts in Kansas created a substantial nexus for imposing collection requirements under the Kansas Compensating Tax Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3701 et seq., the board failed to make certain factual findings and other findings were not supported by substantial evidence, the board improperly shifted the burden of persuasion to the department, and reasonable grounds for abating the penalties imposed by the department did not exist. The appellate court found that, although the corporation's Kansas independent service representatives (ISR's) did not have defined territories limited to Kansas, the distinction was one without constitutional significance. The sale of product by a Kansas ISR to an out-of state consumer was not subject to the Kansas sales or use tax. There was no impediment imposed upon interstate commerce. The lack of defined sales territories did not negate the physical presence that created a substantial nexus with Kansas sufficient to justify requiring the corporation to collect the tax. The ISR's did sell to Kansas residents, which helped developed the corporation's Kansas market.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court agreed. After stopping a car, a police officer found no drugs on the driver and had no probable cause to believe illegal drugs were in the car when defendant was told by the officer to get out of the car. Thus, at that point, the officer did not have probable cause to search defendant or her purse. The officer had no right to order her to leave her purse in the car. The State conceded at oral argument that, if defendant would have been allowed to take her purse with her, the officer could not have lawfully searched her or her purse. The protection of the Fourth Amendment could not be defined at the discretion of a law enforcement officer. Where a passenger was told by a police officer to get out of a lawfully stopped vehicle and, in response to the officer's order to leave her purse in the vehicle, put the purse down and exited the vehicle, a subsequent search of the purse as part of a search of the vehicle violated the passenger's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure.</SPAN></P>

The government interest outweighed defendant's diminished right for privacy in his genetic markers, as such information provided law enforcement with a dramatic tool that could be used to accurately identify a criminal suspect attempting to conceal his identity. Section 21-2511 was constitutional, as the minimally intrusive nature of providing blood and saliva samples was significantly outweighed by the State's interest in establishing and maintaining a statewide automated DNA database to search, match, and store DNA records.

Law enforcement officers gained entry to the club by telling defendant, the manager, to move out of the way or he would be arrested for obstruction. Defendant contended that the search was improper, as the officers gained entry by coercion. On appeal, the supreme court found that defendant's action constituted a refusal, as contemplated by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2613. However, the court interpreted &sect; 41-2613 to provide the sanction of license revocation as the exclusive sanction for refusing entry to duly authorized officers. The officers did not have authority to arrest defendant for obstruction of official duty, and an officer's overcoming defendant's resistance by threatening to arrest him amounted to gaining entry on false pretenses. Thus, the officers' entry and inspection was not authorized under &sect; 41-2613 and constituted an unlawful entry and search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee board of county commissioners sought injunctive relief in the Lincoln District Court, Kansas, against appellants, the county sheriff and a deputy sheriff, prohibiting the sheriff from employing the deputy and from making any purchase in excess of $ 250 without prior board approval. The district court granted the relief requested and the sheriff and deputy appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Twice the board discharged the deputy, and twice the sheriff continued his employment. The board also adopted a purchase policy limiting major sheriff's purchases without prior board approval. The district court ordered the deputy discharged, enjoined him from working or attempting to work for the county, and enjoined the sheriff from continuing his employment. In addition, the district court mandatorily enjoined the sheriff to comply with the purchase policy. On appeal the sheriff and deputy challenged the board's authority to terminate a deputy's employment and to require preapproval of expenditures by a sheriff. The appellate court held that board's actions constituted an attempt to change the sheriff's grant of authority under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-805(a) to appoint, promote, demote, and dismiss deputies, and that the board was prohibited under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-101a(a)(15) (2001 Supp.) from effecting such a change. Further, the court held that where a board of county commissioners approved a budget including necessary expenses, the sheriff could not be required to obtain advance approval for purchases within the limits of the approved budget regardless of the amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated the district court's injunction discharging the deputy, enjoining the deputy from working or attempting to work as a county employee, and enjoining the sheriff from continuing the deputy's employment, and reversed the district court and vacated its injunction prohibiting the sheriff from making any purchase in excess of $ 250 without prior board approval.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a constitutional challenge to the state scheme of financing public education, plaintiffs, numerous students and two school districts, sued defendants, the State, the governor, the chairperson of the Kansas State Board of Education, and the Commissioner of the Kansas State Department of Education. The Shawnee District Court, Kansas, sua sponte granted judgment to defendants. The students and the school districts appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the students and the school districts contended the trial court erred by excluding certain claims on the grounds that they were outside the pleadings, by failing to treat the dismissal of their case as a dismissal based upon a motion for summary judgment, and by concluding that they failed to present legally sufficient claims. The supreme court found the three issues of capital outlay, special education excess costs, and encroachment on the general supervision responsibility of the board were sufficiently raised and should have been considered by the trial court in its resolution of this case. Further, the trial court's judgment failed to address the factual allegations of the students and the school districts; thus, the supreme court concluded that there remained genuine issues of material fact not shown to be a sham, frivolous, or so unsubstantial that it would be futile to try the case. The issues raised in the case required the trial court to determine either on the basis of uncontroverted facts or on facts determined by trial whether the school financing provisions complained of were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

Claimants appealed, and the Kansas Workers Compensation Board reversed the ALJ and awarded benefits to claimants. The employer and its insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a nurse at a regional medical center who died after suffering a rupture of a cerebral aneurysm (stroke) at work. The employee worked in the intensive care unit and the emergency room, and she was required to help resuscitate dying patients. The expert testimony showed that running to respond to &quot;code blues,&quot; combined with the stress of code blue situations, probably combined to cause the employee's stroke. The Kansas Supreme Court held that: (1) there was not substantial competent evidence to support the board's finding of unusual exertion under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-501(e), as the employee was required to run in response to a code blue at least once a month as a part of her job duties; (2) stress did not qualify as an &quot;external factor,&quot; which would have made Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-501(e) irrelevant to the claim; and (3) Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-501(e) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, as the statute's purpose implicated a legitimate goal, and the means chosen by the legislature bore a rational relationship to that goal.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court had jurisdiction to correct illegal sentences at any time. An upward durational departure sentence imposed under &sect; 21-4716 was clearly vulnerable to constitutional attack, and the merits of that attack would be considered. The Kansas scheme for upward durational departure sentences was unconstitutional on its face. No authority provided by the State suggested that a defendant could submit by waiver to the application of an unconstitutional sentencing scheme. Defendant's upward departure sentence, even though a product of defendant's agreement with the State, was void and could not stand. Defendant pled guilty to a statutorily defined sexually violent crime. His extended post-release supervision period imposed pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3717(d)(1)(D)(i) did not offend Apprendi.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that defendant's extended postrelease period did not violate Apprendi and Gould. The appellate court held that a plea of guilty to a statutorily defined sexually violent crime provided the basis for an extended postrelease supervision period under Kan. Stat.

The letter made a demand for settlement of the claim in the amount of $ 1,000,000, and threatened a lawsuit if the demand was not met. The attorney was charged with false impersonation, because his license to practice law had been suspended in 1995 and had not been reinstated. Defendant argued on appeal that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court held that the question of the statute's constitutionality had been addressed in Marino and there was nothing unconstitutional about the statute.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3405. Defendant argued on appeal that the mere violation of a traffic statute or ordinance through inattention, without additional aggravating factors, did not support a conviction of vehicular homicide. The appellate court found that the amount of deviation from the standard of care was not sufficient to support defendant's conviction for vehicular homicide where defendant had not been drinking and was not under the influence of any drug, none of his passengers warned him as he was about to enter the intersection or were concerned that his driving appeared reckless or that he was accelerating or speeding as he approached the intersection, and defendant, who was not speeding, proceeded through the intersection thinking his light was green.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of crimes that required registration as a sex offender. The State charged each defendant with failing to comply with mandatory periodic address verification, the penalty for which had been changed from a misdemeanor to a felony since their convictions. The Shawnee District Court, Kansas, dismissed the complaints on the ground that the enhanced penalty was prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, the State argued that the key date for purposes of an ex post facto analysis was not the date of conviction of the crime requiring registration, but rather the date when defendants were alleged to have violated the registration statute. The evidence showed that the actual crimes with which defendants were charged occurred after the effective date of the amendment of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4903, which increased the penalty from a misdemeanor to a felony in 1999. Defendants were alleged to have failed to return address verification forms in June 2000 and thereafter. Thus, the supreme court determined that they could have conformed their conduct to the requirements of the amended registration statutes. The crime defendants were charged with was classed as a felony at the time each defendant allegedly committed it. Thus, the punishment had not been made more burdensome for defendants' violations of registration requirements after they failed to return the verification forms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among several traffic citations, defendant was charged with having no liability insurance in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-3104 when he was driving a car he did not own. With the understanding that defendant was charged with a violation of subsection (d) of that statute, the Ellsworth District Court, Kansas, dismissed the charge. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the supreme court found that the questions reserved by the State assumed that defendant was charged under the provisions of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-3104(d). However, the arresting officer referred to the statute without citing the specific subsection; thus, the charging document was sufficient to charge defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, with a violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-3104(c). The supreme court found that the facts surrounding the issuance of the citation supported this conclusion as defendant handed the officer a document indicating that the insurance on the vehicle had expired three weeks before. Given the fact that the questions reserved by the State related to a charge not actually involved in this case, the supreme court concluded that the trial court's disposition under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-3104(d) did not amount to an adverse legal ruling on issues of statewide interest important to the correct and uniform administration of the state's criminal laws. Therefore, dismissal was proper. Further, the alternative ruling of the trial court on the constitutionality of &sect; 40-3104(d) was not properly before the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a controversy between appellant city and appellee Kansas Department of Revenue involving a sales tax assessment for electricity consumed by the city in its delivery of water, the Kansas Court of Appeals reversed the Kansas Board of Tax Appeals' decision that additional retailers sales tax upon the electricity was due on the basis that to do otherwise denied the city equal protection under the United States Constitution. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A water treatment plant owned by the city provided water for the dual purpose of fire protection and furnishing water to consumers. The department conducted an audit of the city's electricity purchases used to power the treatment plant for the period of June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1995. Although requested to do so, the department declined to segregate the electricity purchases according to the percentage of the water used for governmental purposes and the percentage of the water sold to consumers. The department concluded that a 2.5 percent rate of taxation applied and found that the city's purchases for the period of time in question did not qualify for partial exemption from the sales tax. The instant court concluded that the city's equal protection argument failed because the city did not demonstrate that the treatment it received under the state's tax laws was the result of intentional systematic unequal treatment. Because the city was in the business of furnishing water, any electricity purchases used for that purpose did not qualify for the sale tax exemption. The board was correct in not prorating the purchases and in refusing to waive interest on the assessed tax.</SPAN></P>

The case was transferred to the instant court on its own motion, pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-3018(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In September 1999, defendant was charged. In October 1999, defendant entered into a diversion agreement with the State. The agreement had a 24-month term. In August 2001, defendant filed a motion for early successful discharge from diversion. The State objected to the early termination. On appeal, the State argued that the district court lacked authority to dismiss the complaint. Defendant argued that the State's notice of appeal was fatally flawed as the State failed to specify what it was appealing. The instant court concluded that the State's notice of appeal was sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the court of appeals as a matter of right from the dismissal of the complaint. The matter was before the instant court on a valid transfer from the court of appeals. Defendant's challenge to the instant court's jurisdiction to hear the State's appeal was without merit. The district court had no jurisdiction to dismiss the complaint over the State's objection because the 24-month term of the diversion agreement had not been successfully completed. There was nothing in the diversion agreement authorizing a shortening of the term of the agreement except to go to trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions to reinstate the diversion agreement and for a hearing to determine whether defendant had successfully completed the term of the diversion agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court erred in its response to a question submitted by the jury. The appellate court found that aggravated indecent liberties, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3504(a)(3)(A), required a touching. The videotaping of a child did not constitute a touching. The jury's question was covered by the court's instruction. The prosecutor sought to show that defendant's version of events was not feasible based on the victim's testimony at trial. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455, defendant's prior convictions were relevant as the two present crimes at issue were similar to his previous convictions. The alleged conduct squarely contradicted the issues of identity, motive, preparation, and plan and placed them in issue. The evidence supporting the conviction was sufficient to convict defendant. The district court erred in failing to remove from defendant's criminal history the sexually violent crime it used to qualify him as a persistent sex offender under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4704(j) (Supp. 1997).

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the fact the crimes were gang related, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4704a(k) (Supp. 2001), had to be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt before that fact could be used to impose a prison term rather than probation. The appellate court found that the district court's conclusion that defendant's crimes were gang related, triggering a presumptive prison sentence, did not increase the penalty for his crimes beyond the statutory maximum. Upon finding that the crimes were gang related, the district court imposed a presumptive prison term. The district court failed to make adequate findings on the record to support imposition of a prison term based on the fact that the crimes were gang related. The language of &sect; 21-4704a(k) contained an explicit statement of the showing required to trigger the presumptive prison sentence, including the defendant's specific intent to promote or assist certain conduct by gang members. The district court at the second sentencing hearing did not mention the statute. The district court did not find that defendant's crimes were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested 26 days after his release from a youth facility where he served a sentence arising from an adjudication on drug charges. Defendant was pulled over because he was driving without a vehicle license tag. When defendant admitted to driving on a suspended license, he was placed in custody, and the car was searched. A stolen gun was found in the passenger compartment. The trial court noted that defendant's criminal history and the severity score of the charged crime and, without notice, sentenced defendant to 15 months and refused to grant parole. The state supreme court affirmed the court of appeals and held that that United States Supreme Court decision in Apprendi did not apply to upward dispositional departures, as it would require a jury to make a finding beyond a reasonable doubt before any defendant falling within a presumptive probation gridbox could be denied probation. The court also held that while the trial court had substantial and compelling reasons for the upward dispositional departure based on the short time between defendant's release and his arrest, the case had to be remanded as the trial court did not give notice of its intention to depart.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff oil producers were directed to pay ad valorem taxes plus interest from 1983 to 1988. The producers sued defendant royalty owners for reimbursement of the taxes. The royalty owners claimed that the producers' claim was time barred by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-1624 (2001 Supp.). The Stevens District Court (Kansas) denied the producers' motion for summary judgment and they appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of the producers in its docketing statement answered affirmatively the question whether the order appealed from was a final order. Each indicated that invocation of the provisions of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-254(b) (2001 Supp.) was &quot;not applicable.&quot; Finally, in response to the question relating to statutory authority for appeal, each producer responded that the specific authority for its direct appeal was Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-2101(b). The trial court then appeared to acknowledge that there was at least one additional legal issue which remained to be resolved in the case at bar. The Supreme Court of Kansas's concern that the decision in the case at bar was not one which finally resolved all of the issues was strengthened when at oral argument counsel for the royalty owners admitted the recoupment and right to setoff issues remained and even if the statute of limitations had run the right of the producers to recover was still in issue. The trial court's decision and journal entry that its order was final and appealable was legally incorrect. It was not a final order. The supreme court did not have jurisdiction over the appeals or the cross-appeals.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. Contrary to defendant's position, the read-back testimony clearly and repeatedly stated that the times were approximations. The witness was asked approximately when he went on the first errand, and he responded that he left about 2 and returned at approximately 3 or 3:30. Regarding the second errand, the witness said that he left at approximately 4 and that he was not gone more than an hour, if that long. Defendant's admission on cross-examination that he was &quot;guesstimating&quot; was nothing more than a slight variation on the testimony that was read back to the jury. The read-back provided by the trial court satisfied the jury request insofar as it involved the times of the witness's errands. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

While such a comment appeared improper, it did not deprive defendant of a fair trial. Near the end of closing arguments the prosecutor said, &quot;in fact the detective can lie to a suspect, and it is perfectly acceptable, the detective could lie to all of us in an interview, but he did not about blood found on defendant's personal items.&quot; In context, it appeared the prosecutor was focusing on the importance of the blood evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant, who pled guilty in March 1996 to a drug felony in federal court argued that the commission's decision denying his application was not supported by substantial evidence; was contrary to undisputed evidence; and was unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. The applicant's earlier license had expired in June 1997. The commission denied the application based on the seriousness of the applicant's misconduct and his subsequent conduct. The instant court observed that there were no facts in the record that supported the commission's finding that the applicant was not rehabilitated. In fact, the evidence relevant to rehabilitation tended to show that the applicant was a useful and law-abiding member of society. The fact that the applicant was on supervised release was not, in and of itself, subsequent conduct of the applicant.  Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58-3043(a) required the commission to balance the applicant's conviction with other factors. However, it did not appear that the commission did so.

The supreme court disagreed. Before reaching his conclusions, the expert reviewed defendant's previous hospitalization information, military records, some psychiatric records, family history, police reports, witness statements, and police reports from past incidents. Regarding defendant's mental condition at the time of the victim's murder, the expert testified that defendant was psychotic, delusional, and suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. The State, on cross-examination, inquired about the information the expert had reviewed. The evidence was admitted to show errors in the expert's understanding of events upon which he based his opinion and to show the facts upon which he based his conclusions. The prosecutor was allowed to test the reasonableness of the expert's opinion during a proper cross-examination. Once the issue was raised on direct examination, the door was open, and cross-examination was not restricted to the identical details developed on direct examination or the specific facts testified to in direct examination.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that &sect; 79-201j was not unconstitutionally vague as the definition of &quot;farm equipment&quot; that included property that was actually and regularly used in any farming or ranching operation including the performing of farm or ranch work for hire was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the argument in the wife's brief of an unconstitutional application of the statute was not made to the trial court, and thus was not properly before the appellate court for review. The issues before the trial court did involve the application of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1610(a)(2) (2001 Supp.). The residential custody was continued in the father, although he enjoyed the assistance of his present wife in caring for the children, the residential custody was and remained with the father. The temporary transfer of a parent with residential custody did not automatically trigger a custody change. There was substantial and competent evidence to support the trial court's findings and rulings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The period of supervision was extended from 36 to 60 months based on the district court judge's post-conviction findings. Defendant argued the extended period of postrelease supervision constituted an unconstitutional upward durational departure. Defendant argued the district court imposed an upward durational departure sentence by subjecting him to the extended postrelease supervision period. The statutory maximum penalty for defendant's crime included a 36-month postrelease period. The supreme court ruled the district court's extension of defendant's postrelease period from 36 to 60 months increased the penalty for his crime beyond the statutory maximum. However, the conviction of aggravated indecent liberties constituted a substantial and compelling reason to impose the postrelease supervision departure and was an acceptable departure. Furthermore, the district court must rely on sentencing guidelines in effect on the date of the offense and erred when it looked to the presumptive range on the date of sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant. The appellate court found that the determination of whether the statements were made in reckless disregard of the risk of causing an evacuation of the courthouse was the primary issue for the jury to decide. Regardless of whether the threat was real or even capable of being carried out, it was the reaction desired by the communicator, or the communicator's reckless disregard of the possibility of creating that reaction which constituted the offense. Defendant told the witness that he was ready to assault the courthouse, and came across as an angry, desperate man on the edge of losing all control. There was nothing in the circumstances or actual statements made other than defendant's testimony at trial that supported his contention that the whole thing was a joke on his part. Defendant had elaborated his plan to the witness, and the fact that subsequent investigations revealed no evidence of defendant's capability to carry out his threats was not a factor in determining whether or not the threat was made in reckless disregard of the risk.</SPAN></P>

A criminal statute was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite unless its language conveyed a sufficiently definite warning of the conduct proscribed when measured by common understanding and practice. The appellate court found that a statute was not necessarily vague or overbroad simply because the legislature delegated the authority to determine what items constituted contraband to an agent or an agency. Procedural safeguards had to be in place in order to ensure that the statute was implemented in a constitutional manner. Due process required nondeceptive notice such that every person was able to know with certainty when he or she was committing a crime. The statute was not constitutionally inadequate on its face. The statute did not unlawfully delegate legislative authority in violation of the separation of powers doctrine, as a similar federal statute,&nbsp;18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1791 had withstood various constitutional challenges based upon the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion for postconviction relief, because under the Kansas Supreme Court's interpretation of felony murder, the defendant did not commit felony murder. The defendant argued that an opinion interpreting felony murder that was issued while the appeal was pending should have been retroactively applied to the defendant's postconviction motion. The supreme court disagreed. The decision should not have been retroactively applied as a matter of public policy under all the facts of the case. There clearly was a factual basis for the trial court to accept the defendant's plea. The trial court heard sufficient evidence from counsel's testimony to uphold the trial court's findings that the defendant was sufficiently advised of the potential penalties that he faced at the time of his plea. The defendant knowingly decided to take advantage of the favorable plea agreement. He was not coerced or pushed into doing so. He made the best of what was not a good situation that had every possibility of becoming much worse. Therefore, the trial court did not err by denying the motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4608(f)(5), a prisoner received no credit for time spent on parole on the aggregate sentence imposed when she committed a new offense while on parole. The Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) granted relief under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507, finding that the denial of credit was a violation of the Constitution's prohibition against double jeopardy and its requirement of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question on appeal was whether Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4608(f)(5) was unconstitutional as a violation of the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy and guarantee of due process and whether it conflicted with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3722. The State contended that the prisoner was not being punished twice for the same offense but was serving an enhanced sentence for the new crime. The appellate court held that the forfeiture of credit for time served on parole under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4608(f)(5) did not violate the prisoner's procedural due process rights. The consequences of &sect; 21-4608(f)(5) did not affect her until consecutive sentences were imposed for committing a new offense while on parole. The prisoner had fair notice. The amendment was effective for nearly eight years before she committed the act which triggered its application. No additional punishment was inflicted upon the prisoner by virtue of &sect; 21-4608(f)(5). The prisoner was returned to prison to complete her original sentence and her new sentence. There was no double jeopardy or due process issue. Section 21-4608(f)(5) was not unconstitutional nor did it conflict with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3722.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court should not have included his juvenile adjudications in his criminal history because they were the result of proceedings in which he did not have the right to a jury trial. The Court of Appeals decided that defendant's juvenile adjudications were correctly included in his Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act (KSGA), specifically Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4704 (2001 Supp.), criminal history score. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that juvenile adjudications included in a criminal history score increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum. He reasoned that under Apprendi, juvenile adjudications had to be charged in the indictment and proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Because the KSGA provided that juvenile adjudications could be included in the criminal history score absent those requirements, he contended the KSGA was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to his sentence. The supreme court held that Apprendi created an exception allowing the use of a prior conviction to increase a defendant's sentence based on the historical role of recidivism in the sentencing decision and on the procedural safeguards attached to prior convictions. Juvenile adjudications were included within the historical cloak of recidivism and enjoyed ample procedural safeguards; the Apprendi exception for prior convictions encompassed juvenile adjudications. Juvenile adjudications did not have to be charged in an indictment or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt before they could be used in calculating a defendant's criminal history score under the KSGA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, arson, impairing a security interest, and six counts of criminal solicitation, and he was sentenced to life. The Montgomery District Court (Kansas) also ordered an upward durational departure on the arson charge. The sentences were ordered to run consecutively. Defendant appealed and raised numerous issues including the admission of evidence of prior acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murdering his wife and then setting fire to her house. The autopsy showed that she died of manual strangulation prior to the fire. There was also evidence that his wife was lifted up by her neck. The supreme court held that venue in Montgomery County was proper, because it was the county where the defendant faced the original charges and it was the place where crimes were committed for which defendant solicited false testimony. The court also held that the trial court correctly admitted into evidence three categories of prior bad acts: violence against former wives, previous fires, and prior insurance claims made by the defendant. The similarities between the prior abusive acts and the facts of the case at bar were striking. As such, the evidence was relevant under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455 to prove a disputed, material fact at trial. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in imposing an upward departure sentence for the arson conviction, and the state conceded that an upward durational departure in a criminal sentence under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4716 (2001 Supp.) was unconstitutional and had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant pled guilty to seven sex crimes. The Wyandotte Count District Court (Kansas) ordered four of the seven sentences to run consecutively. The defendant appealed the sentences. The Kansas Court of Appeals dismissed the case on the basis that it had no jurisdiction to review a presumptive sentence and rejected the argument that the sentence was unconstitutional under Apprendi v. New Jersey. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the defendant raised the sole question of whether, under Apprendi, his constitutional rights were violated when the district court imposed consecutive sentences. The defendant asserted that the grounds on which the district court relied for imposing consecutive sentences, failure to fully accept his responsibility, were the same factual grounds the court rejected in denying the upward departure. The supreme court found no Apprendi violation and affirmed the court of appeals. In Apprendi, the United States Supreme Court held that, other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The supreme court found that the presumptive sentence imposed for each count was within the applicable sentencing guideline. The district court did not exceed the maximum sentence for any individual count. Therefore, it could not be said that, as to any individual count, the district court's findings resulted in the imposition of a greater punishment than was authorized by the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed tax protests involving eight tracts of pastureland situated in one county. The Kansas Board of Tax Appeals (BOTA) consolidated the appeals, joined the property valuation division as a necessary party, held a hearing, and denied the taxpayers' protest. The taxpayers appealed to the appellate court, and the appeal was transferred on the Kansas Supreme Court's own motion under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-3018(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged the methodology used by the Director of Property Valuation (PVD) of Kansas Department of Revenue to value agricultural land, and contended it was not in compliance with the statutory requirements of Kan. Stat.

The Kansas Supreme Court found that: (1) there was substantial evidence to uphold BOTA's findings that PVD was following statutory guidelines in utilizing the districts for purposes of gathering valid statistical information and it met the statutory requirements of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-1476, (2) the PVD formula provided a sufficiently accurate net rental income to be used in determining the use value of pastureland, (3) a reasonable interpretation of the statute supported a dual meaning of classification and land classes, and (4) based on the limited and conflicting evidence presented BOTA reached a correct result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for the murder of his girlfriend. Defendant asserted that his use of crack cocaine affected his mental state and that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that the effect of a verdict of not guilty of first-degree murder due to a mental disease or defect would result in defendant's being committed to the state hospital rather than released. The supreme court rejected defendant's argument, finding that the verdict form permitted the jury to find defendant not guilty of premeditated first degree murder or guilty of any of four lessor included offenses. Moreover, defendant failed to object to the verdict form, and his counsel failed to raise the insanity defense. The supreme court also held that it was not necessary for the State to give notice of intent to request a hard 40 sentence under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4635(a) or notice of the aggravating factors on which it would rely, because evidence presented by the State at trial was known to defendant and was admissible for hard 40 sentencing purposes.

The Wyandotte District Court denied the company's petition for a permanent injunction. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county moved for an order to allow entry upon the company's land to perform environmental testing. The district court order allowed the county to enter the company's property to perform the environmental testing without requiring an easement or paying the company for the use of its land. The company argued that the statutory authority that allowed the county to enter its property and conduct tests in an eminent domain proceeding did not include the right to perform extensive environmental testing. The company argued also that it was inappropriate to have the same judge sit for both the condemnation proceeding and the injunction petition. The state supreme court held it did not create a conflict to allow a judge to sit in both proceedings and review his own orders. The court found the company met the elements to obtain an injunction, as the testing and its results could cause the company to suffer irreparable harm that would affect the ongoing nature of its business. As the county proposed the testing not to correct an environmental problem, but to determine the economic viability of the land, no statutory authority existed to allow the subsurface testing to occur.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies requested permission to amend corporate tax returns and to file a combined report as a unitary business. The department determined that the parent company could not establish its right to file a combined return, as it did not own more than 50 percent of the subsidiary company. The companies appealed the department's decision. The Board of Tax Appeals (BOTA) found that the operations of the two companies were functionally integrated and centrally managed by the parent company. The subsidiary company's operations were intertwined with the parent company to meet its necessary specifications for pipeline operations. The parent company also was the subsidiary company's sole source of legal, tax planning, preparation services, and helped with its employee stock plan. The department asserted its decision was entitled to judicial deference by BOTA. The appellate court held that BOTA properly applied a de novo standard of review to the department's decision. As Kansas did not apply a bright line test for a unitary business, and the two companies shared such an interdependent relationship so as to form one integral business, BOTA's determination was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant killed the victim after breaking into her home and trying to rape her. One of the aggravating factors that the jury considered was that the defendant killed the victim because she was able to identify him. The defendant raised 43 issues on appeal. The appellate court held that no errors were committed by the trial court with respect to the admission of the confession, the specificity of the search warrant, the determination of competency, the selection of jurors, the jury instructions, juror misconduct, or alleged prosecutorial misconduct, thus a new trial was not warranted. The appellate court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4624(e) was unconstitutional as applied; in that it required the jury to issue a death sentence, if they found that aggravating and mitigating factors were in equipoise. As such, the death sentence was vacated. The court also held that the verdict form also warranted vacating the death sentence, as the verdict form erroneously informed the jury that it had to unanimously agree that a sentence other than death should be imposed. The prosecutor's misconduct during closing arguments and sentencing did not constitute reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed. The death sentence was vacated, and the matter was remanded for a sentencing hearing consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stipulated facts were that defendant offered money and a new car to a former employee for the former employee's newborn child. The supreme court found it was clear that it was the legislative intent that all fees, expenses, or other consideration received not meeting one of the six exceptions provided for under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2121(a) would be &quot;clearly excessive&quot; and a violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2121(c), where the excessive fees or expenses were received or accepted knowingly or intentionally. The fact that defendant had not yet received the money she bargained for in brokering the child when law enforcement officials stepped in did not change the nature of the transaction. Defendant brokered a deal for the sale of the child in a three-way transaction. Defendant requested a fee for her services in putting the deal together. Buyers, seller, and broker accepted the terms thereof, and the child was transferred under the agreed-upon terms. Consequently, defendant's conduct constituted knowingly and intentionally receiving or accepting clearly excessive fees or expenses in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2121(a), as set forth in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2121(c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions entered in the Wyandotte District Court (Kansas) for first-degree premeditated murder of his grandmother and battery of his girlfriend. The district court imposed a hard 40 sentence under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4636(c),(f), finding that the murder was a crime committed for the purpose of receiving money or other thing of monetary value and was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered his grandmother with five gunshots. On appeal, the first issue was whether there was sufficient evidence of aggravating circumstances for the imposition of the hard 40 sentence. The supreme court found that there was sufficient evidence to show that the murder was committed for the purpose of receiving money or any other thing for monetary value, an aggravating circumstance. However, the supreme court noted that shooting deaths were generally not considered committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner. The supreme court concluded that unlike the victims in other shooting death cases where a hard 40 sentence was imposed, the victim in the instant case was not chased down, nor forced to lie on the floor awaiting death. The shooting took place within 1 minute. Therefore, the evidence did not support a finding that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner. Finally, the appellate court rejected defendant's claims that the district court erred in determining defendant's girlfriend, an eyewitness, was unavailable and allowed her preliminary hearing transcript to be used as evidence at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's hard 40 sentence was vacated, and the matter was remanded to the district court for reweighing of the one remaining aggravating circumstance and the mitigating circumstance of no significant history of prior criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant pled guilty to drug possession charges, and was sentenced to 64 months, which was double the presumptive sentence for the primary offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In upholding the defendant's sentence, the court of appeals held that the case of Apprendi v. New Jersey did not apply because the primary facts upon which the defendant's upward departure sentence was based were proven beyond a reasonable doubt by his admissions and pleas of guilty. On appeal, the defendant argued that the imposition of an upward departure sentence was unconstitutional, as the sentencing court based its sentence upon his admissions, not upon facts found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury. The defendant contended that under Apprendi his guilty plea to the elements of the offense was not an admission that the sentencing factors used to increase his sentence were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The supreme court's review of the record showed that the sentencing court failed to reveal the precise statute relied upon for its upward departure. The supreme court noted that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4716 (2000), which granted judges the authority to depart from a presumptive sentence, had been found unconstitutional in a prior decision. Therefore, the supreme court reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing following that prior decision.</SPAN></P>
