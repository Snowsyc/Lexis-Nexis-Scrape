</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school boards sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Leon County, which denied appellants' challenge to the 2004-2005 General Appropriations Act, ch. 2004-268, Laws of Fla (Act). The Act changed the method used to calculate the Florida Price Level Index (FPLI), and appellants received a smaller increase in their public school funding than they would have received under the previous calculation method.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the 2004-2005 Act, the Florida Legislature approved state appropriations for school districts, and the Act adopted a new FPLI index recommendation that took into consideration the role of amenities in the FPLI. Appellants brought an action for declaratory judgment, naming appellees the Florida Department of Education, the Florida Legislature, and the State Board of Education as defendants. Other parties intervened as both plaintiffs and defendants in the proceedings. The lawsuit challenged the authority of the state entities, under &sect; 1011.62(2), Fla. Stat. to select and designate a particular version of the FPLI and challenged the attempt to implement the amenities-based price level index. The trial court eventually dismissed all of the counts in the complaint. The court agreed with the trial court that no evidence had been presented to support the contention that the Florida Legislature violated Art. III, &sect; 12, Fla. Const. when it passed the Act. The court agreed with the trial court that Art. IX, &sect; 1, Fla. Const. was not violated in this case, but disagreed that Art. IX, &sect;&nbsp;1, Fla. Const. never provided for a private right of action against the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the rulings of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated matters, appellant corporation sought review of eight orders entered by appellee, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), in four separate administrative actions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose between the corporation and the HMO about the rates that the HMO would be required to reimburse the corporation after the contract between the parties was terminated. The corporation voluntarily agreed to submit the matters to the resolution organization pursuant to &sect; 408.7057, Fla. Stat. (2002). The resolution organization agreed with the HMO about the reimbursement rates, and the AHCA entered orders that were consistent with the resolution organization's recommendations, pursuant to &sect; 408.7057, Fla. Stat. (2002). The court held that the corporation's due process rights were not violated because its due process rights did not extend to the voluntary private conduct of the dispute resolution procedure, even when the dispute resolution process was created by statute. The due process requirements normally afforded to administrative proceedings under &sect;&sect; 120.569 and 120.57, Fla. Stat. (2002) were not applicable to the proceeding initiated under &sect; 408.7057, Fla. Stat. (2002). The court also found that the orders of the AHCA should not be reversed, under the limited scope of review afforded to the court under &sect; 120.68, Fla. Stat.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders made by the AHCA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer sued appellee insureds, seeking a declaratory judgment that the loss to the insureds' home resulting from a hurricane was caused primarily by flooding. The insureds counterclaimed for policy limits pursuant to former &sect; 627.702(1), Fla. Stat. (2004), of the Florida Valued Policy Law (VPL). The Circuit Court for Santa Rosa County, Florida, granted the insureds judgment on the pleadings. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A hurricane left the insureds' home a total loss. As wind and water both contributed, and the policy excluded flood damage, the insurer argued that its liability should be reduced. The trial court held that under the version of &sect; 627.702(1) in effect at the time of the loss, as there was a total loss of a structure that was insured as to a covered peril, the insurer's liability was in the amount for which the property was insured, even if a non-covered peril also contributed to the total loss. The appellate court agreed. Though the legislature amended &sect; 627.702 to change such a result, it specifically made the amendment prospective only. The language of former &sect; 627.702(1) was unambiguous, and the appellate court lacked the authority to amend the VPL to render it nugatory when multiple perils combined to destroy an insured structure. Any provisions of the insurance policy that conflicted with the former VPL were nugatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate appealed the order of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which denied his petition for writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the inmate raised three arguments. In the third argument, the inmate challenged the propriety of the trial court order placing a lien on his inmate trust account as a condition of his going forward with his petition for writ of mandamus. The inmate's petition for writ of mandamus challenged the disciplinary action taken against him by the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC), which resulted in the inmate's forfeiture of 30 days of gain-time. Under the circumstances, the inmate's petition qualified as a collateral criminal proceeding and his indigency determination should have been made pursuant to &sect; 57.081, Fla. Stat. The trial court order incorrectly relied on &sect; 57.085, Fla. Stat. to justify the imposition of a lien on the inmate's trust account. In addition to the lack of statutory authority for imposing a lien, case law indicated that such a lien was unauthorized, and appellee, the Secretary of the DOC, conceded that point.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed, without comment, the inmate's first and second arguments on appeal. To the extent that the trial court's order called for the imposition of a lien on the inmate's trust account, it was reversed. The matter was remanded to the trial court for entry of an order removing the lien from the inmate's trust account.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) that, inter alia, denied his motion to suppress; defendant claimed that he had been detained without a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputy observed two black males at a closed strip mall, looking around the corner towards a convenience store. When the deputy attempted to make contact, the men took off running. As they neared their vehicle, the deputy observed that they were wearing dark colored bandanas tied &quot;Old West style&quot; around their noses and covering the lower half of their faces. After backup arrived, the men were arrested on the scene for loitering and prowling. A pat-down search of defendant yielded a magazine for a semiautomatic style handgun. The handgun was found under the driver's seat and a BB style or pellet gun was found on the ground outside the passenger door. The appellate court found that the initial encounter between the deputy and defendant constituted a valid investigatory stop because the deputy had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was loitering in violation of &sect; 856.021(2), Fla. Stat. (2001). Even if defendant's arrest for loitering and prowling were invalid, the arrest was still valid since the facts known to the officer would have supported his arrest on a valid, alternative basis. Consequently, the trial court properly denied his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) denied defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence, in which he claimed that (1) the statute relied upon to enhance his sentence was declared unconstitutional as violative of the single-subject rule in 1993, and (2) there was insufficient evidence presented to establish that he qualified to be sentenced as an habitual violent felony offender. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a review of the record on appeal and as to defendant's first claim, the instant court held that because defendant was sentenced pursuant to a negotiated plea, the claim amounted to an attack regarding the voluntariness of his plea which had to be brought pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 as a motion to vacate his sentence. But, given that more than two years had passed since defendant's conviction became final, he was procedurally barred from raising such a motion. Further, the court held that even if it were to rule that the claim was properly before the court, the sentence was an habitual offender's sentence which was not affected by the amendment to &sect; 775.084, Fla. Stat. Second, because the prior felony convictions, two robberies, occurred within five years of the sentencing at issue and were qualifying offenses for purpose of enhancement under &sect; 775.084, the trial court correctly denied defendant relief on this claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) granted defendant's motion to dismiss the information filed against him which charged three counts of felony child abuse, under &sect; 827.03(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2004), finding that defendant's verbal conduct against the three minor victims was not actionable under said statute. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged the judgment entered. The instant court held that it disagreed with the Fourth District Court of Appeals case relied on by the trial court, as well as a later Fourth District case on the same issue, that to withstand an overbreadth challenge to &sect; 827.03(1), Fla. Stat. (2004), it had to construe the statute to avoid its application to all speech. If &sect; 827.03(1) could be construed to be applicable only to specifically described unprotected speech, it could withstand an overbreadth challenge. Further, the trial court was not asked to, nor did it, address the question of whether the information filed against defendant could withstand a challenge on these grounds. Thus, the judgment entered was reversed, and the trial court was directed to address this issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded. Further, a conflict was certified to the Florida Supreme Court with two Fourth District opinions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Okaloosa County (Florida) convicted defendant of possession of cannabis, possession of a controlled substance without a prescription, and resisting arrest without violence. The court also entered a final order denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized from his person upon an arresting officer's detention. Defendant appealed said order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to suppress all the evidence seized, arguing that the deputy had no legal justification to detain him, or once detained, the deputy had no legal justification to continue to detain him. The trial court disagreed, explaining that it was reasonable for the deputy to require each party the deputy confronted, including defendant, to produce identification before being released. When defendant failed to produce any identification and lied about his name, the deputy was authorized to arrest him and to conduct a search incident to the arrest. Further, believing that a minor collision had occurred, that the deputy had probable cause to investigate. On appeal, the court agreed with this reasoning. Because the deputy had probable cause to detain defendant, it was irrelevant that his primary concern during his investigation was the prevention of domestic violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying suppression was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction, contending that the &quot;statutory rape law&quot; was facially unconstitutional, in that it violated due process by failing to require proof that a defendant knew the minor's age. The appeals court disagreed, given the clear and unambiguous language in Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;794.021 (2003), which provided that ignorance or belief as to a victim's age was no defense. In keeping with the statute, the jury instructions did not require any finding that defendant knew the victim's age, and defendant voiced no objection to the instructions given. But, defendant filed, and the trial court denied, a motion to dismiss, urging the unconstitutionality of the statute for failure to require the State to prove scienter. Further, cases cited by defendant concerning whether, in construing a criminal statute that was silent on the subject, a mens rea requirement should be inferred, were inapposite. Even in jurisdictions where statutes were written so that courts had to decide whether legislatures intended to make knowledge of the minor's age an element of the offense, decisions on the point overwhelmingly sided against defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee agency filed a petition to terminate appellant father's parental rights pending adoption pursuant to &sect; 63.087, Fla. Stat. The Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) terminated the father's parental rights. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the father's consent to adoption was not required as he failed to comply with &sect; 63.054, Fla. Stat. and that, since his consent was not required, the agency was entitled to the judgment terminating his parental rights. The appellate court held that, since the father failed to register, his consent to the adoption was not required and the grounds for termination listed in &sect; 63.089(3), Fla. Stat. did not apply to him. In its petition, the agency admitted that the father was not a parent as defined by statute.&nbsp;Section 63.087(5), Fla. Stat. did not contemplate that one such as the father would have been a party to a termination action. While the trial court found that the father's consent was not required due to his failure to register, it nevertheless terminated his parental rights pursuant to &sect; 63.089(3), Fla. Stat. This was error. Section 63.089(3), Fla. Stat. did not apply to the father since his consent was not required and he was not a parent. Thus, the trial court erred in terminating the rights, if any, of a party not properly contemplated by the statute stated. Due to the fundamental nature of the error, it was addressed although it was unpreserved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded with direction to the trial court on remand to first consider the pending paternity action to determine whether the father met the statutory definition of a parent, which would have determined whether his consent to the adoption was required. Only then could the termination and adoption proceedings have been addressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipalities sued appellee charter county in the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief in a challenge to the validity of an amendment to the county's charter. The trial court, at summary judgment, found that the charter amendment was partially valid but contained three invalid provisions which the trial court severed. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county commission approved an ordinance to amend the county's charter to provide an exclusive method of voluntary municipal annexation for the county. A majority of the electorate of the county approved the amendment. The trial court ruled that certain portions of the amended charter contained a valid voluntary municipal annexation method but found that three provisions of the amendment were invalid. On appeal, the court found that the trial court correctly interpreted &sect; 171.044(4), Fla. Stat. (2004) to allow charter counties to provide their own method of voluntary annexation. Moreover, the trial court correctly found that the requirement in &sect; 171.044(4) that the exclusive method of voluntary annexation be contained in the charter itself was violated by allowing the county commission to use an ordinance to accomplish the same goal. Thus, three provisions of the charter amendment were correctly severed because they were invalid as they allowed the county commission to define the exclusive method of voluntary municipal annexation for unincorporated areas not designated as either an unincorporated protection area or an unincorporated rural neighborhood by ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Incident thereto, the officers found a clear plastic baggie containing cocaine and pills known as Xanax. Defendant told the officers that the pills belonged to his girlfriend. At trial, however, he testified that he found the pills in the car, which belonged to his boss, and he pocketed them to prevent his children from exposure, with the intention of returning them to his boss. The trial court declined to give defendant's requested jury instruction on lawful disposition--brief possession plus an innocent intent to dispose of them--since his children had been picked up by their mother 10 hours before the Xanax was discovered. The jury convicted defendant on the possession of cocaine and of a controlled substance. On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court did not err in declining to give his requested lawful disposition instruction since the facts did not support a finding of brief possession and an innocent intent to dispose.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the trial court judgment and sentence. The absence of a definition of poison did not make &sect; 859.01&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague. Relying upon dictionaries that defined poison, in effect, as a substance that causes injury, illness, or death, the appellate court concluded that the term had a plain, ordinary, and accepted meaning that could be understood by a person of ordinary intelligence to place that person on notice of forbidden conduct. The failure to indicate a required dosage did not make &sect; 859.01&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague or encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement because the legislature could not be expected to list every possible harmful substance. Defendant's argument regarding unconstitutional application was waived because it was not raised before her motion for a new trial, but in any event &sect; 859.01 was not unconstitutional as applied to her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, St. Lucie County (Florida) of child abuse and solicitation to commit aggravated battery. He was sentenced to five years on each count, to be served consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The allegations in the case stemmed primarily from two telephone conversations between defendant and his son, who said defendant asked him twice to go in the kitchen, get a knife, and stab his mother. Defendant argued that his child abuse conviction had to be vacated because oral statements alone could not support a conviction for child abuse under &sect; 827.03(1)(b), Fla. Stat. (2003). The appeals court agreed. Section 827.03(1)(b) prohibited &quot;an intentional act&quot; which was seemingly an attempt to outlaw the act that inflicted the harm, not the actual harm itself. However, the statute contained no parameters or guidelines as to what constituted an act under the statute. Therefore, in reference to speech which constituted an intentional act or conduct, any statements by a parent or teacher directed towards a child which could cause mental injury would be subject to prosecution as child abuse. Thus, it appeared that the statute actually outlawed a result derived from any act, making the statute applicable to a wide range of acts causing a &quot;physical or mental injury upon a child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded and the trial court was directed to enter a judgment of acquittal for the child abuse charge. Defendant's other issues on appeal concerning prejudicial evidence were not preserved and did not represent fundamental error. Accordingly, his conviction for solicitation to commit aggravated battery was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a disciplinary proceeding, appellee State of Florida, Division of Administrative Hearings, Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, found that appellant pest-control technician applied a deficient concentration of a pesticide used for the prevention of subterranean termites in violation of Fla. Stat. &sect;&sect; 482.051(5), 482.161(1)(e), and Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 5E-14.106(6). The technician sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The technician alleged, inter alia, that the rule was applied inconsistently. The appellate court found that there was no specific rule detailing how staff, under these circumstances, should have conducted internal procedure in investigating, reviewing, and deciding to bring a complaint, but that each case was processed on a case by case basis. There was no dispute that the department required compliance with the rule as to pesticide concentration, or that the technician failed to comply. The technician did not contend he was without notice that his failure to apply the required concentration could have resulted in a penalty. There was no deviation from internal policy in the process followed in preparing and deciding to file the complaint. A person subject to department discipline had no statutory right to have the case investigated and reviewed in a specific manner. Baker objected to administrative discussions during the investigation and charging process. There was no meeting of a public collegial body. Communication among administrative staff in fulfilling investigatory, advisory, or charging functions did not constitute a &quot;Sunshine&quot; Law violation.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court agreed. It was evident from the record evidence that defendant made telephone calls to the victim's business telephone line, located in the victim's home where he conducted his business. Although the victim enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy in his home, that expectation was not extended to his business phone, despite such being in his home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian challenged the judgment entered. While the appeals court found that he had standing to bring the false imprisonment claim, at issue was whether the hospital was entitled to immunity from said claim for actions it took in reliance upon an order that was later determined to have been entered in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction. The appeals court held that it was not. Its actions were taken neither during the course of the judicial proceedings nor in an effort to prosecute or defend its lawsuit. Additionally, the appeals court disagreed with the hospital's claim that because it acted in reliance on a court order, it should be cloaked with qualified or quasi-judicial immunity to the same extent as that afforded to state agents executing the order of a trial court, as the hospital was not an agent of the government executing an order of the court. Instead, by procuring and obtaining the order allowing the deportation of the ward so that he could receive the much needed medical care in Guatemala, the hospital was seeking the vindication or enforcement of a purely private right.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 86 (2005), claiming the citizens' proposed amendments to the city charter that they intended to place on the ballot were invalid. The Circuit Court for Pinellas County, Florida, ruled that three of the four proposed amendments were preempted by Fla. Stat. ch. 163 (2005). The city and citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed amendments stated that unanimous city commission approval would be required to approve comprehensive land use plans or plan amendments affecting five or fewer parcels (petition II); that voter approval was required for approval of or effectiveness of a community redevelopment plan (petition I), an increase in allowable height of structures (petition III), or a comprehensive land use plan or comprehensive land use plan amendment (petition IV). The trial court held that petitions I, III, and IV were preempted by Fla. Stat. ch. 163. The appellate court initially held that the trial court had jurisdiction to make a pre-election determination of the facial constitutionality of the proposed amendments. None of the amendments were facially unconstitutional or unconstitutional in their entirety, not because they merely added another step in an already detailed process, but because they were inferentially permitted by Fla. Stat. &sect; 163.3167(12) (2005). Petition II would establish only an internal procedural rule as to the number of commissioners who had to agree on an amendment affecting five or fewer parcels; this requirement was not a &quot;referendum&quot; proscribed by &sect; 163.3167(12)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment approving petition II, reversed the judgment invalidating petitions I, III, and IV, and remanded with instructions for the trial court to enter judgment in favor of the citizens and to order the city to place all four of the proposed amendments on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question was whether the State was authorized under the Ryce Act to seek to involuntarily commit to the Department for care and treatment, a person who had been convicted of a sexually violent crime in the past and who was brought into &quot;total confinement,&quot; as that term was defined, after January 1, 1999, for any crime, sexual or non-sexual in nature. The prisoner had been convicted of several rapes in the past. His most recent crime was for burglary. The appellate court held the scope of the second clause of the Ryce Act encompassed otherwise qualifying sexual offenders whether or not they were then incarcerated for a sexual or non-sexual offense. Although the appellate court believed a sound reading of the text and correct application of the rules of statutory construction impelled the result it reached, it also believed its construction of the statute comported with the history and purpose behind the Ryce Act. Thus, the prisoner could be declared a &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; and involuntarily committed to the Department under Fla. Stat. &sect; 394.925.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review of a non-final order from the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida), which granted partial summary judgment in favor of appellee investors in the investors' lawsuit brought against the county under the Bert J. Harris, Jr. Act (Act), Fla. Stat. &sect; 70.001 (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1984 and 1987, the investors purchased two adjoining parcels of land. The property was over four acres, with a wetlands area in the center of about one acre. In September 2000, the county adopted an ordinance that restricted commercial land development activities on property, such as the investors', which contained wetlands. The investors submitted a notice of claim to the county when they could not sell the property to a developer, pursuant to the Act, because they claimed that the value of the property was reduced by the county ordinance. The trial court granted the investors' motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. The court found that the Act was constitutional and did not violate due process. The Act did not affect the inherent power of the county to exercise its sovereign power, but merely required the government to provide relief to a property owner when the action reduced property values. The Act did not violate the separation of powers because it contained sufficient provisions to enable a court to make the determinations required under the Act. The trial court did not make sufficient findings as required by Fla. Stat. &sect; 70.001(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court to the extent that it found that the Act was constitutional. The court reversed the decision of the trial court to the extent that it did not make findings of fact as required under the Act, and remanded the matter for additional findings.</SPAN></P>

The court observed that the maximum penalty for a violation of Lakeland, Florida, Code, &sect; 78-4, (1960), was 60 days, and that the record did not reflect that petitioner had been arraigned. The court therefore held that because petitioner had been held for as long as possible on the panhandling charge had he been convicted of the ordinance violation, the granting of his petition was required as to that case. The court declined to address petitioner's contention that the municipal ordinance was unconstitutional, holding that because the case could be disposed of on other grounds, the constitutional question should not be addressed.</SPAN></P>

The putative class representatives moved for class certification. The trial court certified a class and one subclass under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(b)(2) and Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(b)(3). On appeal, the appellate court found that the putative class representatives' claims did not meet the requirements for class certification under either of those rules. For instance, the appellate court found that some proposed members sustained damages to their residence while some sustained no such damage. It also found that the putative class representatives alleged no less than 14 separate deceptive or unfair practices, and that the trial court's solution for proving damages was a potential denial of the parent company and subsidiary's substantive due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant sought review of a final order of the Florida Judge of Compensation Claims (JCC), which denied the stipulated attorney's fees requested. The claimant and appellees, the employer and the insurance carrier had entered into a stipulated agreement concerning the fees to be paid. The JCC found that the fees were in excess of those allowed by Fla. Stat. &sect; 440.34(1) (2004). Instead, the JCC approved the fee permitted by &sect; 440.34(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant contended that Fla. Stat. &sect; 440.34(1) should be construed to allow a fee that exceeded the mandated percentage on the benefits secured, and that &sect; 440.34 violated the Florida Constitution. The court held that the JCC properly construed &sect;&nbsp;440.34(1), because the statute clearly set forth the formula for setting the fees based upon the amount of benefits secured. The JCC could not accept the stipulation when &sect; 440.34(1) expressly prohibited the approval of the fee that was in excess of the fee provisions. Fla. Stat. &sect; 440.34(1) did not violate the equal protection clause or the due process clause because the statute had a reasonable relationship to the state's interest in regulating fees to preserve the benefits awarded to the claimant. Section 440.34(1) was not discriminatory, arbitrary, or oppressive because it applied to all workers' compensation claimants and did not impinge upon the right to be represented by counsel. Fla. Stat. &sect; 440.34 did not impermissibly restrict the right to freely contract, because the section was enacted to protect claimants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the JCC. The court certified a question for review by the Florida Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Lee County (Florida), which granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, a class of persons who executed land development or sale contracts but did not qualify for a school impact fee exemption, and determined that the county's school impact fee ordinance, Lee County, Fla., Ordinance No. 01-21, constituted a facially unconstitutional impairment on construction contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The declaratory judgment action sought a determination that the assessment of the fee constituted an unconstitutional impairment of plaintiffs' contract rights under the contract clause of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, both facially and as applied. The trial court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs upon a finding that Lee County, Fla., Ordinance No. 01-21 was facially unconstitutional because it impaired the contract clause. The Ordinance allegedly placed an impermissible burden on contracts as to all plaintiffs who executed contracts prior to the effective date for purposes of fee payment. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred, as there were circumstances under which the Ordinance validly required payment of the fee prior to the issuance of building permits. Further, the facial validity determination was not limited to contracts executed prior to the effective date, and there were instances after such time where the fee was valid. The as-applied challenge had not been reached by the trial court. On remand, the court directed the trial court regarding which balancing test to apply from varying judicial precedents for purposes of a contract impairment determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action filed under Florida's Lemon Law, Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;681.10 et seq. (2001), the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit Court, Broward County (Florida), entered judgment in favor of appellee buyer, adopting the arbitration award. In an amended final judgment, the court awarded the buyer double damages, pursuant to Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;681.1095(13) (2001) and attorney's fees. The seller appealed from both orders, and the buyer moved to dismiss the same.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer moved to dismiss the seller's two appeals unless the seller complied with the trial court's order to pay its attorney's fees. The appeals court stayed the appeals on the merits to consider the seller's contention that Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;681.1095(14) was unconstitutional. The court held that it was, finding a violation of both Fla. Const. art. V, &sect;&nbsp;4 and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, as the statute failed to provide a manufacturer with an alternative remedy for appeal or a commensurate benefit. A manufacturer's appeal was heard only after paying the consumer's attorney's fees; the manufacturer received no benefit from paying the fees. Second, the statute lacked reciprocity because it did not require consumers to pay a manufacturer's attorney's fees if the appeal proved meritorious. Third, imposing an onerous attorney's fee requirement on the right to appeal was not the only method that a statute could utilize to encourage a timely resolution of a consumer problem with a motor vehicle. The requirements of Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;681.1095(14) went well beyond those minimal appellate cost bonds that the Florida Supreme Court upheld as a valid exercise of legislative power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss the appeal was denied, and that portion of the trial court's order compelling the seller to pay the buyer's attorney's fees as a condition to further appeal was quashed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a class action lawsuit seeking tax refunds, the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) denied summary judgment to appellant, the State of Florida Department of Revenue (Department), and granted the same, in part, to appellee taxpayers. The Department and the taxpayers both appealed from the decisions entered against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department appealed the judgment entered against it but merely reiterated issues already considered and rejected by the instant court. Thus, the law of the case doctrine precluded reconsideration of these issues. The taxpayers' cross-appeal contended that the final judgment improperly limited the relief granted to appellee husband and wife and those who filed individualized claims with the Department or affirmatively intervened in the action within three years of paying the unconstitutional tax. Thus, they argued that the relief granted should have extended to those who had paid the unconstitutional tax within the three years after the instant action had commenced, regardless of whether an administrative remedy had been pursued. The appeals court found that the trial court did not apply the law of the case when it limited the relief to members of the class who had timely filed for a refund. Hence, the matter was remanded so that the final judgment applied to all taxpayers who paid the unconstitutional tax within the three years when this action was commenced, regardless of whether they filed an administrative action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the final judgment, insofar as the doctrine of the law of the case prevented the Department from reasserting its previously rejected positions, was affirmed. However, that portion of the taxpayers' cross-appeal that conflicted with the instant court's prior decision in Leon was reversed, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's findings that the ballot met the requirements of Fla. Stat. &sect; 101.161 (2005) and that the petition in support of the referendum was properly notarized. As for the proposed amendment, the trial court had found that it removed the Miami-Dade County Commission as the &quot;governing body&quot; under Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6(e), n.3.  The court held that the trial court erred. Under the proposed amendment, the Commission retained all of the powers afforded to it under the present charter. Moreover, Fla. Stat. &sect; 125.01(1) (2005) enumerated the powers of a &quot;legislative and governing body.&quot; There was no dispute that the Commission presently possessed the bulk of those powers, and it would continue to exercise them under the proposed amendment. The proposed changes would transfer to the mayor a great deal of control over the administration of county government; however, these administrative powers, which were currently held by the county manager, were not &quot;governing body&quot; powers.  The elimination of the Commission's power to remove the county manager also did not change its status as &quot;governing body.&quot; Its power to remove the county manager was already limited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the findings as to the ballot summary and the notarization of the petition. It reversed the finding that the proposed amendment was unconstitutional. It remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Fla.

The landowners argued that the condemnations did not serve a public purpose, as Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 6(a) required, that their land was not blighted, and that the definition of &quot;blighted area&quot; in Fla. Stat. &sect; 163.340(8) was unconstitutionally vague. Upholding the Act's constitutionality, the court on appeal ruled that the landowners' acknowledgment that several of the factors in &sect; 163.340(8) were objective and quantifiable showed that &sect; 163.340(8) was not vague in all of its applications; the facial challenge thus had to fail. The court also ruled that the agency, in focusing on the roads, had satisfied the deteriorated structures requirement in the definition of a &quot;blighted area&quot; because &quot;structures&quot; included buildings and infrastructure, which included roads. Moreover, &sect; 163.340(8) required that two or more of the enumerated blight factors had to be shown, and the trial court found that the evidence supported five of them. The Act also was not unconstitutional as applied to the case, as more than one blight factor was proven.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a mentally retarded defendant, sought a writ of certiorari to review an order rendered by a Florida trial court denying his motion to dismiss his pending second-degree murder charge, pursuant to Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;916.303(1) (2002). This matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the instant court was whether Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;916.303(1) created a substantive right requiring dismissal of criminal charges, without prejudice, against a mentally retarded defendant who remained incompetent to proceed to trial for more than two years. Because the court held that the Florida legislature granted a defendant a substantive right to dismissal of the criminal charge after two years when it enacted &sect; 916.303(1), defendant herein was entitled to the relief he requested. Moreover, the court held that because &sect; 916.303(1) conferred a substantive right, it took precedence over Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.213(a). However, nothing in Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;916.303(1) prohibits the civil commitment of defendant to protect defendant and the public from harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writ was granted, and the matter was remanded. On remand, the trial court was to allow defendant to be involuntarily admitted to residential services under Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;393.11 (2002), or such other appropriate action as the court determined. In addition, the State was not precluded from pursuing any other appropriate action regarding defedant as authorized by law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon reviewing the inmate's claims, the court found that they either lacked merit, were not preserved for review, or should have been raised on direct appeal. First, a credibility of the witnesses claim was for the jury, not the appellate court, to consider. Second, a claim that counsel failed to make additional arguments when challenging the constitutionality of the state statutes and ordinances the inmate was found to have violated lacked merit because the inmate failed to allege the specific acts and omissions he claimed amounted to a serious deficiency in counsel's performance. Third, the inmate failed to identify which evidence was illegally seized and how it was used to obtain a search warrant. Further, he failed to allege that a motion to suppress said evidence was filed, which might have preserved the issue for review. If not preserved, appellate counsel could not raise such issues on appeal, and could not be deemed deficient for not raising them. The same was true for the inmate's personal and subject matter jurisdiction claims. Finally, the inmate's sufficiency of the evidence challenge was improperly part of his petition and a double jeopardy claim lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee hospitals filed an action against the Agency for Health Care Administration in which they argued that Fla. Stat. &sect; 408.036(3)(l) (2004) was a special law. Appellant hospital intervened. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) held in a declaratory judgment that the statute violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. Appellant challenged the decision. Appellees filed a cross-appeal arguing that the statute violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute exempted any adult open-heart surgery program meeting its criteria from a certificate-of-need requirement. It had a &quot;sunset date&quot; of January 1, 2008. Appellees argued that appellant was the only hospital that could meet the criteria. The trial court concluded that the statute was a special law passed in the guise of a general law and thus was unconstitutional because the legislature had not adhered to the notice requirements of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. The court stated that the determination of whether the statute was a special law boiled down to the issue of whether it could prospectively apply to parties other than appellant. The trial court had applied the correct legal standard by stating that the test was whether there was &quot;some potential for the statute to be applied to any other hospital.&quot; It had then heard conflicting expert testimony on whether other hospitals could reasonably qualify for the exemption before the sunset date, and its determination that no hospital besides appellant could do so was supported by competent substantial evidence, particularly the testimony of appellees' experts. The court found no merit to appellees' equal protection argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (Department), determined that a joint permit allowing renourishment of 6.9 miles of beaches and dunes within appellee city and county was properly issued, contrary to the claims of appellants, two non-profit groups (groups). The groups appealed, bringing only an as-applied constitutional challenge, and did not challenge the Department's standing or other rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The groups argued that the final order unconstitutionally applied the Beach and Shore Preservation Act. But, the appeals court found that the first group lacked standing to argue that it was adversely affected by the Department's order. Thus, its appeal was dismissed. As to the second group, it was clear that all the members therein owned property in the affected area, and thus had standing to challenge the order on appeal. Finding that the second group could bring constitutional challenges, the appeals court agreed that the second group's riparian rights to: (i) receive accretions and relictions to the property, and (ii) have the property's contact with the water remain intact, were eliminated by the Department's final order. Because their riparian rights were unconstitutionally taken without an eminent domain proceeding. as required by Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;161.141, those rights were infringed upon, requiring satisfactory evidence of sufficient upland interest pursuant to Fla. Admin. Code r. 18-21.004(3). Hence, under &sect; 161.141 (2005), if the project could not reasonably be accomplished without the taking of private property, the taking had to be made through eminent domain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment approving the permit was reversed, and the case was remanded for the Department to provide satisfactory evidence of sufficient upland interest pursuant to Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida) convicted defendant of receiving computer transmissions of descriptive or identifying information about a minor for the purpose of sexual conduct with a child, in violation of Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;847.0135(2)(d) (2000), and for showing obscene material to a minor, in violation of Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;847.0133 (2000). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that Fla.

First, despite the statute's lack of an explicitly stated mens rea element, the appeals court construed the statute as requiring knowledge by the accused that the person from whom or about whom he received the computer transmissions was a minor. Because the State charged defendant with knowledge of that fact, and the trial court required the State to prove it, no due process violation resulted. Moreover, reading a mens rea requirement into &sect;&nbsp;847.1035(2)(d) similarly required defendant to possess actual knowledge, or to believe that the person from whom he received computer transmissions of descriptive or identifying information was a minor, and that defendant did so for one purpose of facilitating sexual conduct with that minor. As a result of this holding, the court rejected defendant's First Amendment overbreadth contention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) entered a final summary judgment in favor of appellee insurer on grounds that the statute of repose for fraud claims, as described in Fla. Stat. &sect; 95.031, barred said claims filed by appellants, a husband and wife. The husband and wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife alleged that the trial court's failure to apply a delayed manifestation exception to the fraud statute of repose resulted in an unconstitutional denial of access to the courts. The appeals court disagreed. Although the Legislature, through Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;95.031(2)(a), foreclosed the now stale fraud claim, it provided the husband and wife with a reasonable alternative remedy under Fla. Stat. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;95.031(2)(c) and (d). In light of this reasonable alternative remedy, the Kluger factors were satisfied. Second, the public necessity that justified cutting off a stale fraud claim which manifested before expiration of the statute of repose was equally applicable to the instant late manifesting claim, as such was the type of claim which was most susceptible to concerns of stale memories, and most deserving of the observation that a defendant ought not to be called on to defend a claim when the evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) dismissed the second amended complaint filed by appellant medical service provider (provider) against appellee insurer seeking the balance it was owed for services it provided to the insurer's insured, pursuant to Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;627.736(5)(b)(5) (2002). The provider appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provider challenged the judgment entered. The appeals court noted that shortly after the provider filed its original complaint, the Florida Legislature amended Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;627.736(5)(b)(5) so that the annual adjustment described therein involving the Florida Consumer Price Index would occur on August 1, and be based on the annual Medical Care Item of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers in the South Region as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. Borrowing from a decision in the Third District, the appeals court adopted the holding in that case, and reasoned that the statutory amendment fit within that category of amendments that could serve as legislative interpretation of the original law rather than a substantive change thereof. In other words, the amendment clarified the original legislative intent, which was that the Consumer Price Index to be applied was the Medical Care Item of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers in the South Region. Thus, in light of this, reversal of the trial court's order was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After ruling that Fla. Const. amend. VII, codified as Fla. Const. art. X. &sect;&nbsp;25, was self-executing, and that Fla. Stat. &sect; 381.028 (2005), enacted to implement art. X, &sect; 25, was unconstitutional, a Florida trial court ruled that respondent, a personal representative, a doctor, and a clinic could access previously confidential peer review, risk management, and credentialing documents. Petitioner hospital then sought a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that: (1) Fla. Stat. &sect; 381.028 restricted rights granted under the Florida Constitution and, consequently, was unconstitutional; (2) Fla. Const. amend. VII was not unconstitutionally retrospective because there was no vested right in maintaining confidentiality of adverse medical incidents; and (3) the amendment was self-executing and prospective in operation, but retrospective as to extant records. On appeal, the court held that because &sect; 381.028 drastically limited or eliminated discovery of records the amendment expressly allowed, and limited a patients qualified to access those records, it was unconstitutional. Second, the statute provided that Fla. Const. amend. VII had no effect on existing privilege statutes, which was contrary to the stated purpose of the amendment. Further, because the hospital's expectation that previously existing statutory law would not change was not a vested, substantive right, applying the amendment to records created prior to its passage was not unconstitutionally retrospective, especially when the amendment expressed a clear intent that it be applied to include records created prior to its effective date.</SPAN></P>

Upon feeling a pipe in defendant's pocket that he believed it was a hitter pipe, the deputy reached into the pocket and seized the pipe and a package of cocaine. The appellate court found that defendant's earlier possession of the stick, which he was using as a club, provided the deputy with the necessary reasonable suspicion to conduct a weapons pat-down under the Fourth Amendment and Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother petitioned for modification of child support. In consolidated appeals, appellant father challenged orders of the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) that denied his motions to vacate an order that adopted a hearing officer's recommendation recalculating support and a final judgment awarding attorney's fees and costs to the mother. The opinion was substituted for a withdrawn previous opinion on the court's own motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the mother's modification petition, the hearing officer recommended that the father pay 81% of the child's support and tuition, found that he could provide health insurance at no cost, and set the amount of the mother's attorney's fees and costs. The trial court ratified and approved the order. On the father's first motion to vacate, the trial court denied his objections to the hearing officer's jurisdiction to consider attorney's fees and the findings on insurance and tuition but remanded the case to credit the father with another child's support. The father appealed from the trial court's order denying his second motion to vacate on the attorney's fees issue and from an order denying his third such motion, in which he argued that Fla. Fam. L.R.P. 12.491 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed both orders. Only the father's claim that the hearing officer lacked jurisdiction to consider attorney's fees because the father did not consent to the referral was properly before the court. He waived that objection by failing to raise it at the hearing. Claims related to health insurance, tuition, and guideline departures did not relate to the orders on appeal and were not considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants in driving under the influence cases sought to obtain &quot;source codes&quot; used in a breath test instrument. A county court authorized supplemental discovery concerning the codes. The State filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. The Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida) dismissed the petition on the ground that it was actually an untimely appeal. The State sought a writ of certiorari or mandamus directed to the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fla. Stat. &sect; 924.07(1)(h) authorized the State to appeal from pretrial orders. The court stated that under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4(b), the statute in the context of appeals from circuit courts to district courts had been held to be an unconstitutional legislative intrusion into the supreme court's rule-making authority. This was probably why the State had not acted under it. The circuit courts, however, obtained their appellate jurisdiction from Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(b), and only the legislature could authorize circuit court jurisdiction over nonfinal orders entered in county courts. Thus, in the context of appeals from county court to circuit court, Fla. Stat. &sect; 924.07(1)(h) was essential to give the circuit court jurisdiction, and the State should have appealed under the statute. As an appeal had to be filed within 15 days under Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(c)(3), the circuit court could not have treated the petition for certiorari as an appeal because an appeal would have been untimely. Next, the court rejected the State's argument that it could seek review either through appeal or certiorari. Certiorari was not intended to provide review when an error could be repaired on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The order granting the temporary injunction in the first appeal is REVERSED, and DCF's order denying Liberty a formal hearing in the second appeal is AFFIRMED.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Leon County Circuit Court (Florida) temporarily enjoined appellee, the Department of Children and Families (Department), from enforcing a requirement that appellant contractor post a protest bond prior to challenging the Department's construction specifications. The Department also conducted an informal hearing to resolve the dispute arising from the contractor's challenge to two specifications. Appeals from each order were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first appeal, the contractor sought to uphold the injunction issued against the Department, arguing that an amendment to Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;287.042(2)(c) (2002), removing the option of posting a $ 5,000.00 bond prior to challenging a bid specification, but continuing the 1 percent bond requirement, was unconstitutional. In the second appeal, the contractor challenged the Department's decision to conduct an informal rather than a formal hearing, to resolve the dispute arising from the contractor contesting two of the Department's specifications as arbitrary and capricious. The appeals court found no merit to either argument. Instead of posting the statutorily required bond, the contractor filed a declaratory judgment action and a motion seeking a temporary injunction, and the temporary injunction was facially deficient. As to the decision to conduct an informal hearing, the contractor's failure to cite with specificity any material facts in dispute, meant that the Department did not abuse its discretion by refusing to refer the matter to the Division of Administrative Hearings, and by proceeding informally pursuant to Fla. Stat. &sect; 120.57(2) (2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting the temporary injunction in the first appeal was reversed, while the Department's order denying the contractor a formal hearing in the second appeal was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for speeding in the Town of Redington Shores by a police officer who was employed by the Town of Indian Shores. The officer was on patrol in Redington Shores because the town had entered into an agreement by which Indian Shores was providing it with law enforcement services. Defendant argued that, absent an underlying statute, Indian Shores could not exert extra-territorial jurisdiction over Redington Shores by agreeing to have its officers provide law enforcement services for Redington Shores. The appellate court found that defendant's legal allegation was sufficient to confer standing to bring his motion to suppress. However, his challenge to the agreement was not grounded on a Fourth Amendment violation by the officer but rather was aimed at the actions of the municipal governments in allegedly failing to follow the statutory procedures applicable to the execution of interlocal agreements. No police misconduct was alleged. Thus, application of the exclusionary rule was not justified. The agreement between the two towns conferred at least de facto status on the officer who stopped defendant notwithstanding any alleged procedural infirmity in the agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who pled guilty to sexual battery on a person less than 12 years of age by a person 18 years of age or older, appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), which denied his motion to declare Fla. Stat. &sect; 775.21 (2002) unconstitutional after the State moved to declare him a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued there was a substantive due process violation because &sect; 775.21 placed an unreasonable burden on his liberty interests without affording him the opportunity to disprove his dangerousness and it established an irrebuttable presumption that certain offenders were to be designated as &quot;sexual predators&quot; without providing an opportunity to disprove dangerousness. He asserted, inter alia, that the statute would affect his liberty interests by limiting his right to move and travel. The appellate court held the relevant affected right was his right to be free from registration requirements. Defendant did not argue that the rights he was asserting were fundamental and deeply rooted in Florida's legal tradition. Thus, because no claim of infringement of a fundamental right was alleged, the reasonable basis analysis of the irrebuttable presumption was the appropriate test to apply. The statute met that test. The sexual predator designation provisions of the Florida Sexual Predator Act challenged by defendant were constitutional as there was no violation of the right to travel and the legislative determination of an irrebuttable presumption was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police followed the arrestee to his home, believing that he might have been involved in a shooting. The arrestee told the deputies that they were trespassing, and attempted to go to his house. When the deputies stopped him, the arrestee tried to hit a deputy, and the deputies forced him to the ground and pepper sprayed him. The arrestee pled no contest to resisting arrest without violence, Fla. Stat. &sect; 843.02, and adjudication of guilt was withheld. The appellate court held that under Florida law, the arrestee's no contest plea constituted a conviction even though adjudication of guilt was withheld. A judgment of conviction was conclusive evidence of probable cause, unless the judgment was obtained by fraud, perjury, or other corrupt means. Here there was no evidence or even an allegation that the guilty plea was obtained by any corrupt means. Thus, the conviction established probable cause for the arrest. Because all the claims against the deputies were related to the lawfulness of the arrest, the appellate court held that all of the claims were precluded by defendant's guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The advertiser first contended that the Commission erred in finding him guilty of violating provisions of Fla. Stat. &sect; 106.071(1) that required advertisements to display the name and address of the person who paid for the advertisements because those provisions were unconstitutional. The appeals court agreed, given the holding by the Florida Supreme Court in Doe stating that in order to comport with the First Amendment, the last sentence in &sect; 106.071(1) had to be truncated to read: Any political advertisement paid for by an independent expenditure shall prominently state &quot;Paid political advertisement.&quot; The Supreme Court did not intend to strike the identification requirement in &sect; 106.071(1) as it applied to individuals using modest resources, as such an interpretation would raise significant questions as to whom the truncated part of the statute applied. However, the Commission correctly found that the advertiser violated Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;106.143(4)(b) by failing to disclose that no candidate approved of the advertisement. Finally, the question of whether the advertiser acted willfully, as a question of fact, required an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

Both defendants appealed, and their appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants argued that the seized contraband should have been suppressed because the officer was not allowed to ask for their identification once it was established that the license tag was properly displayed. However, though a continued detention of a driver was improper once the officer fully satisfied the purpose for the initiated stop, that officer could lawfully make personal contact with the driver to explain the reason for said stop. As a result, the officer, in informing the driver his reason for the stop, had the legal authority to make personal contact with defendants and be in a position to smell the marijuana. Once the officer smelled the marijuana, he was entitled to detain both defendants. Moreover, even if the officer had immediately explained the reason for the stop when he made personal contact with defendants, rather than first asking them for their identification, he would have still smelled marijuana and thus developed probable cause to detain them. Finally, the officer was not constitutionally required to make personal contact through a closed vehicle window.</SPAN></P>

The county court had ruled in favor of the healthcare provider in its claims seeking payment pursuant to former Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured patient was covered by a policy issued by the insurer.

The healthcare provider timely billed that other insurance company, instead of the insurer, for the services. When the healthcare provider discovered the error, and billed the insurer, the insurer denied the claims as untimely. The lower courts found that allowing the healthcare provider to recover did not frustrate the legislature's purpose behind former Fla. Stat. &sect; 627.736(5)(b) (1998), was consistent with a 2001 amendment to that statute, and was equitable. In ruling on the certiorari petition, the court found that &sect; 627.736(5)(b) (1998) required claims to be billed to the insurer, and it was improper for the circuit court to apply the exception to the claims initially submitted to the wrong insurance company. The circuit court also departed from the essential requirements of law by affirming the county court's consideration of the 2001 amendment. Former Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Seminole County, Florida, convicted defendant of sexual battery while he was in a position of familial authority and while his stepdaughter was asleep, committing a first-degree felony in violation of Fla. Stat. &sect;&sect; 794.011(4)(a), (8)(b) (2003). Defendant was sentenced to two years' community control and nine years' probation. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended the reasons set forth by the trial court as the basis for defendant's downward departure sentence were not legally invalid and not supported by the evidence. The appellate court agreed, finding that the record did not support the trial court's finding that the offense was committed in an unsophisticated manner: defendant waited for the victim to fall asleep, then, in a stealth-like manner, crept into the bed alongside her and proceeded to commit sexual battery upon her. He went through several distinctive and deliberative steps in order to commit the sexual battery, including walking upstairs, opening and closing his stepdaughter's door, getting on the bed with her, and moving his hands under the bedcovers. These steps were further evidence that this crime was not committed in an unsophisticated manner. Defendant's alleged inebriation during the incident did not justify the downward departure sentence as such a reason contravened the language of Fla. Stat. &sect; 921.0026(3), which forbid the use of intoxication to justify a downward departure. Nor did the law support downward departure merely for committing an offense less heinously than other defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and designation as a sexual predator were affirmed; defendant's sentence was reversed and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a final order entered by the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), which reimposed his sentence based upon his 1991 convictions for two counts of armed kidnapping, two counts of robbery with a firearm, and one count of armed burglary. Those crimes were committed in 1988.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his habitual violent felony offender sentence, claimed he was erroneously denied jail credit for time he spent in prison out of state, and argued that a scoresheet error was made based on the inclusion of points for convictions for crimes committed after the offenses at issue. On direct appeal, defendant had raised the issue of the legality of his habitual violent felony offender sentence, and the court affirmed; thus, the law of the case applied. While defendant asserted that he was entitled to credit for time spent in custody in Pennsylvania after he was first sentenced for the offenses at issue, the court held that the term &quot;county jail&quot; as used in Fla. Stat. &sect; 921.161(1) (1987) only referred to Florida jails and was not applicable to obtain credit while a defendant was incarcerated in another state on unrelated charges. However, the court agreed that a scoresheet error occurred as the plain language of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.701(d)(5) indicated that a sentencing court could not score as a prior conviction an offense which was committed after the primary offense; thus, the use of defendant's 1990 convictions for offenses committed in Pennsylvania was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed as to the legality of defendant's habitual violent felony offender sentence and the denial of sentencing credit. The court reversed defendant's sentence on counts I and II based on the scoresheet error and remanded with directions to impose a sentence based upon a corrected scoresheet without points from convictions for offenses occurring after the offenses at issue in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chairperson filed a petition seeking the commissioner's recall from office. The city clerk delivered the petition to the commissioner. The petition alleged that the commissioner violated provisions of Florida's Sunshine Law by engaging in an unauthorized meeting with other city commissioners regarding the closing of a local trailer park, thereby committing malfeasance in office. The commissioner brought an action against defendants, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The commissioner alleged that the recall petition failed to set forth facts that, if true, would demonstrate malfeasance in office. The trial court entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court found that compliance with Florida's Sunshine Law was required by all elected officials. Thus, the commissioner's failure to so comply would be unlawful. As such, the trial court properly concluded that the petition adequately alleged a claim of malfeasance.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that insertion of &quot;and/or&quot; between his name and the name of the codefendant in the jury instructions allowed the jury to wrongfully convict him for the criminal conduct of codefendant. The appellate court held that because the codefendant was acquitted, the fundamental instructional error rule did not apply. Defendant never obtained a ruling from the trial court regarding his motion in limine. Therefore, the evidentiary issue was not preserved under Fla. Stat. &sect; 90.104(1) (2003). Accordingly, his failure to do so, along with his failure to timely object at the time the testimony concerning his drug sales was introduced, effectively waived his objection and the appellate court could not review any claimed error resulting from admission of that testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an inmate, appealed a decision from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), which denied his motion for postconviction relief (PCR) pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The inmate had been convicted of felony DUI, driving while his license was permanently revoked, and carrying a concealed weapon by a convicted felon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was charged with, inter alia, driving while his license was permanently revoked, in violation of Fla. Stat. &sect; 322.341 (2001). He entered an open plea of guilt and he was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment. Thereafter, the inmate filed his motion for PCR, which was denied by the trial court. On appeal, the court held that the inmate's convictions and sentences on those charges should have been vacated because &sect; 322.341 was unconstitutional at the time of the alleged offenses. As the inmate was convicted of a nonexistent crime due to violation of the single subject rule of 1998 Fla. Laws 223, within which Fla. Stat. &sect; 322.341 was created, he was entitled to vacatur of those convictions and sentences. The issue of whether the inmate's counsel was ineffective in pursuing a trial strategy of not raising a Critchfield argument was irrelevant because the inmate was entitled to relief. However, as the inmate entered an &quot;open plea&quot; and had no agreement with the State, there was no basis to set aside the plea in its entirety. The other charges and convictions were valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court with respect to denial of the inmate's PCR motion as to all charges except the driving with a revoked license convictions.

In the absence of a constitutionally valid basis for an order concerning grandparent visitation, the trial court's orders appointing the parental coordinator and requiring the father to meet and consult with the coordinator concerning visitation subjected him to an unwarranted inquiry into his private decision-making process concerning the best interests of his children. Furthermore, the trial court made no finding that the children would suffer harm as a result of the absence of grandparent visitation and no evidence was presented to support such a finding. The appellate court concluded that the trial court's orders designed to facilitate grandparent visitation over the father's objection manifestly violated his fundamental right as a parent to raise his children.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the use of the term &quot;funding&quot; within the language of Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 14 was ambiguous with regard to the cities' exemption or exclusion from the payment of filing fees, and the trial court erred in not considering extrinsic evidence regarding legislative history and background of the constitutional amendment to aid in interpretation. Based on the trial court's pronouncement at the hearing that there was no ambiguity and that extrinsic evidence would not be considered, the cities did not present extrinsic evidence concerning intent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) that found him to be an indigent appellant and therefore, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 57.085, imposed a lien on his inmate trust account to cover the costs of filing an appeal from an underlying order upholding the constitutionality of a method by which respondent corrections department calculated his gain time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's underlying petition challenged the manner in which his gain time was calculated. He claimed that the calculation had deprived him of five years of potential freedom. When he appealed the denial of his petition, the trial court imposed a lien on his inmate account to cover the fees for filing his appeal. The court held that under a rule announced by the state supreme court in its Schmidt decision, a petition that involved the length of an inmate's incarceration was a collateral criminal proceeding within the meaning of Fla. Stat. ch. 57.081, and in such a proceeding, a lien could not be imposed on an inmate's trust account. Since such an application of Schmidt could potentially affect many inmate proceedings, the court certified a question to the supreme court, inquiring as to whether it had actually intended Schmidt to apply this broadly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the inmate's motion for review, and reversed the order that imposed the lien. The court certified a question of great public importance to the state's highest court, asking whether this result was what that court had intended.</SPAN></P>

The first domestic partner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first domestic partner and the second domestic partner began to live together. Thereafter, they jointly entered into a sperm donation agreement with the sperm donor. As a result, the second domestic partner became pregnant. After the birth of the child, they entered into another agreement known as a &quot;co-parenting agreement.&quot; Pursuant to an amended sperm donation agreement, the second domestic partner became pregnant with a second child. The parties then executed a &quot;co-parenting agreement&quot; regarding the second child. A few years later, the parties ceased residing together. The first domestic partner sought what was essentially a declaration of parental rights to the two children born to the second domestic partner, based on the agreements. The trial court granted the second domestic partner's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the appellate court found that under Florida law and absent evidence of detriment to a child, courts did not have any authority to grant custody or compel visitation by a person who was not a natural parent and that agreements providing for visitation by a non-parent, such as the first domestic partner, were unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

The resident sought damages and injunctive relief, based on her claim that a bridge toll was an unconstitutional tax and was unreasonable, and that the disrepair of the bridge resulted in increased garbage fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The basis for the complaint was that the county had failed to adequately maintain the bridge despite receiving ample bridge toll revenue for that purpose. The trial court dismissed the action, finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, that the resident lacked standing, and that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had limited subject matter jurisdiction over the action pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 20(i) and Fla. Stat. ch. 26.012(2)(e) (2004). Further, as a county resident who alleged a special injury, there was standing to assert the claims regarding reasonableness of the toll, but no standing to challenge the underlying political decisions. The complaint was disorganized and deficient, but it was not incapable of amendment to state a valid claim. The resident had no entitlement to an order requiring the county to improve the maintenance to the bridge, to claim damages from a garbage surcharge, or to seek refunds for previously paid tolls. However, she could attempt to obtain a prospective injunction as to future tolls. The court determined that the toll was a user fee, rather than a tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of dismissal of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings, including an opportunity to amend the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), granted an injunction against appellant developer finding that, pursuant to a planned unit development (PUD) with the developer's predecessor in title, it was obligated to restore, enhance, and preserve an area known as the Big Blue Reserve. Thus, it rejected the developer's taking claims. The developer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the developer's challenge, the court first rejected its claim that it was entitled to compensation under the Bert J. Harris Act, Fla. Stat. &sect; 70.001, as there was no reasonable, investment-backed expectation for an existing use of the Big Blue reserve. From 1972 forward, it was designated as a natural reserve and extraordinary efforts were made to preserve this important pristine forest. At the time the developer purchased the surrounding property, Big Blue was designated as a nature reserve, and the town's redesignation of it as a &quot;conservation area&quot; in its comprehensive plan changed nothing regarding the property. Second, the PUD was not unconstitutionally applied to the Big Blue property, was not overly broad and vague, and defined critical and technical terms used therein. Further, the trial court was correct in deferring to the agency's interpretation of its zoning code. Finally, the court rejected the developer's takings claim, although the Big Blue property would be flooded and thus unusable for development, as that was precisely the condition of the property that the developer's predecessors agreed to in exchange for developing other property with higher densities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant medical center, which had previously been the only hospital with an open heart surgery program in a county, sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which found Fla. Stat. &sect; 408.039a was constitutional and thus, had the effect of granting appellee hospital a license to also perform open heart surgery. The medical center argued a grandfather clause violated procedural due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital's application for a certificate of need (CON) to establish an open heart surgery program in the same service district as the medical center was approved. The Florida Legislature amended Fla. Stat. &sect;&sect; 408.036 and 408.0361 to create a new licensure scheme for adult interventional cardiology services with 2004 Fla. Laws ch. 383, &sect;&sect; 6, 7 at 2922-36. The legislature added a licensure grandfather clause applicable to the hospital's application. The appellate court held that appellee Agency for Health Care Administration's interpretation was not clearly erroneous and did not conflict with the intent of Fla. Stat. &sect; 408.0361(3)(a), as amended, was entitled to great deference. Accordingly, adult interventional cardiology services included open heart surgery. There was no due process violation because the medical center had no constitutionally protected property right in pursuing its non-final administrative hearing challenge to the hospital's CON application after the enactment of the grandfather amendment. The medical center had only a mere expectation of a continuing right under the statute. There was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

Two defendants solicited children primarily from public housing areas and transported them to and from the clinic. The dentists billed Medicaid and split the fees. The trial court held that Fla. Stat. &sect; 409.920(2)(a), as written at the time, was preempted by federal law. The appellate court agreed that Congress mandated a knowing and willful standard for Medicaid fraud violations. Thus, the prior definition of &quot;knowingly&quot; in &sect; 409.920(1)(d) rendered it unconstitutional and those counts were properly dismissed. However, Fla. Stat. &sect; 817.505 did not pose the same constitutional concerns as it was not vague and clearly prohibited fees based on the referral of patients. Thus, the trial court erred in declaring it unconstitutional. The multiple charges of patient brokering filed against defendants exceeded the allowable unit of prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed as to the patient brokering charge. It was affirmed as to the remainder of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), entered two non-final orders, the first of which denied appellant father's exceptions to the general master's report upholding the trial court's 1998 order granting appellee maternal grandmother visitation rights with her minor grandchild. The second order held the father in contempt. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father challenged the judgments entered on constitutional grounds based on his right to privacy, which he contended that he did not waive by signing an agreement allowing the grandmother visitation. At issue was the question of whether a parent's agreement to visitation by a grandparent with the parent's minor child waived the parent's right to later enforce his constitutional privacy right to raise his child free from government intrusion and thus, prevented him from later revoking his agreement for visitation. The court answered this question in the negative. Second, the court declared Fla. Stat. ch. 752.07&nbsp;unconstitutional. Thus, in the absence of a constitutional statute upon which the court could base its order, it could not order such visitation in favor of a non-parent. Moreover, because the court's granting of visitation rights to a non-parent over the parent's objection was an unenforceable order, the finding that the grandmother was an interested party was erroneous. Thus, the grandmother had no right to notice of the adoption proceedings. For that reason, the order of contempt could not stand and was ordered vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for the orders therein to be vacated.</SPAN></P>

The company sought to have a confidentiality order entered. The trial court, without a hearing, entered the company's requested confidentiality order. The case was then tried. The injured person and his spouse obtained a verdict in their favor. The trial court, however, granted a new trial. The appellate court reinstated the jury's verdict and directed that the pretrial confidentiality order be vacated pursuant to the Sunshine in Litigation Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 69.081 (Act). On remand, the company sought a hearing and an in-camera inspection of the documents covered by the confidentiality order. Alternatively, the company claimed the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the requested relief. On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court erred in issuing the confidentiality order but that the company was not entitled to relief because it invited the error and the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant served prison time for a sex crime and was scheduled for release. Before the release date, the State petitioned to civilly commit him. A jury trial revealed his lengthy history of sex crimes. One of the crimes involved defendant's sexual assault of the nine-year-old daughter of a woman. At defendant's civil commitment hearing, the State introduced evidence of the mother's account about what the daughter had told her about the assault. Defendant called the daughter as a witness; she testified that she could not remember what happened. In rebuttal, the State called a clinical psychologist who testified about why the daughter might not remember such an event. The jury determined that defendant was a sexually-violent predator and the trial court ordered him committed as such. On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court did not err in admitting victim hearsay statements to establish the factual basis for his underlying sex crimes because the hearsay exception under the Jimmy Ryce Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 394.910 et seq. (Act), the trial court did not err in finding the Act to be constitutional, and the clinical psychologist's testimony was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that, since the lewd activity at issue occurred in a public place, it was not required to prove that someone was offended by the suspects' conduct in order to establish a prima facie case. The instant court agreed. If the courts required the State to prove that a party other than a law enforcement officer was offended by a defendant's lewd and lascivious conduct when said conduct occurred in a public place, such a ruling would lead to absurd results. Even if the instant court were to have concluded that an element of offensiveness was contained in the statutes at issue, dismissal of the State's charges was unwarranted because, in order for the offensiveness element to be constitutionally valid, an objective reasonable person standard, not a subjective standard, had to be used. The application of a subjective standard would allow an overly sensitive member of the public, or a member of the police force, to object to conduct which was not objectively offensive, thereby exposing a criminal defendant to arbitrary and capricious prosecution. Similarly, potentially criminal conduct could go unpunished if the observer of the conduct was particularly insensitive to it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Lee County (Florida) held that it lacked the power to order appellees, the non-parental guardians of the person of a minor ward (maternal grandparents), to permit visitation between the ward and appellant, his paternal grandmother. It also denied motion filed by appellant, the guardian or the property (guardian), for the appointment of a guardian ad litem. The paternal grandmother and the guardian appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented was whether the probate court had the power to order the non-parental guardians of the person of a minor ward to permit visitation between the ward and his paternal grandmother. The appeals court held that it did. The paternal grandmother was not asking the probate court to order the parents to permit her to visit the ward, she was asking the court to compel the maternal grandparents to permit such visitation, who obviously were not the ward's parents. Moreover, the focus of the probate court's analysis should have been on whether such visitation was in the ward's best interests instead of the respective rights of the parties to demand or to withhold visitation. Second, because the probate court incorrectly ruled that it had no power to interfere with the decision of the guardians of the person to deny the paternal grandmother any visitation with the ward, the probate court failed to consider her visitation petition based on the ward's best interests. The court also held that the probate court properly refused to appoint a guardian ad litem, as the petition for appointment was not timely presented.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying an appointment of a guardian ad litem was affirmed. But, the order prohibiting visitation between the paternal grandmother and the ward was reversed, and the case was remanded on this issue. If it decides to grant the paternal mother visitation, it should do so considering the ward's best interest. If visitation was denied, the paternal grandmother was to be allowed to petition again for visitation if circumstances changed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), found that appellee village did not engage in an unlawful &quot;as applied&quot; taking in requiring appellant developer to restore, enhance, and preserve an area known as Big Blue Reserve in connection with the 1972 Wellington Planned Unit Development (PUD). The developer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court properly ordered the developer to comply with the PUD Master Plan's restrictions by preserving the Big Blue Reserve (Big Blue) and protecting it from alteration and development activities, to enhance it by removing exotic vegetation, and to preserve and enhance it by increasing the property's water levels by one foot above existing levels. As a result, the developer's claim that a violation of the Bert J. Harris Act (Act) occurred, was frivolous, as it was fairly obvious from the abundant history of Big Blue that there was no reasonable, investment-backed expectation for an existing use of the area at all. Since 1972, it was designated as a natural reserve and extraordinary efforts were made to preserve this important pristine forest. At the time the developer purchased the property it sought to develop, Big Blue was designated as a nature reserve, and its redesignation as a conservation area changed nothing. Second, the PUD master plan was not void for vagueness or overbreadth, as the developer's predecessors-in-title, as well as the regulating agencies, gave specific meanings to the terms used therein, and said meanings were well understood by the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order entered against the media prevented all members of the public from viewing the exhibits at issue. The instant court concluded that the statutes relied upon by the trial court to bar examination of this evidence by the media did not apply to the exhibits at issue, which had been formally introduced into evidence. Instead, the trial court was required to apply the analysis set forth in Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.051(c). Under that analysis, the court held that the four members of the media who asked to view the evidence were improperly excluded from viewing it. But, because the media was not seeking to copy or publish that evidence, they were not entitled to do so. Further, the trial court was not required to make this evidence generally available for easy viewing by large numbers of people. Finally, because the photographic evidence had already been viewed by various people in law enforcement, court personnel and lawyers, the criminal trial jury, and presumably by the grand jury, less restrictive measures existed to protect the victim's family while also protecting the competing interests engendered by a public trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentences were based on a 1994 scoresheet. He argued that his scoresheet was incorrectly calculated at both his original sentencing and at the sentencing on the violation of probation. He claimed that his sexual battery convictions were scored as level 9 offenses when they were actually level 7 offenses. The appellate court held that the sexual battery offense in Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(8)(b) was required to be scored as a level 7 offense. For all relevant times Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0012 required that defendant's sexual battery offenses be scored as level 7 offenses. It was clear that defendant's scoresheet contained a sizable error. Since, however, it was not clear whether defendant's sentence was the result of a plea agreement or the result of an open plea, it was necessary for the trial court to determine what, if any, relief was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida) entered a final order dismissing appellant minor's petition for a judicial waiver of the statutory requirement that her physician notify her parent or guardian prior to terminating her pregnancy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor challenged the judgment entered. The appeals court first held that the factual findings by the trial judge were insufficient as no evidence supported a conclusion that the minor was not sufficiently mature to decide to terminate her pregnancy or that she failed to prove that notifying her parents of her decision would not be in her best interest. The fact that the minor lived with her parents, learned of her pregnancy through a home pregnancy test, and feared that divulging this decision would damage her relationships with her parents, standing alone, bore no logical relationship to the statutory grounds for a judicial bypass of the parental notification requirement. However, the instant court decided against remand because (1) remand for the purpose of supplying appropriate findings of fact would violate the legislative intention that judicial bypass petitions progress through the justice system without delay; and (2) the record before the circuit court was not likely to yield findings sufficient to deny the waiver petition. Moreover, under the criteria outlined by the Texas Supreme Court, notifying the minor's parents of her decision was not in her best interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Osceola County (Florida) declared a local shopping cart retention ordinance unconstitutional because it purportedly conflicted with Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Many businesses installed retention systems in compliance with the ordinance. The appellees, members of the Florida Retail Federation (Federation), however, refused to install a retention system, electing instead to submit an alternative plan to retrieve their own carts. Because these plans represented a reactive approach rather than a preventative plan, the city rejected these proposals and demanded compliance with the ordinance. The Federation sued the city for declaratory and injunctive relief, Both sides moved for summary judgment. The trial court denied the city's motion, granted the Federation's. The appellate court agreed with the city that the ordinance was constitutional. A municipality could, under its broad home rule powers, enact local ordinances that were not inconsistent with general law pursuant to Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2(b). The court rejected the contention that when the legislature prohibited the assessment of any fee, fine or cost against a retailer whose cart had been retrieved from public property, it effectively immunized retailers from all efforts by local government to encourage owners to keep carts under control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Martin County (Florida), that convicted him of armed escape from a civil commitment facility pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 394.927(1); defendant claimed, inter alia, that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the single subject rule in Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was being held as a pretrial civil detainee pending a jury determination of whether he qualified for commitment for involuntary commitment as a sexually violent predator. Prior to his trial, defendant attempted to escape from the facility. The appellate court found that the object and purpose of 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 222 was to protect the public from sexually violent predators. Making it a crime for sexually violent predators to escape from their commitment promoted the purpose of the legislation through the additional measure to protect the public. Therefore, Fla. Stat. ch. 394.927(1) was constitutional under the single subject provision of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. Because defendant's allegation that the prosecutor breached a promise to recommend a lesser sentence was conclusively refuted by the plea agreement and colloquy, the trial court did not err in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion. Finally, since the trial court's order on the State's motion in limine was not dispositive of the case, and it was not designated as a motion being reserved for appeal, the issue was not preserved under Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(b)(2)(A)(i).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion, challenging an earlier plea as involuntary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into a plea to resolve a felony DUI charge. As part of his plea, he agreed to a lifetime revocation of his driver's license. In the motion under review, defendant alleged that he did so because counsel advised him that he could apply for a work permit license after five years. This was a correct statement of law at the time. Later, the legislature changed the law to eliminate the opportunity to apply for a work permit license for individuals with lifetime suspensions. Defendant was precluded from reinstatement. The appellate court held that a trial court was required to inform a defendant only of the direct consequences of the plea but was under no duty to advise the defendant of any collateral consequences. The possibility of a reinstatement of driving privileges was not a direct consequence of a plea. The trial court informed defendant that his license was revoked for life and, thus, informed him of the direct consequence of his plea.  Nothing in the plea hearings or plea agreement even mentioned reinstatement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, property owners, sued defendants, neighbors, a trailer park, and others, seeking a declaratory judgment concerning the borders of the owners' property. The owners dismissed the action as against the neighbors after the action was sent to mediation. The Circuit Court for Lee County (Florida) awarded attorney's fees to the neighbors pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 57.105(1) (2003). The owners appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners purchased a mobile home in a mobile home park. The owners sought to build a fence around their property, and the neighbors claimed that the proposed fence would impose on their property. Fla. Stat. ch. 57.105(1) (2003) authorized an award of attorney's fees when plaintiffs or their counsel knew or should have known that their claim against a defendant was not supported by material facts, or would not be supported by the application of then existing law to those material facts. The property interests in this case were complex. The only means of determining where one's leased property began and another ended was by reference to sketches and drawings. The court held that it was possible that jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act would exist against the neighbors. Certainly, if this suit were to proceed without the neighbors, who initially complained about the fence, and if the court decided that the fence should be placed in a position that the neighbors would deem adverse to them, then their omission as parties would be glaring. Thus, the voluntary dismissal did not constitute adequate justification for Fla. Stat ch. 57.105 (2003) fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three police officers observed defendant engaging in hand to hand transactions with passengers in cars. The officers then stopped in front of the house where that activity was occurring. Defendant ran to the rear of the property, but other officers were located there, and when they identified themselves, defendant tried to run but was arrested. The officers then found cocaine rocks in sufficient quantity to support the charge of possession with intent to sell. At defendant's trial, the State commented in closing argument that if defendant was innocent, he would have stood his ground and told the officers why he was innocent. Defendant objected and moved for a mistrial, but the trial court overruled the objection and denied the mistrial motion. On appeal, the appellate court found a new trial was required because the State's comment violated defendant's constitutional right to remain silent following his arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court held that in order to terminate the claimant's supplemental benefits, the E/C had the burden of showing, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(1)(e), that the claimant would be eligible for both social security retirement benefits and social security disability benefits. Because the E/C failed in this burden, it was ordered to reinstate the claimant's supplemental benefits. On appeal, the E/C argued that (1) the claimant's entitlement to supplemental benefits automatically ceased when she turned age 62 because she became permanently and totally disabled prior to reaching age 62; and (2) even if the claimant's entitlement did not automatically cease at age 62, she was no longer entitled to supplemental benefits because she was eligible for social security disability benefits. The appeals court held that the claimant was eligible for social security disability benefits if she was insured for disability insurance benefits, was younger than age 65, and was under a disability. Thus, as the JCC found, the E/C failed to show that the claimant was eligible for social security disability benefits and declined a continuance so that the issue could be addressed in more detail.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney appealed the final order from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which granted defendant state officials' motion to dismiss his complaint seeking a declaration that the statute governing the statewide registry of private attorneys available for court appointment to represent death row inmates in postconviction proceedings (Registry Act) violated Fla. Const. art. V, art. II, &sect; 3, and art. I, &sect;&sect; 16, 9, 2, 13, and 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For six years, the attorney represented a death row inmate on a pro bono basis in capital postconviction proceedings. He filed suit alleging that he believed he had a right under the Florida constitution to seek compensation in excess of the capped fee schedule set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 27.7002 of the Registry Act. The trial court dismissed the complaint, finding that the fee challenge was dealt with in the attorney's prior case (Olive I) and that the attorney's constitutional claim did not present a justiciable controversy because there was no state constitutional right to counsel in capital postconviction relief proceedings. On appeal, the court disagreed with the trial court that the constitutional challenges to the Registry Act were decided in Olive I and found that Olive I addressed only the constitutionality of the capped fee schedule in the Registry Act. The court then found that there was enough confusion in the Florida law to raise a question as to the existence of a right to counsel in capital postconviction relief proceedings under the Florida constitution; therefore the trial court erred in finding that the case did not present a justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The hospital appealed and appellee mother cross-appealed as to the issues of compensability and notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court disagreed with the ALJ's conclusion that the mother was entitled to notice under the NICA, as notice to a patient when the patient had an emergency medical condition, or when notice was not practicable, was not required under Fla. Stat. ch. 766.316. The ALJ misapplied the law by interpreting the statute to require both: (1) a finding of an emergency medical condition, and (2) a finding that the provision of notice was not practicable. The statute contained two distinct exceptions, each of which independently provided an exception to the pre-delivery notice requirement. As to the mother's cross-appeal, insufficient evidence was presented to conclude that the mother was not in labor following the abruption and prior to delivery, or that the oxygen deprivation the child suffered during the course of delivery and resuscitation did not contribute significantly to his brain injury. Finally, the terms &quot;labor,&quot; &quot;substantial impairment,&quot; and &quot;permanent injury,&quot; were certain enough that a reasonable and practical construction could be given to the language by reference to other definable sources, such as the medical literature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ALJ's ruling that the hospital was not exempted from providing pre-delivery notice was error, and that portion of the order was reversed. In all other respects, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) declared Fla. Stat. ch. 550.615(6) was unconstitutional and determined that the statute was a special law, invalid on the ground that it was not enacted according to the applicable procedures in Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10, in favor of the request of appellee racing association. Appellant Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fla. Stat ch. 550.615(6) prohibited the holder of a thoroughbred horse racing permit from engaging in inter-track wagering in an area of Florida where there were at least three horse racing permit holders within 25 miles of each other, but the conditions that triggered the prohibition of ch. 550.615(6) against inter-track wagering applied only in one small geographic area straddling the border between Dade County and Broward County. On appeal, and after a review of the evidence in the record, there was no reasonable possibility that those conditions would ever exist in any other part of the state. Moreover, the decision to exclude a limited class of thoroughbred permit holders from the privilege of engaging in inter-track wagering was an arbitrary decision that did not promote any valid public policy. For these reasons, the appeals court agreed with the circuit court that ch. 550.615(6) was a special law enacted in the guise of a general law, and thus invalid. Finally, the class created by ch. 550.615(6) was closed. The statute applied only in a limited part of Florida, and therefore, it should have been enacted under the procedures that applied to special laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (Department) sought certiorari review as to the question of whether using non-lawyers as hearing officers in formal hearings under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.2615(6) violated the due process rights of motorists arrested for driving under the influence. In four other cases, respondent motorists sought review. After the cases at issue were consolidated, the instant matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that if the Florida Constitution allowed for non-lawyers to sit on the county court bench, it surely allowed for non-lawyers to sit as hearing officers in driver's license suspension hearings. Further, if there was no due process violation for the use of non-lawyers as county court judges, there could be no similar violation in the use of these same non-lawyers as hearing officers pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322. Thus, as to three of the cases on review, the circuit court afforded the motorists due process and applied the correct law. As to the last case, the hearing officer acted as an advocate for the Department when she stopped the hearing and located a missing document, and quashed the hearing officer's order of suspension, set aside and vacated the suspension of that motorists' license, and directed the Department to expunge the suspension from his driving record. Thus, she departed from her neutral role as magistrate. Further, the finding as to the hearing officer's abandonment of neutrality meant that the decision to quash the suspension order and to reinstate driving privileges remained, and rendered moot the other errors asserted by the Department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question was answered in the negative, the Department's petition was granted in the first case, but the motorists' petitions for review in the related, consolidated cases were denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The OPOs failed to pay their taxes, and the tax collector issued a tax certificate for the property. The OPOs notified the tax collector and the court clerk that they had moved and they supplied him with their new address. However, the address information was not updated. The OPOs did not receive notice of the application for a tax deed or the date of the proposed sale. The property was sold at the tax deed sale, and that purchaser deeded the land by quit claim deed to the SPOs. The SPOs brought their quiet title action, and the OPOs claimed that they did not receive notice of the tax sale. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the SPOs, finding that the notice was sufficient under Fla. Stat. ch. 197.522(1)(a) and 197.502(4)(a) (2000). On appeal, the court found that the clerk's notice of the tax deed sale to the OPOs' old address was not &quot;reasonably calculated under all of the circumstances&quot; to apprise them of the sale. Accordingly, their constitutional due process rights were violated. To the extent other case law conflicted, it was noted and a conflict was certified on that issue.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 794.011(3), 810.02(2)(a), which were entered pursuant to his no contest pleas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to criminal charges. He was convicted and sentenced. On appeal, defendant raised three issues: (1) the trial court erred by denying his motion to withdraw his pleas based on defense counsel's failure to advise him that the burglary charge was barred by the statute of limitations, (2) his conviction for burglary had to be vacated because it was barred by the statute of limitations, and (3) the condition of probation requiring him to submit biological specimens for DNA testing was unconstitutional. The court found that defendant failed to preserve his issue regarding the statute of limitations. Also, his counsel's alleged ineffectiveness regarding that issue had to be presented in a motion for post-conviction relief because there were factual issues to be resolved through an evidentiary hearing. Based on a prior conclusive decision, the court rejected the argument that the DNA testing requirement under Fla. Stat, ch. 943.325 violated his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Finally, the court concluded that defendant's other constitutional challenges to DNA testing as a probation condition were not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentences without prejudice to his right to seek post-conviction relief on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), which convicted him of one count of armed robbery and one count of aggravated fleeing or eluding (AFE) in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1935(4) (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant participated in the robbery of a convenience store by serving as the get-away driver. While driving away from police pursuit, he caused an accident. Instead of stopping, he continued his flight. He was convicted for AFE in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1935(4) (2002) as well as armed robbery. On appeal, he argued that he was wrongfully convicted of AFE because the State could not prove essential elements of the offense. He also brought other challenges, but the court rejected them without discussion. The court found that it was undisputed that officers began their pursuit because defendant had participated in robbing a convenience store, not because he left the scene of an accident involving injury, death, or property damage. Therefore, the first element of ch. 316.1935(4) was absent from the evidence. Also absent was the third element of further property damage or injury after striking the car and continuing flight. Consequently, the AFE conviction was not supported by the evidence. However, defendant did commit the lesser included offense of misdemeanor fleeing or eluding in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1935(1) (2002) and could be sentenced for that crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and sentence for AFE, and the court remanded for the entry judgment and a sentence for the lesser included offense of misdemeanor fleeing or eluding. Otherwise, the judgment and sentence was affirmed without discussion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles sought certiorari review of the order of the Circuit Court for the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit for Hillsborough County (Florida), which granted a writ of certiorari and quashed the Department's order revoking respondent driver's operator's license. The Department argued that the trial court failed to apply the correct law in determining that the offense was not a qualifying offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Acting under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.27(5) (2002), the Department revoked the driver's operator's license for five years as a habitual traffic offender. The Department based its determination on one offense of driving under the influence and two offenses of driving while his license was suspended (DWLS). The trial court ruled that one of the offenses on which the Department relied was not a qualifying offense under the pertinent statutory provisions since it was based on a nolo contendere plea with adjudication withheld and thus could not be considered a conviction for purposes of determining the driver to be a habitual traffic offender. The appellate court held that the trial court failed to apply the correct law in issuing a ruling that was at odds with the clearly established law articulated in Raulerson. The driver's second DWLS offense was not an offense for which adjudication was withheld under Fla. Stat. ch. 318.14(10). The disposition sheet established that the driver's second DWLS offense was a knowing offense subject to a criminal penalty pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(2) and therefore not subject to disposition as a noncriminal traffic infraction under Fla. Stat. ch. 318.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters sought to prevent the destruction of unused punch card ballots from the 2000 presidential election, claiming that they were public records under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 24 and Fla. Stat. ch. 119.01 (2003). The voters also contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 101.545 (2003), which governed the retention and destruction of certain election materials, violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 24. The trial court ruled that the unused ballots were not public records and that Fla. Stat. ch. 101.545 (2003) did not violate any portion of the state constitution. The court agreed. The unused ballots did not fit into Florida's concept of public records because the did not perpetuate, communicate, or formalize knowledge. The ballots did not become public records until they were actually voted. Because the ballots were not public records, ch. 101.545's grant of discretion to the Secretary of State and election supervisors concerning retention or destruction of the ballots did not violate the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The determinative issue in the instant appeal was whether the foundation was a federal instrumentality for state tax immunity purposes. The appeals court held that it was not. The foundation was a charitable corporation under the laws of Florida created solely for the purpose of fostering and perpetuating the U.S. Naval Museum, unfettered by government control. Further, the foundation was not operated by federal employees and, although federal law and U.S. Navy regulations governed the Navy's acceptance of the foundation's gifts to it and impacted the finances and budget of the foundation, the federal government did not regulate, supervise or appoint members of the governing board of the foundation. By this arrangement, the U.S. Navy and the foundation were independent legal entities. Third, the foundation did not fulfill an essential function of government, despite the fact that it raised significant financial support for the naval museum. Hence, due to the aforementioned, the court declined to address the Department's alternative argument that even if the foundation were a federal instrumentality, it would not be immune from the obligation to collect state sales taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) convicted defendant of possession of a controlled substance and trafficking an illegal drug and sentenced him to five years in prison for the former and to a concurrent 15-year minimum mandatory sentence for the trafficking conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment entered against him, first contending that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting certain photographs as impeachment evidence during the State's rebuttal as the trial court had excluded the photographs earlier as a remedy for the State's Richardson violation. The appeals court disagreed, holding that any error was harmless, without explanation. Second, with the State's concession, defendant's convictions and sentences for both possession and trafficking in the same heroin violated double jeopardy. Accordingly, the conviction and sentence for simple possession could not stand and had to be dismissed on remand. Finally, the sentence for the trafficking count did not unconstitutionally violate Fla. Stat. ch. 835.135, as amended by 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188, the single-subject rule, as the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the instant court's decision that there was no constitutional impairment to this statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Florida Department of Financial Services (Department), affirmed two stop-work and penalty-assessment orders issued against appellant employer for failing to provide workers' compensation coverage to eight employees at two job sites. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer claimed on appeal that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.107 (2001) violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, because it did not provide for notice or an opportunity to be heard before or immediately upon issuance of a stop-work order, and instead only permitted an employer to contest an order under Fla. Stat. ch. 120, which did not provide expedited review. The appeals court disagreed. The employer was advised that she had the right to request an expedited, summary hearing pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 120.574 (2001). But, she instead sought relief under Fla. Stat. ch. 120.57(1) (2001), and never informed the judge or the Department that she was being harmed by the less expeditious proceeding. Thus, she failed to show that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.107 was unconstitutional by denying due process to an employer found to be in violation of Fla. Stat ch. 440. Finally, the employer failed to provide any argument that showed why $ 2,200 in penalties, as authorized by Fla. Stat. ch. 440.107, was disproportionate to her conduct in allowing eight employees to engage in new-home construction without workers' compensation coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was asked to leave a department store by store employees. At the same time, a police officer, who happened to be in the store investigating an unrelated incident, advised defendant that he was to be issued a trespass warning. The officer instructed defendant to come with him to his patrol car, where the trespass warning forms were kept. At the patrol car, the officer patted down defendant and discovered a gun. At the suppression hearing, the officer's testimony showed that he conducted the pat-down search not out of any particularized concern for his safety, but as a matter of routine. The officer also testified that, prior to the pat-down, he had no intention of arresting defendant. The appellate court held that an officer needed to have probable cause to believe a suspect was armed before the officer was allowed to conduct a pat down search or frisk of the suspect to ascertain the presence of a weapon. Pat-down searches performed routinely or for safety purposes only were constitutionally impermissible.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that (1) the manslaughter instruction, which allowed a jury to convict if defendant's actions caused &quot;or contributed&quot; to the victims' deaths was proper because &quot;cause&quot; as used in Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(3)(c)3 encompassed a cause that &quot;contributed&quot; to an injury that resulted in death; (2) defendant's motion to suppress blood-alcohol test results because he was denied the chance to speak to his attorney/father about an independent test was properly denied because, while officers confiscated defendant's cell phone, defendant had spoken to his father several times and he had access to other phones after his release from custody; (3) any error in the admission of certain photographs of the victims was harmless based on the extent of the evidence against defendant; (4) defendant's claims regarding the improper imposition of restitution would not be addressed; and (5) defendant lacked the standing to make a facial constitutional challenge to the Criminal Punishment Code because his sentence did not include any enhancements and it was within the range established by the Code based solely on the jury's verdicts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction for possession of cocaine by the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida). He challenged, on substantive due process grounds, the facial constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.101, amended to remove guilty knowledge as an element of possession of a controlled substance and adding lack of knowledge of the illicit nature of a controlled substance as an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court found a rational relationship between the legitimate governmental interest in addressing the drug problem and the elimination of the difficult-to-prove element of knowledge of a substance's illicit nature. Defendant characterized the statute as removing an element of a crime, the mens rea of guilty knowledge, and making the lack of it an affirmative defense, thereby improperly shifting to a defendant the burden to disprove. The appeals court disagreed. The statute removed guilty knowledge as an element but did not require a defendant to prove or disprove knowledge. It was optional to raise lack of knowledge as a defense. The statute simply provided that once the defense was utilized, a permissive presumption attached allowing the jury to draw an inference from the facts. Only mandatory and conclusive presumptions were prohibited. Further, there was a rational purpose for this presumption, and it was tied to a legitimate governmental interest. Accordingly, the court rejected defendant's substantive due process challenge. The affirmative defense of lack of knowledge would have been available to defendant, but he was still required to request the instruction.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court found that the procedural scheme employed by the state department of using non-lawyer hearing officers did not run afoul of the Florida or United States Constitutions nor the due process rights of the motorists. Additionally, the state department contended that a circuit court erred in quashing a hearing officer's order of suspension, setting aside and vacating the suspension of a motorist's license, and directing the state department to expunge the suspension from the motorist's driving record because the court found that the hearing officer acted as an advocate for the state department and departed from her neutral role as magistrate during the administrative proceeding when she stopped the hearing, located a missing document, and entered it as evidence. The state supreme court found that the hearing officer departed from her neutral role as magistrate during the hearing and should have been recused.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates challenged the county's collections program, first contending that it was unconstitutional on its face because it provided for the incarceration of individuals who were unable to pay. The appeals court agreed. Moreover, this aspect of the county's program was inconsistent with Fla. Stat. ch. 938.30(2), which expressly provided for court-ordered community service where a defendant was unable to pay. The appeals court also agreed that Polk County, Fla., Cir. Ct. Admin. Order 7-12.0 violated the inmates' right to due process as it was debatable whether the inmates received sufficient notice requiring their appearance as provided for in Fla. Stat. ch. 938.30(3). What they received was a memorandum of sentence, better known in the county as a &quot;snap out.&quot; Under these facts, some of the snap outs were not signed by a judge and were thus inadequate to serve as orders requiring the recipient to appear for a hearing. Further, the administrative order did not require that those arrested and jailed for failure to pay be brought before the court at the earliest Wednesday available. Based on these facts, the inmates were entitled to habeas relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the legal father's challenge to the judgment entered against him, the appeals court held that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the statutes governing the executions of consent to adoption.

Additionally, the trial court's interpretation of the statute as denying a legal father standing to object to the termination of his parental rights was contrary to the legal interest afforded a legal father. A presumption of legitimacy to children born of a marriage existed and was based on the policy of protecting the welfare of the child. In the instant action, there was no apparent indication that the legislature intended to change the law with regard to the presumption of legitimacy, a result produced by the trial court's ruling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Stat. ch. 409.920(2)(a) (2001). The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charges. The State appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the charges after finding that Florida's Medicaid Provider Fraud Statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 409.920(2)(a) (2001), was preempted by the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1320a-7b(a). The federal act required that the crime be done &quot;knowingly and willfully&quot; while the Florida act required only that the act be done &quot;knowingly.&quot; Based on a recent precedent, the trial court determined that the state law was preempted by the federal statute. The appellate court held that considering the objective of Congress to limit and punish health care fraud and considering the language used in Fla. Stat. ch. 409.920(2)(a) (2001), notwithstanding the failure of Fla. Stat. ch. 409.920(2)(a) (2001) to contain the term &quot;willfully,&quot; the federal and state enactments regarding false claims were in harmony in purpose and effect and the charges at issue should not have been dismissed as preempted by federal law. The fear articulated in the earlier precedent that the Florida statute might criminalize activity that the federal statute intended to protect was not present in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner driver sought certiorari review of the Florida circuit court's denial of his petition for writ of certiorari. An administrative law judge upheld the administrative suspension of his driver's license. The driver sought certiorari review in the circuit court. He argued that his breath alcohol test results did not constitute proof of an unlawful blood alcohol level and that he was denied adequate notice of the charge against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's license was administratively suspended when his breath-alcohol test, administered after his arrest for driving under the influence (DUI), revealed blood alcohol levels of .100 and .102. The citation the driver was issued indicated he was arrested for driving with an unlawful blood alcohol level and that his license was suspended for that reason. The driver requested formal review of the suspension pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.2615 (2003). During the administrative review of his license suspension, his breath test results were admitted into evidence. The appellate court held that even without judicially including the term &quot;breath alcohol&quot; in the statute, the breath alcohol test results provided competent, substantial evidence that the driver had an unlawful blood alcohol level. The driver's application for formal review indicated he received notice of the license suspension and the reason for it, i.e., because he received a citation for DUI. The driver knew no blood test had been given, and that he had an unlawful breath alcohol. Consequently, he had actual notice of the reason his license was suspended.</SPAN></P>

The personal representative had previously permitted the trustee to use the road across his property, but the trustee had created a nuisance on the property by leasing it to a hunt club whose tenants were loud and annoying at all hours of the day and night and used the property in an unsanitary and unhealthy manner. Moreover, the legislature permitted a statutory way of necessity to allow the dominant tenement to be used only for those purposes which were set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 704.01(2) (2001). If landlocked property was to be used for a purpose other than the statutory purpose, a lawful easement or access had to be obtained other than through Fla. Stat. ch. 704.01(2) (2001).</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 790.001(1) (2001), and thus exempted under the Florida Statutes. To support his position, he claimed that because his rifle used black powder instead of fixed ammunition and its ignition system was a form of percussion cap, the weapon was an antique firearm. The trial court first ruled that dismissal was not warranted because it interpreted Fla. Stat. ch. 790.23 (2001) as prohibiting any firearm, whether antique or otherwise, from being possessed by a convicted felon. This ruling was incorrect as the statute provided that the firearm a convicted felon was prohibited from possessing excluded an antique firearm. However, because the rifle possessed by defendant included visible differences from an antique firearm such as a fiber optic sight, it was not a replica. Thus, dismissal of the charge was not warranted. Finally, the statute was constitutional because the term &quot;replica&quot; was not so vague as to render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Pinellas Count (Florida), which dismissed an information against defendant charging him with illegally possessing a weapon in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.23(1)(b) (2002) and which held that statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An information alleged that defendant violated Fla. Stat. ch. 790.23(1)(b) (2002) because he was 24 years old and had been found as a juvenile to have committed a burglary. He successfully moved to dismiss, arguing that an adjudication of delinquency was withheld and that ch. 790.23 was incongruous by requiring an adjudication of guilt to prove a violation of ch. 790.23(1)(a), yet still permitting a violation of ch. 790.23(1)(b) without an adjudication of delinquency. The trial court also held that ch. 790.23(1)(b) was unconstitutional. The State appealed. The court found that the differences in classification between ch. 790.23(1)(a)'s requirement of a prior guilt adjudication for criminal liability and ch. 790.23(1)(b)'s requirement of merely facts constituting a delinquent act to impose criminal liability was rationally related to preventing juvenile recidivism. Therefore, it did not violate equal protection. Moreover, since defendant's conduct fell squarely within the statute, it was not vague as applied to him. Finally, the statute was in pari materia with the headings of Fla. Stat. ch. 985.228(7), so it could be interpreted in accordance with its plain meaning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order dismissing the information against defendant and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in Broward County (Florida), which convicted him for third-degree felony murder and vehicular homicide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted and tried for first-degree felony murder and vehicular homicide (VH) after a person died in a car accident caused by defendant evading police after escaping from prison. A jury convicted him of the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder and for VH. The murder conviction was reversed due to lack of evidence on an essential element, and remand for a conviction on third-degree felony murder was ordered. The trial court complied with that mandate, but defendant appealed, arguing he was denied his constitutional right to a trial by jury by entering a conviction without proof of an essential element. The State initially argued that review was barred by the law of the case doctrine, but the court found that conviction of a crime where a jury did not find all essential elements was a manifest injustice that required review. Moreover, the jury's findings supported a conviction for manslaughter by culpable negligence. However, defendant was also convicted of VH. While a single death could not support both convictions and only one conviction could stand, the sentencing order was unclear on whether defendant was sentenced for VH or manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for third-degree murder and remanded for a determination whether defendant was already convicted and sentenced on the vehicular homicide offense. If so, that conviction and sentence would stand and would preclude the conviction and imposition of sentence on manslaughter by culpable negligence. Otherwise, discretion was allowed to convict and impose sentence on either crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Seventeenth Judicial Circuit Court, Broward County (Florida), entered a final judgment of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of possession of cocaine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of cocaine. Pertinent to that charge was Fla. Stat. ch. 893.101, which had been amended to remove guilty knowledge as an element of the possession of a controlled substance and which added lack of knowledge of the illicit nature of a controlled substance as an affirmative defense. Defendant was tried and convicted. On appeal, he challenged on substantive due process grounds the facial constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.101. He claimed that it improperly shifted the burden of proving lack of knowledge to him. The appellate court found that defendant did not challenge the constitutionality of that statute at trial, but could challenge it for the first time on appeal because a conviction for the violation of a facially invalid statute qualified as fundamental error. The appellate court then found that the statute did not impermissibly shift the burden to defendant to prove lack of knowledge, but merely allowed the jury to draw an inference from the facts if such a defense was raised. It also found that he was required to request a jury instruction on lack of knowledge, but in any event did not offer any evidence of lack of knowledge.</SPAN></P>

Stat. chs. 394.910-.931 (2003), challenged a decision by the Circuit Court for DeSoto County (Florida), which dismissed his petition for habeas corpus relief (HCR) from his detainment by appellees, the Secretary of the Department of Children and Family Services and the executive director of a state civil commitment center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the detainee's petition for HCR, finding that he failed to meet the exhaustion requirement of Fla. Stat. ch. 394.9215 (2003) and that none of the claims fell under the grounds in ch. 394.9215 that permitted a HCR petition. On appeal, the detainee argued that the trial court imposed an unconstitutional limitation on his right to seek habeas corpus relief. The court agreed that the trial court erroneously interpreted ch. 394.9215, which did not limit habeas corpus rights. However, the court affirmed dismissal since the detainee's claims were facially without merit. The court rejected the claim that the State violated a negotiated plea in his underlying criminal case by bringing the civil commitment proceeding because neither a negotiated plea nor equitable estoppel barred the State from bringing civil commitment proceedings under the Act. The detainee could not receive resentencing, even if his claim that the prison sentence in his criminal case was illegal. Since that challenge could have been made on direct appeal or by postconviction motion in the criminal case, the claim was not cognizable in a habeas corpus petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Pasco County (Florida) adjudicated defendant guilty of possession of diazepam, driving under the influence, driving while his license was suspended or revoked, and refusing to allow alcohol testing. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment entered, first contending that Fla. Stat. ch. 893.101 required him to prove that he lacked knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance, thereby relieving the State of its burden to prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. However, knowledge of the nature of a substance was not an element of the offense of possession. A defendant charged under that section could concede all the elements of the offense and still be able to assert the defense that he did not know of the illicit nature of the specific substance. Thus, the affirmative defense created by ch. 893.101 did not violate due process by abrogating the State's burden of proving the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, the trial court gave an incomplete instruction on the law by failing to inform the jury that defendant's lack of knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance was a defense to the possession charge. Further, though the trial court instructed the jury that defendant's knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance was an issue, it failed to provide any indication that lack of knowledge was a defense to the charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While a jury instruction given regarding the lack of knowledge affirmative defense was reversible error, the court rejected defendant's constitutionality argument as to the statutory elements of the possession of a controlled substance. Hence, the possession of diazepam conviction was reversed, and the matter was remanded for a new trial on this offense. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The probate court entered its order determining that the widow was entitled to an elective share, but it had not yet determined the amount of the elective share. The court dismissed the appeal because the probate court's order was a nonfinal order that could not be reviewed under Fla. R. App. P. 9.110(a)(2). Under Fla. Prob. R. 5.360, determination of an elective share was a two-step process. The first step, in which the probate court determined a surviving spouse's entitlement to the elective share, was a non-adversarial proceeding. Once the probate court found entitlement to the elective share, it would proceed to the second adversarial step of determining the amount of the share. It was only after completion of the second step that judicial labor with regard to the rights and obligations of the personal representative could come to an end and a final, appealable order be entered. As the probate court had only completed the first step, the court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss his Fla. Stat. Ch. 812.155 (2000) charge of failure to return leased equipment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found ch. 812.155(4)(b) created a mandatory presumption of intent, which relieved the State of its burden to prove an essential element of the offense, in violation of the due process clauses of the federal and Florida Constitutions. The appellate court reversed. The trial court had improperly relied on a decision by another division of the circuit court. The trial court's decision should have been based on prior precedent from the appellate court, which held that the language in ch. 812.155(4)(b) that the failure to return property within five days after receipt of a demand for its return was prima facie evidence of fraudulent intent, created a permissive inference, not a mandatory presumption. As the statute created a permissive inference, the statute could not be found facially unconstitutional. Rather, defendant was required to make an &quot;as-applied&quot; challenge to the statute. If the statute was found unconstitutional &quot;as-applied,&quot; the remedy would not be dismissal of the information. Rather, the State would have the right to take the case to trial without the benefit of the statutory presumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the claimant raised three issues: (1) whether the JCC erred by finding that no dispute existed for which the claimant was entitled to an independent medical examination (IME); (2) whether the JCC erred in rejecting a doctor's medical opinion and accepting his report for fact purposes only; and (3) whether Fla. Stat. ch. 440.13(5)(e) constituted an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers. As to the first issue, the appellate court found that there was a dispute concerning whether the claimant had reached psychiatric maximum medical improvement (MMI) and as to the claimant's entitlement to TPD benefits. The dispute arose because the claimant disagreed not only with the medical care she received by the authorized psychiatrist provided, but also with his determination that she had achieved MMI. Because the employer denied the claim for TPD benefits in part on the basis that the claimant had achieved overall MMI, the claimant's request to present medical opinion evidence from a psychiatric IME was directly related to demonstrating her entitlement to TPD benefits. Thus, the claimant was entitled to a psychiatric IME pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.13(5)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed as to the second and third issues. The appellate court reversed as to the first issue and remanded for the approval of a psychiatric IME.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the school board sought to declare invalid certain actions and orders of the State Board regarding three charter school applications submitted to the school board. Lastly, the school board sought an injunction. The State Board moved to change venue to Leon County based on its home venue privilege as its principal office was located in Leon County. The appellate court held that a county school board was not &quot;an individual&quot; within the meaning of the &quot;sword-wielder&quot; exception whose constitutional rights had been directly threatened by the State Board's actions. Any claimed invasion of the school board's constitutional rights was secondary. Consequently, the sword-wielder exception did not apply to excuse compliance with the home venue rule. Finally, there was no showing of particularized harm to the school board separate and apart from the generalized harm suffered by other school boards in Florida.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 812.155 (2001), but which held that ch. 812.155(4)(b) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 812.155(3). The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charge. However, it found that ch. 812.155(4)(b) created a mandatory presumption that relieved the State of its burden to prove fraudulent intent, which was an essential element of the offense. The trial court held that ch. 812.155(4)(b) was unconstitutional, as it violated the due process clauses of the U.S. and Florida Constitutions. On appeal, the court held that pursuant to Florida judicial precedent, the language of ch. 812.155(4)(b) was construed to create a permissive inference, not a mandatory presumption. The court found that the trial court departed from the essential requirements of the law when it reached the opposite conclusion. On remand, the trial court was to determine whether the presumed fact of a fraudulent intent was rationally connected to the proven fact of defendant's failure to return the property within five days of receipt of a demand for the return.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee taxpayer petitioned the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), to challenge appellant county property appraiser's denial of an ad valorem tax exemption under Fla. Stat. ch. 296.1978 (2000) to the taxpayer. The trial court found that the taxpayer was entitled to the exemption. The appraiser appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer purchased an apartment complex that provided affordable housing to low and very low income tenants. The purchase was financed through public housing revenue bonds. As a condition of the funding, the taxpayer entered into a Land Use Restriction Agreement (LURA) with the county housing finance authority. The LURA required that by a set date, 20 percent of the apartment units would be occupied by very low income tenants and an additional 55 percent by low income tenants. The remaining 25 percent were available for rent to the general public. The taxpayer took the position that if a unit was previously occupied by a low or very low income tenant but vacant on January 1st, the unit applied towards the Fla. Stat. ch. 196.1978 exemption. The appraiser argued that January 1st was the only relevant date and that if a unit was not occupied by a low or very low income tenant on January 1st, then the unit was not being used to provide affordable housing. On appeal, the court found that the taxpayer was not entitled to the affordable housing exemption as the occupancy of a unit by a low or very low income tenant on January 1st was necessary to trigger the ch. 196.1978 exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker argued that he needed the information to support a constitutional challenge on appeal to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.34(7) (2003). The worker asserted, inter alia, that the statutory cap on attorney's fees was a denial of due process and equal protection since employers and carriers were able to engage in excessive litigation to discourage representation of injured workers with low value claims. The court found that the challenged order compelled only disclosure of the rate charged by defense counsel and the hours expended. Counsel was not required to reveal information containing descriptions of the services. A bare accounting of hours worked and rates charged did not provide any insight into counsel's thought processes, and so did not violate the work product privilege. There was no showing of how the disclosure had any chilling effect on communication regarding the client's circumstances or its legal rights and obligations, so there was no violation of the attorney-client privilege. The information was relevant to the anticipated constitutional challenge. There was no showing that the JCC departed from the essential requirements of law in compelling the limited disclosure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a notice of intent to declare defendant a habitual offender pursuant to ch. 775.084 shortly after charges were filed.

The notice was not too general. That type of &quot;shotgun&quot; notice had previously been upheld and was valid. Defendant received that notice almost a full year before trial. The notice's language put defendant on guard as to the potential sentencing against him. Defendant knew he had been released from prison less than one year before he engaged in the new crimes charged against him. Defendant also knew the nature of the pending charges. Therefore, the notice was adequate. The notice did not violate Apprendi v. New Jersey.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a final summary judgment by the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida) entered in favor of appellee hospital. Because the hospital's alleged malpractice occurred no later than 1993, noting that appellant did not file suit until 2002, the trial court concluded that the four-year statute of repose contained in Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b) applied, barring his claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After treatment at the hospital, appellant suffered what an expert opined were radiation burns. Appellant first argued that the record supported a claim for ordinary negligence. The appeals court disagreed. The record established that his injury occurred in connection with medical diagnosis, treatment, and care provided by health care providers. Second, appellant contended that he did not learn he had been injured as a result of excess radiation exposure until 2001. He asserted that if the statute of repose was applied, then his cause of action was extinguished before he knew of his injury and before his cause of action accrued. The Florida Supreme Court had held that the statutory repose period for medical malpractice actions did not violate the constitutional mandate of access to courts, even when applied to a cause of action which did not accrue until after the period had expired. Based on the controlling precedent, the appeals court concluded that the trial court properly entered summary judgment in favor of the hospital.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of eight counts of armed sexual battery, one count of burglary with a battery, one count of false imprisonment, and one count of battery. On appeal, he claimed that the eight sexual battery charges violated double jeopardy because there was no spatial or temporal break between the acts alleged in the counts. The court disagreed because defendant committed different acts of sexual battery that were distinct from one another and temporally separated. Even though there were three events of vaginal penetration and three of anal penetration, each was separated from a similar event by another type of sexual battery. Thus, they were distinct in character and temporally separated, which gave defendant sufficient time between each penetration to reflect and form a new criminal intent. The court also found no double jeopardy violation in defendant's convictions for both burglary with a battery and battery. The burglary with a battery involved the sexual battery, while the separate battery charge consisted of other conduct of touching the victim's breasts and kissing her against her will. The battery was for conduct separate and apart from the sexual battery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it needed to dismiss the appeal because the court did not have jurisdiction to review the type of non-final order of the county court that certified a question of great public importance. Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4(b), and Fla. R. App. P. 9.030(b)(4) only allowed the court to review those non-final orders of a county court that were appealable to the circuit court under Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(c). The county court's order denying a motion in limine was not such an order that would have been appealable under Rule 9.140(c). The court rejected the State's contention that Fla. Stat. ch. 924.07(1)(h) or (l) made the order reviewable by the court, because those provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 924.07 cited by the sState had not been adopted by Rule 9.140(c). The court did find, pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(b) and Fla. Stat. ch. 924.07(1)(h), that the circuit court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Florida charged defendant in the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), with racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering, operating an organized scheme to defraud, filing a false or fraudulent tax return, grand theft, sale of obscene material, and four counts of operating an unlicensed adult book store. The trial court dismissed the four counts of operating an unlicensed adult book store. The State of Florida appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from the operation of a business, which the State alleged was an unlicensed adult book store. Defendant moved to dismiss the charges, contending that the definition of &quot;adult book store&quot; in the Orange County, Florida, Adult Entertainment Code was unconstitutionally vague, and that the code failed to provide for prompt judicial review in the event an application for an adult entertainment license was denied. Finding merit in the arguments, the trial court dismissed the four counts of operating an unlicensed adult book store. On appeal, the court found that the definition of adult book store found in Orange County, Fla., Code &sect; 3-6 (2002) was not unconstitutionally vague. Further, any ambiguity in the meaning of the terms as applied in the code was readily subject to a narrowing construction by the Florida courts. Finally, while under the code neither a direct appeal, nor certiorari review was available to an unsuccessful adult entertainment license applicant, an original action brought in the circuit court for a declaratory judgment under Fla. Stat. ch. 86.021 (2004) provided judicial review sufficient to pass constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order was reversed, and the matter was remanded with directions that the four counts of operating an unlicensed adult book store be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Madison County (Florida) granted a statutory way of necessity to petitioner, a property owner, over property owned by respondent, an estate, pursuant to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner alleged that he needed the way of necessity in order to use his landlocked property for timber raising, for agricultural purposes, and for dwellings. The estate claimed that the owner had been allowed to use the road across the property, and had created a nuisance by leasing the property to a hunt club whose tenants were loud and annoying at all hours of the day and night and used the property in an unsanitary and unhealthy manner. The trial court denied the estate's request to limit the use of the way of necessity in order to exclude the hunters. The appellate court held that when Fla. Stat. chs. 704.01(2) and 704.04 were read in pari materia, it was clear that the legislature had permitted a statutory way of necessity for only those uses which were enumerated in Fla. Stat. ch. 704.01(2), specifically for a dwelling or dwellings, agricultural, timber raising or cutting or stock raising purposes. Thus, the appellate court held that the trial court erred in failing to restrict the use of the easement.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 409.9122(13) (2003) was a general law and not a special or local law that would be subject to the notice requirements of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to the enactment of Fla. Stat. ch. 409.9122(13), which required the AHCA to adjust enrollee assignments for Medicaid-managed prepaid plans operating in a certain county, the company suffered a significant loss of Medicaid-eligible assignments. The company filed a complaint alleging that ch. 409.9122(13) was unconstitutional because it was a local law that was enacted without compliance with the notice requirements of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. On counter-motions for summary judgment, the trial court ruled that the statute was constitutional, and it entered final summary judgment for the AHCA. The company appealed. The court found that while the statute, on its face, applied only to one county, it was a general law that was not subject to constitutional notice requirements because it had a material statewide impact on the state's Medicaid program. Fla. Stat. ch. 409.9122(13) was enacted as part of a statewide program. Also, due to the significant size of the Medicaid population in the county affected by the statute, the legislature could have reasonably determined that restructuring there would impact the Medicaid program on a statewide basis.</SPAN></P>

The court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment for the first offense and concurrent terms of 337.5 months for the other offenses. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the sentences for the two first-degree felony sexual battery by a person in familial or custodial authority offenses far exceeded the applicable maximum sentence under the Fla.

He contended that the trial court's determination, in enhancing the sentence, that penetration occurred violated the Sixth Amendment under the Apprendi rule. The State of Florida countered that, in finding defendant guilty, the jury necessarily concluded that penetration occurred. On appeal, the court found that, while the jury found that sexual penetration occurred regarding one of the sexual battery by a person in familial or custodial authority offenses, the jury's verdict finding defendant guilty of the other sexual battery by a person in familial or custodial authority offense did not, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(1)(h) (1997), embody a factual determination by the jury that the offense involved sexual penetration. Therefore, the sentences imposed for those two convictions violated defendant's Sixth amendment right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, the parents of the incapacitated person (daughter), filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.540(b)(4). The trial court denied the motion; the parents appealed and filed a motion for a stay pending appeal. Appellee guardian was also involved in the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that clear and convincing evidence established that the daughter, who had suffered a heart attack, was in a persistent vegetative state and that, if able to do so, would have elected to forego the use of a feeding tube. It ordered that nutrition and hydration no longer be provided. In response to that order, the state legislature passed an act pursuant to which the governor ordered a stay of the order. The Florida Supreme Court found the act to be unconstitutional. A guardian appointed at the request of the governor opined that the daughter's movements were merely reflexive and that she was in persistent vegetative state. The instant court rejected the parents' claim that the judgment was void for lack of jurisdiction. The trial court was empowered under Fla. Stat. ch. 765.401(3) to determine what the daughter would have decided in light of her persistent vegetative state, and the procedures followed did not violate her right to due process or privacy. The parents were allowed to present evidence as they were guardians and were allowed, contrary to precedent, to file successive and repetitive Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.540(b) motions, none of which had merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee arrestee sued appellant city, challenging the legality and constitutionality of Tampa, Fla., Code &sect; 14-27 (2002), which allowed police to impound a vehicle upon probable cause to believe it was used to facilitate drug crimes or prostitution. The Circuit Court for Hillsborough County, Florida, granted the arrestee's motions for summary judgment, class certification, and a preliminary injunction. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city claimed it impounded the arrestee's car after an accident, found marijuana in an inventory search, charged him with possession, and impounded his car under &sect; 14-27. He paid a bond for the release of the car and towing and storage charges. After a hearing master found probable cause, the arrestee forfeited these funds. He argued that &sect; 14-27 was preempted by the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act, Fla. Stat. chs. 932.701-.707 (2003), and violated due process. The appellate court held it could not review the non-final order granting summary judgment, and that, based on district court precedent, the injunction was properly granted. However, the order certifying a class of all owners of vehicles impounded under the ordinance was defective as it did not contain the findings of fact required by Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(d)(1) and the trial court had no testimony or affidavits to permit it to enter adequate factual determinations. The trial court did not give sufficient consideration to the arrestee's adequacy as class representative and the disturbing effect on persons once accused of drug or prostitution crimes of having opt-out notification mailed to their homes under Rule 1.220.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the temporary injunction, but reversed the order granting the motion for class certification and remanded for further consideration of that motion.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 212.06(9) and alleging that it was improperly denied a renewal of its certificate of exemption from state sales and use tax. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) granted the department's motion for summary judgment. The religious cooperative appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the religious cooperative had standing and that Fla. Stat. ch. 212.06(9) was constitutional.  The trial court also ruled that the religious cooperative failed to exhaust its administrative remedies regarding obtaining a renewal of its certificate of exemption. As part of its response, the department argued that the religious cooperative was without standing to bring its challenge. The appellate court found that the religious cooperative, as a religious organization, benefited from the sales tax exemption. Accordingly, the religious cooperative failed to have the adverse interest necessary for standing and was not the proper party to assert the instant constitutional challenge. Both parties briefed the standing issue without objection. Furthermore, standing was argued, almost exclusively, during oral argument without objection. Accordingly, the issue was before the appellate court and it was not barred from considering standing, despite the fact that the trial court's standing determination was not cross-appealed by the department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and vacated, and the case was remanded to the trial court with directions to enter final summary judgment in favor of the department on the basis that the religious cooperative did not have standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were all represented by the same counsel, entered pleas of not guilty, and filed identical motions to dismiss the information pursuant to Fla.

The parties stipulated that none of the machines involved were coin-operated and that the businesses utilized gift certificates and gift cards as payment for credits earned on the machines. The trial court found that there was some skill that could be developed in the games, although it was &quot;minimal&quot; skill. The trial court next found that the businesses were open to the public even though they excluded minors. The trial court denied defendants' motions to dismiss and agreed that its ruling had the effect of rendering the seized machines illegal under Florida Statutes. The appellate court began by noting that the bulk of defendants' arguments had been recently rejected. Also, Fla. Stat. chs. 849.01, 849.15 and 849.161 were not impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Citrus County (Florida) found for the cable television company and awarded attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 57.105(1)-(3). The appraiser appealed and the cable television company cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cable television company argued that the appraiser's unit method of valuation used in the assessment at issue was declared unconstitutional prior to the trial in the case at bar, and that the appraiser should have known that the assessment of the property was based upon a method declared unconstitutional. The appellate court found that substantial, competent evidence was presented to support the trial court's order. Costs were properly adjudicated after final judgment, after the expiration of the appeal period, during the pendency of an appeal, and even after the appeal had been concluded. Therefore, the trial court had jurisdiction to enter an attorney's fee award despite the fact that the appeal of the final judgment was pending. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting relief pursuant to Fla. R. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of children and families filed a shelter petition for a child and his sibling. After placement of the child with appellee aunt in New Hampshire was unsuccessful, the department sought placement in Florida.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department argued that the trial court violated the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), Fla. Stat. ch. 409.401 (2001), by returning the child to the aunt over the opposition of the New Hampshire authorities. Florida initially placed the child in New Hampshire with the aunt after it received a positive home study as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 409.401 art. III(d) (2001). However, New Hampshire subsequently recommended that the child be returned to Florida because it was believed that the aunt could no longer meet the child's needs. In essence, New Hampshire rescinded its placement approval. Florida retained jurisdiction, and the child was returned to the department's custody in Florida. The appellate court held that the ICPC applied to the aunt, and that the trial court had no authority to return the child to New Hampshire without a reapplication of Fla. Stat. ch. 409.401 art. III(d) (2001).</SPAN></P>

The former litigant challenged the omission of the variances and claimed that the omission did not involve mere &quot;scrivener errors.&quot; He received a quasi-judicial hearing from one of the government entities, and subsequent appellate review from the trial and appellate courts, which rejected his claim. Thereafter, the former litigant filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the county ordinance used to approve the parking non-use variances was unconstitutional and that the omissions of the variances were not &quot;scrivener errors.&quot; The trial court granted the government entities' motions to dismiss and for partial summary judgment. On appeal, the appellate court found that the challenge to the constitutionality of the county ordinance was barred by the four-year statute of limitations applicable to declaratory judgment actions and the challenge to the omissions of the variances from the resolution was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>

Upon stopping the vehicle, however, they observed a gun in plain view. The resulting search of the car produced over 40 bags of marijuana. The appellate court held that because a windshield was required by Fla. Stat. ch. 316.2952, it was a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.610 to drive a vehicle with a windshield that was not in proper condition and adjustment. Ch. 316.610(1) expressly authorized an officer to stop and inspect a vehicle if the officer had reasonable cause to believe that it was not equipped as required by law. Therefore, whether the crack created any immediate hazard was immaterial. Ch. 316.610(1) did not violate the Fourth Amendment because owners and operators of cars were expected to know the legal requirements for vehicle equipment and could not expect their sense of personal privacy to prevent police from briefly stopping a car that reasonably appeared to have an equipment violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County Court for Franklin County (Florida) ruled that Fla. Stat. ch. 370.093(2)(b) (2000), which penalized the unlawful use of a grill or entangling net made of monofilament, was unconstitutionally vague and unenforceable under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect;&nbsp;4(b)(1). Thus, both defendants' convictions and sentences were vacated. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county court concluded that Fla. Stat. ch. 370.093(2)(b) was unconstitutionally vague for failure to give reasonable notice of the conduct it prohibited. The appeals court first held that the validity of the statute turned on whether it was unconstitutionally vague because the term &quot;monofilament&quot; was ambiguous. The appeals court held that it was not, as the dictionary definition of the term as a single untwisted synthetic filament made in varying diameters for use in textiles, hosiery, and screens or as bristles, fishing lines, and sutures was neither obscure or perplexing as applied in the statute. Further, the term had a fixed and definite meaning. Thus, the statute was not so vague that persons of ordinary intelligence must guess at its meaning, it was sufficiently clear to allow reasonable and uniform enforcement, and defendants had adequate notice of the statute and what it prohibited. Finally, because the State presented direct evidence that defendants were using a net to fish, and adequate, circumstantial evidence that the net used was not the legal net on deck, defendants were not entitled to an acquittal, even if Fla. Stat. ch. 370.093(2)(b) (2000) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the convictions and fines imposed were reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee newspaper sought disclosure of Florida teachers' social security numbers through public records requests. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) ruled that appellants, the Florida Department of Education (DOE) and its Commissioner, did not fully comply with the newspaper's requests and that the information the newspaper sought in its 2003 and 2004 requests constituted public record with no applicable statutory exemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the DOE argued that it was not required to produce social security numbers in response to the newspaper's April 2004 request for updated and historical data because the request was not verified as Florida law required. The appellate court agreed. The newspaper's April 2004 requests were not verified as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 119.0721(3). In addition, the DOE argued that although applicants for certification were required to submit social security numbers, disclosure of those numbers was expressly limited to the administration of child support enforcement pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 1012.56(1) (2003). The appellate court concluded that because the newspaper's request did not further the program of enforcing child support obligations, locating noncustodial parents, establishing paternity, or obtaining child support, the DOE properly denied the request. Finally, the DOE had provided data from the staff database pursuant to the June and September 2003 requests, including social security numbers, but the data omitted information for two counties. The DOE was required to produce the same information for these two counties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a name change, alleging that he was convicted of a felony in 1980, that he sought to change his name in accordance with his religious beliefs, and that he had no illegal or ulterior motive in seeking such a name change. After a telephonic hearing, the circuit court, citing Fla. Stat. ch. 68.07, denied the petition. The circuit court found that, under ch. 68.07(2)(k), a petition for name change had to be denied if the petitioner was a convicted felon and had not had have his civil rights restored. On appeal of that denial, petitioner contended that denying his petition was error because his felony conviction occurred before the effective date of ch. 68.07(2)(k) and thus that paragraph did not apply. The court agreed. There was no indication that the 1995 amendment at 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 283, &sect; 1 that added Fla. Stat. ch. 68.07(2)(k) applied retroactively. Because petitioner's felony conviction occurred in 1980, which was before the effective date of ch. 68.07(2)(k), the trial court erred when it retroactively applied that section to the name change petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On behalf of all mobile homeowners in a park, appellant mobile homeowners' association sued appellee park owners. The Circuit Court for Pinellas County, Florida, certified a class, designated the association as class representative, required notification of the class, and allowed class members out. The notice had to caution the homeowners that they could be liable for attorneys' fees if the association did not prevail. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association alleged the park did not enforce rules barring people under 55 from living there or rules restricting pets. Under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.222, mobile homeowners' associations could file suits on behalf of all mobile homeowners without complying with the requirements for general class action suits in Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220. The appellate court noted that Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.222 did not specify what procedures had to be followed. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 723.075 (2003), only two-thirds of the mobile homeowners in a park had to join a mobile homeowners' association. Although neither party appealed the certification of a class consisting of all mobile homeowners in the park as of a certain date, the appellate court was concerned that the association might be unable to represent the interests of owners with pets or who were under 55. Whether owners who did not opt out of the suit could be liable for attorneys' fees was also unclear. However, these issues were not ripe for review. The trial court had discretion to enter the order requiring notice to all affected mobile homeowners of the action, in the absence of more specific procedures in Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.222.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court approved the trial court's decision to notify the mobile homeowners of the lawsuit and expressed no opinion on the content of that notification. It granted the owners' motion for appellate attorneys' fees, contingent upon their prevailing in the trial court, only against the association and not against the mobile homeowners because they were not parties and had not been formally noticed concerning the appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 24-year-old male, was accused of having intercourse with a 14-year-old girl. She later identified defendant to police as the person with whom she had intercourse. Thereafter, at his workplace, defendant agreed to talk with a detective. They spoke in the detective's car. The detective secretly recorded the conversation. The detective then told defendant two falsehoods, to the effect that the victim was claiming forcible rape and that the detective had forensic evidence of a sexual encounter between the victim and defendant. The detective invited defendant to tell &quot;his side of the story&quot; and defendant admitted having sex with the victim. At trial, defendant's counsel did not move to suppress the confession. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, defendant claimed the confession was coerced and the admission of it was fundamental error. The appellate court found that any error in admitting it was not fundamental, and, therefore, that issue was not cognizable on appeal. It so concluded because it found that, even though, defendant had not raised the issue in the trial court, the guilty verdict could have been obtained even without the assistance of the alleged error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss an information alleging he violated Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By information the State alleged that defendant violated Fla. Stat. ch. 790.23(1)(b) because he was under 24 years old, in possession of a firearm, and was found to have committed the delinquent act of felony burglary while a juvenile. The trial court dismissed the information after finding the statute was unconstitutional. The State appealed. The court rejected defendant's contentions that the statute violated either due process or equal protection, that the statute was vague, or that ch. 790.23(1)(b) required an adjudication of delinquency (AD) and his AD was withheld. The statute properly distinguished between adults convicted of a felony and juveniles found to have committed delinquent acts that would be a felony for an adult because there were fundamental differences between criminal adult proceedings and juvenile proceedings. Under the rational relationship test, both procedural due process and equal protection were satisfied. Because defendant's conduct fell squarely within ch. 790.23(1)(b), the statute was not vague. Finally, there was no basis to read beyond the plain meaning of ch. 790.23(1)(b), which encompassed juveniles whose AD was withheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order dismissing the information and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former inmate claimed that he was imprisoned by the corrections department longer than his court-imposed sentences in three unrelated cases. He argued that the corrections department held him after the expiration of one sentence, and then made no attempt to ascertain the intent of a sentencing judge where there was confusion about the concurrent and coterminous language of another one of his three sentences as to which of the other sentences the concurrent and coterminous language applied. On appeal, the court found that the corrections department properly treated the concurrent and coterminous language of one of the former inmate's sentences as a nullity. The corrections department then had before it an otherwise valid sentence, which did not mention the former inmate's other sentence. Under the circumstances, the corrections department was then required to run the sentence consecutive to the former inmate's remaining sentence pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 921.16(1) (1995). Further, the rule of lenity, under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.021 (1988), had no applicability. Finally, there was no violation of the separation of powers doctrine under Fla. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of the judgment of appellee Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) which found it liable for failing to clean up used oil discharges. The corporation argued, inter alia, that the finding by and administrative law judge (ALJ) that he discharged oil was not supported by competent, substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation operated an auto parts salvage operation on some land owned by the land owner. After discovering environmental problems on the property, the corporation extricated itself from an agreement to purchase the property. The DEP subsequently inspected the property. The land owner told DEP inspectors that the corporation was responsible for a 55 gallon drum that was tipped over and leaking what appeared to be used oil. The inspection also revealed other unlabeled drums, containers, oil filters, battery casings, and areas of dark-stained soil in the area where the corporation had operated. The ALJ found the corporation failed to respond to used oil discharges. The court held that the only direct evidence presented by DEP that the corporation was responsible was the objected-to hearsay testimony of the land owner. There was no evidence regarding the age of the spills. Thus, DEP failed to present competent substantial evidence that the corporation was responsible for the discharges. In addition, DEP's policy of requiring a person cited to conduct testing to prove his innocence improperly shifted the burden of proof. The DEP lacked authority to impose an unpromulgated rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the DEP was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fireworks seller challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida), which dismissed its action seeking a declaration that appellee county's ordinance restricting the sale of fireworks under Pinellas, Fla. County Ordinance 03-48 (ordinance) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller objected to the ordinance, arguing it was unconstitutional because it was preempted by Fla. Stat. ch. 791 (2003) either expressly or by implication. In the alternative, it argued that the ordinance, or portions of it, facially conflicted with ch. 791. When the seller's declaratory judgment action was dismissed, the seller appealed. The court found that ch. 791 contained no express preemption and the statute was not so pervasive to justify implied preemption. As to conflict, one sentence in the ordinance, &sect; 2, conflicted with Fla. Stat. ch. 791.06 (2003) because it imposed additional fines or terms of imprisonment to what were proper penalties for violating Fla. Stat. ch. 791.06. However, the ordinance, &sect; 7, allowed any part that was found unconstitutional to be severed from the rest of the ordinance. A person or entity could comply with the requirements of the ordinance without violating ch. 791, and vice versa. While the ordinance imposed additional burdens on those engaged in the fireworks business in the county, the additional burdens were not prohibited by ch. 791. The burdens supplemented, rather than contradicted, ch. 791.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment only to the extent of holding that one sentence of the ordinance that conflicted with a state statute was unconstitutional and had to be severed from the ordinance. The court affirmed the judgment in all other respects and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Manatee County (Florida) entered final summary judgment determining that defendant owners were the proper owners of lands formerly submerged beneath the Manatee River and subsequently exposed by dredge and fill activities. Plaintiff, a condominium association, appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association argued that it was the proper owner under Fla.

Stat. ch. 253.12(9) (2003) was unconstitutional. The owners argued that they were the proper owners under Fla. Stat. ch. 253.12(9) (2003) because they were the record title holders of the filled lands. Fla. Stat. ch. 53.12(9) divested the State of its ownership of lands filled before July 1, 1975. A developer recorded a quit claim deed to the filled land in question prior to the effective date of the statute, and the land was subsequently transferred to the owners. The appellate court held that the developer's quit claim deed became effective with the enactment of Fla. Stat. ch. 253.12(9) (2003). It was clear from the record that the deed to the developer was prepared and filed in good faith, and was not an attempt to steal land from the State. As the developer's successor in interest, the owners thus were the proper owners of the land. The appellate court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 253.12(9) (2003) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former inmate sued defendant Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) in the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) for negligence and false imprisonment for allegedly imprisoning him for longer than his court-imposed sentences. The inmate and DOC each moved for summary judgment, and the trial court granted DOC's motion and denied that of the inmate. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate received three sentences at various times. The last sentence was to be concurrent with the first, but the first was served when the last was imposed, and the last sentence did not mention the second sentence. The appellate court held the Department of Corrections (DOC) correctly gave no effect to the concurrent language in the last sentence. Because the last sentence did not mention the second sentence, Fla. Stat. ch. 921.16(1) (1995) required the last sentence to be consecutive to the second. A failure to implement concurrent language of the last sentence did not violate separation of powers in Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3 as that language was a nullity. The last sentence did not have to be construed in the inmate's favor, under the rule of lenity, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.021(1) (1988), because instead of being ambiguous, the sentence's concurrent language had no effect. As the sentencing court's stated no intent that the last sentence be concurrent to the second, DOC statutorily had to run it consecutively to the second sentence, and the rule of lenity did not apply. Double jeopardy was not violated as the sentences were for different crimes in different cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida), which convicted defendant of burglary, aggravated, battery, and false imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the burglary charge, the trial court charged on the &quot;remaining in&quot; portion of the burglary instruction. Under the Delgado decision, the facts in the case did not support that portion of the instruction. Thus, defendant could not be convicted of burglary unless he had the requisite intent to commit theft or robbery when he entered the dwelling. The court then certified three questions of great public importance. The first dealt with whether an amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 810.02 legislatively overruled the Florida Supreme Court's decision in Delgado as to cases not final at the time of that decision in which offenses were committed before February 1, 2000, thereby permitting a trial court to instruct a jury that it might find a defendant guilty of burglary despite evidence showing a legal entry into a premises and that an offense was committed therein while the defendant remained within non-surreptitiously? The other two questions asked whether Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 9 applied to changes in law based on judicial opinions and if so, how could art. X, &sect; 9 be reconciled with giving changes in law application in pipeline cases when a crime was committed before a change in the law?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's burglary conviction was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial on that charge. The remaining convictions were affirmed without comment. On remand, the trial court was directed to consider whether the outcome of the burglary charge necessitated resentencing on the aggravated battery and false imprisonment charges. If so, the trial court was to resentence defendant accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Martin County (Florida), which denied his motion to correct an illegal sentence under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the State conceded that defendant was improperly sentenced on a violation of probation by an increase on his guidelines scoresheet for the primary offense, from level 8 to level 9. The increase in scoresheet level was based on a law that was struck down by Heggs. Applying Heggs, the increase should not have been applied to defendant. Rather, the 1994 scoresheet had to be applied. However, the State argued that relief was not properly sought under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a). The appellate court concluded that even though defendant should have employed a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b) motion in the trial court to challenge his unconstitutional sentence, the sentence imposed, in excess of the statutory maximum, was the type of fundamental sentencing error that could be raised on appeal absent preservation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida), which imposed a sentence on defendant for the offense of trafficking in methylenedioxymetheamphetamine (MDMA) following a no contest plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest to the offense of trafficking in MDMA. The trial court sentenced defendant. The State appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in not imposing the three-year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking in MDMA weighing between 10 and 200 grams. The court held that at the time the trial court imposed the sentence, the district had decided that a mandatory minimum sentence for the offense of trafficking in MDMA was unconstitutional. Thus, the trial court lacked the discretion to impose a mandatory minimum sentence on defendant. Thereafter, the state's highest court decided to allow the minimum sentence. Accordingly, a mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking in MDMA, imposed under 2000 Fla. Laws ch. 320, was a legal sentence. The trial court had a nondiscretionary duty to impose the three-year mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(k)(2) (2001). On remand, defendant should be permitted to withdraw his plea to the charge of trafficking in MDMA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's sentence of defendant and remanded the matter for further proceedings where defendant could have the opportunity to withdraw his plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) entered an involuntary civil commitment order against appellant patient as a sexually violent predator under Fla. Stat. chs. 394.910-394.931 (2001). The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the hearing, the patient's counsel repeatedly objected to the admission of hearsay concerning alleged prior uncharged bad acts, claiming that while the hearsay might have been admissible under Fla. Stat. ch. 394.9155, the patient had no ability to defend himself because he was incapable of assisting her in disputing the factual allegations due to his incompetence. The instant court agreed, as not only did that deny the patient his due process right to present a defense, but it also denied him his right to counsel because counsel could not effectively defend him without his assistance. The appointment of a guardian ad litem was no substitute for a competent defendant. The court's concern was not with the patient's substantive due process rights, but with his procedural due process rights. Not every Ryce Act respondent had to be competent during a Ryce Act proceeding, but a Ryce Act respondent had a due process right to be competent only when the State intended to present hearsay evidence of alleged facts that were neither admitted by way of a plea nor subjected to adversarial testing at trial, and thus subject to dispute and counterevidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that while the parents completed many of their case plan tasks, this did not equate to &quot;substantial compliance&quot; with their case plan under Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(68). But as the Department failed to prove termination was in the manifest best interests of the children, under Fla.

Stat. ch. 847.0135 (2002), and transmission of materials harmful to a minor, Fla. Stat. ch. 847.0138 (2002), after the trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the counts as unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant engaged in Internet chat room and on-line conversations about sex with a Florida deputy sheriff, who posed as a 13-year-old Florida girl named Sandi. Defendant sent nude photographs of himself and eventually traveled to Florida to meet &quot;Sandi&quot; in a hotel room and engage in sexual relations with her. Defendant was arrested upon his arrival at the hotel. Defendant argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 847.0138 was overbroad because it limited communications on the Internet to those which would only be suitable for children, thereby depriving adults of their constitutional right to engage in protected speech. On appeal, the court found that ch. 847.0138 was not unconstitutional as it only pertained to harmful images, information, or data sent to a specific individual known by the defendant to be a minor, via electronic mail. Therefore, under ch. 847.0138, adults were not deprived of their constitutional right to engage in protected speech as only communications to a minor were prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant companies sought review of the final orders of appellee Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The issues were (1) whether an amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 403.412(5) relating to standing to challenge decisions of DEP was violative of the single subject requirement and (2) whether the alleged single subject violation was rendered moot by the subsequent readoption of the revised Fla. Stat. ch. 403.412.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DEP dismissed two petitions on the ground that the companies could not establish standing under the requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 403.412(5). The Florida Legislature did not expressly state in 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 261 that the amendment was to apply retroactively. The changes to Fla. Stat. ch. 403.412(5) made by 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 261 eliminated the companies' previous right to initiate a proceeding upon notice of DEP's intent to issue a permit. Essentially a class of people no longer had a right where one existed before. The provisions contained within 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 261 did not violate the single subject requirement. Each provision in the act was logically related to environmental protection and was specifically related to Everglades restoration. Each provision in the act was germane to the overall purpose stated in the act. All of the provisions related to the protection of the environment and to the policies and practices of the DEP. The act also promoted the clear purpose of the legislation. The legislation was valid on its face, and the title of the bill was sufficiently broad to encompass the subject matter of the bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the DEP was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 775.21(4) (2002), after he pled guilty to sexual battery and kidnaping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant posed as a police officer and threatened alleged prostitutes over the age of 18 with arrest in order to gain sexual favors. He was charged with sexual battery and kidnaping. He pled nolo contendere in four cases and agreed to a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment followed by 45 years of sex offender probation. The State subsequently filed a notice in each of the four cases that defendant qualified as a sexual predator. Prior to accepting the plea agreement, the trial court advised defendant that in all likelihood he would be declared a sexual predator. The trial court subsequently entered orders in each case declaring that he was a sexual predator. On appeal, defendant challenged his sexual predator designation and asserted that the trial court's ruling violated his substantive due process rights. The court found that defendant's designation as a sexual predator did not influence the merits of his criminal conviction or affect the foundation of his case. Because the trial court's designation was a collateral matter and did not constitute fundamental error, defendant's failure to present his argument to the trial court precluded appellate review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Florida Department of State, Division of Elections sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) which entered a mandatory injunction directing the Division to, inter alia, permit a Democratic candidate for Congress to withdraw and notify appellee Democratic Party Executive Committee officials of their right to designate a nominee to fill the vacancy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A congressional candidate stated that he wished to withdraw as a candidate. The Division informed him that, in the interest of avoiding disruption and confusion, he would not be permitted to withdraw. The Democratic Executive Committee obtained a mandatory injunction requiring the Division to declare that a vacancy was created by the candidate's withdrawal. The appellate court held that the Florida Legislature intended that Fla. Stat. ch. 101.253 (2004) governed when and how a candidate could seek to withdraw his or her name from nomination and be removed from the ballot. Fla. Stat. ch. 100.111 (2004) was intended to address the next step. Because the second sentence of Fla. Stat. ch. 101.253(2) vested unbridled discretion in the Florida Department of State, Division of Elections, it violated Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3 and was, therefore, unconstitutional. Accordingly, Fla. Stat. ch. 101.253(2) was unconstitutional in its entirety. The candidate's withdrawal had to be recognized. Fla. Stat. ch. 100.111(4)(b) was then the applicable procedure to be employed for the selection of a replacement nominee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant took issue with several pretrial rulings of the trial court, several evidentiary rulings that took place during the course of trial, the State's closing argument, and the jury instructions. The trial court allowed use of the Rapid Risk Assessment for Sex Offense Recidivism (RRASOR), Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) and the Sexual Violence Risk-20 (SVR-20) tests. The appellate court ruled that the RRASOR and PCL-R tests met the requirements of Frye. Given the nature of the SVR-20, it was not the type of objective scientific principle or test with which Frye was concerned. Any testimony regarding the use and application of the SVR-20 was tantamount to pure opinion testimony, which was admissible without having to satisfy Frye. The State did not violate its plea agreement to a term of incarceration followed by probation by seeking civil commitment under the Jimmy Ryce Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 394.910-.931 (1999), after the term of incarceration was served. The trial court's use of the term &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; was not improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlocked owners appealed from two partial summary judgments entered by the Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida) in favor of appellee property owners in the landlocked owners' suit seeking to establish a statutory way of necessity under Fla. Stat. ch. 704.01(2) (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlocked owners argued that the Florida Marketable Record Titles to Real Property Act (MRTA), Fla. Stat. ch. 712, did not preclude relief. The appellate court held that statutory ways of necessity did not require a common source of title and were dependent upon factors not required for common law ways of necessity. Further, statutory ways of necessity were based on public policy, while common law ways of necessity were not. Thus, language in prior case law on statutory ways of necessity did not control. The right to a statutory way of necessity was a present right that came into existence when the necessary factors existed. As it was a present right, it was not a right, claim, or interest that would predate the root of title to the servient estate and was not extinguishable by the MRTA. Further, the constitutional validity of Fla. Stat. ch. 704.01(2) (2003) was based on public policy concerns, as was the constitutional validity of eminent domain proceedings. As the right to acquire property by eminent domain proceedings could not be extinguished by the MRTA, the right to acquire access to landlocked property via ch. 704.01(2) could not be extinguished by the MRTA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Court, Palm Beach County (Florida), granted summary judgment to appellees, two clinics and a doctor, finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 390.0111 (1997), 1997 Fla. Laws ch. 151, &sect; 1, also known as the Women's Right to Know Act (Act), was unconstitutional. Appellants, the State of Florida through the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Department of Health (the State), sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the Act impermissibly intruded upon the woman's right to choose at every stage of her pregnancy without furthering a compelling State interest. The trial court also held that: (1) the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it required the physician performing the abortion to satisfy a unique and confusing reasonable patient standard; and (2) the issue was ripe for summary judgment since the Act was unconstitutional on its face. The State argued on appeal that summary judgment was improper because a factual record could be developed to demonstrate that the Act did not result in an increased cost to the woman, caused no intrusion on the physician's practice, and allowed the physician discretion. The appeals court disagreed. Even if the State could support its positions, the Act was unconstitutional because it imposed significant obstacles and burdens intruding upon a woman's choice between abortion and childbirth. Further, to sever the challenged portions of the statute would sever subsections of the informed consent section. To do so reduced the section to being nonsensical and incomplete.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Florida Board of Professional Engineers (Board) entered a final order denying appellant applicant's petition for licensure as an engineer by endorsement, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 471.015(3)(a), (b) (2002). The applicant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board concluded that the applicant was ineligible for a license by endorsement under Fla. Stat. ch. 471.015(3)(a), because he did not receive a degree from a Board-approved engineering program. It also held that when the applicant received his Pennsylvania license, that state did not require accreditation from the Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET). So, Pennsylvania did not have a statute that was substantially the same as Florida's and therefore the applicant was not eligible for licensure under Fla. Stat. ch. 471.015(3)(b). On appeal, the court first held, and the Board conceded, that a scrivenor's error existed as to the state in which the applicant was licensed. Thus, this was to be corrected. Second, while the Board promulgated a rule specifying criteria for approval of schools and curricula for applicants having degrees for foreign schools where ABET accreditation was unavailable, it failed and refused to promulgate a similar rule where ABET accreditation was available, contrary to the intent of Fla. Stat. ch. 471.013(1)(a). Thus, the Board was ordered to promulgate said rules. Due to this holding, the applicant's equal protection argument was not addressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amended settlement agreement created a common fund of $ 14 million from which class members could claim a surcharge refund.

Using the lodestar method, the trial court awarded counsel hourly rates of $ 400 and $ 450 per hour. The trial court then applied a 3.8 multiplier. While the trial court correctly used the lodestar method to determine the amount of attorney's fees, it was inappropriate to apply a multiplier because the instant case was neither complex nor uncertain. Once the statute was declared unconstitutional, the attorneys simply had to negotiate the best deal. Additionally, the class attorney admitted in open court that an hourly fee of between $ 400-$ 450 per hour was a more than adequate hourly wage. The trial court, along with every attorney in the courtroom, agreed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentencing court imposed an upward departure sentence of 13 years in state prison, followed by five years on probation, based on its determination that defendant exhibited a flagrant disregard for the safety of others, supported by the fact that: (1) the volume of alcohol in defendant's system was nearly three times the legal limit; and (2) the crime occurred on one of the busiest roadways the county. But, the State conceded that there was no evidence that the intersection was under heavy traffic conditions at the time of the accident and that the extent of intoxication standing alone was an invalid reason to depart because it was already an element of the offense. Accordingly, the trial court's reasons for departing upward from the 1994 guidelines were invalid. The 1996 amendment to the offense severity ranking chart operated as an amendment to the 1994 guidelines. The 1996 legislation, establishing a level 9 severity ranking for the offense of DUI manslaughter with failure to provide information and to render aid, was thus a valid legislative enactment. Hence, defendant should have been sentenced with a scoresheet on which his offense was scored as a level 9 offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was reversed and the case was remanded for the imposition of a guidelines sentence using a corrected scoresheet.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action was originally filed by a computer software company, which challenged a notice of a proposed tax assessment.

The software company voluntarily dismissed its action, leaving the taxpayers as the only parties. The Department then filed its motion for change of venue. The court affirmed the transfer. As the payment of the sales tax was not an &quot;assessment,&quot; the venue provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 72.011(4)(a) did not apply. Therefore, once the software company was no longer in the case, venue in Broward County was not appropriate. Under the &quot;home venue&quot; privilege, the Department had the right to demand venue in Leon County. The &quot;sword wielder&quot; exception to that privilege did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Leon County (Florida) dismissed a complaint filed by plaintiffs, a civil liberties organization and others, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, which alleged the ballot title and summary did not adequately communicate the effect of a proposed amendment to Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 22. Plaintiffs appealed, seeking certification to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to plaintiffs' contention, the instant court first found that a final appealable order had been issued by the circuit court. After considering the proposed amendment regarding parental notice of termination of a minor's pregnancy, it then decided that the issues presented in the appeal were of great public importance or were likely to have a great effect on the proper administration of justice throughout the state. Third, it recognized that on two prior occasions, the Florida Legislature enacted legislation on this subject and both were found to unconstitutionally interfere with a minor's right to privacy. Further, circumstances existed which required that the supreme court immediately resolve the issues, rather than allow the normal appellate process to run its course. Fourth, it found that the apparent intent of the proposed constitutional amendment was to remove this barrier to the legislature's authority to require parental notification when a minor sought termination of a pregnancy. Therefore, the instant litigation presented a question of great public importance to be decided by the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, sought a writ of certiorari to quash an order rendered by the circuit court (Florida) requiring it to issue respondent driver a hardship driver's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department permanently revoked the driver's driving privileges because he had four prior DUI convictions. However, the circuit court granted the driver a hardship license, relying on the 1997 version of Fla. Stat. ch. 322.271. After reviewing the facts in the record, the instant court held that the circuit court erred in doing so. Based on the plain language of the 1997 version of ch. 322.271, it was within the Department's discretion to decide whether to reinstate the license of a driver who met the statutorily specified requirements under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.271(4)(a)-(b). Thus, had the 1997 version of the statute been applicable, the circuit court should have remanded the case for the Department to conduct a hearing to determine whether the driver met said requirements. Moreover, under the 1998 version of the statute, neither the circuit court nor the Department had discretion to issue the hardship license.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) granted the officials' motion for summary judgment and entered a final declaratory judgment. The prisoners appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner's argued that actions taken by the prison officials, which limited access to prison law libraries, violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. These actions included the removal of books, limiting inter-library loan, and restricting hours of operation. The appellate court held that the trial court erred in applying a federal test, which was narrower than the Florida Mitchell test. Section 21 required that the Department of Corrections provide affirmative assistance as to all types of claims that might be filed in Florida's courts, including those based on federal law, not merely those claims challenging convictions, sentences, or conditions of confinement, or seeking to vindicate a fundamental constitutional right. Furthermore, the Department's justification for its action or inaction had to satisfy the strict-scrutiny test when such action or inaction resulted in a significant impediment to inmates' access to the courts. However, the appellate court held that the prisoners were not entitled to relief. As a matter of law, either individually or collectively, the actions complained of did not constitute significant impediments to the right of access to Florida courts.</SPAN></P>

The stay was imposed upon an order entered by the trial court that dismissed a civil commitment petition appellant State had filed against appellee under the Jimmy Ryce Act, Fla. Stat. chs. 394.910-394.931 (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sought dismissal from civil commitment, citing to Atkinson. Upon review, the trial court granted the motion and directed appellee's release. The State filed its notice of appeal and invoked the stay provisions set forth in Rule 9.310. Appellee challenged his continued detention, arguing the automatic stay provisions of Rule 9.310(b) were not applicable to cases involving detention under the Act. The State responded by arguing that Mitchell supported its position that the automatic stay provisions of Rule 9.310(b)(2) were applicable. The appeals court found the dissent's reasoning in Mitchell, that Rule 9.310(b)(2) was never intended to apply to matters involving involuntary civil commitments, to be more persuasive than the majority's position. Due to the appeals court's disagreement with the majority opinion on the issue, it certified conflict with Mitchell, and certified the following question to the Florida Supreme Court as being a matter of great public importance: whether the automatic stay provision set forth in Rule 9.310 applied to civil commitment proceedings instituted under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) that convicted defendant of sexual battery, lewd or lascivious conduct, and burglary of a dwelling with an assault or battery, in violation of Fla. Stat. chs. 794.011(2), 800.04(5)-(7), and 810.02(2)(a), respectively. On appeal, defendant contended his sentences violated double jeopardy protections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At no time during the sentencing hearing did defendant object that his sentences violated double jeopardy principles or that his dual sentence as a habitual offender and prison releasee reoffender were improper. Moreover, defendant did not avail himself of the procedure in Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b) to raise the alleged errors before the trial court. Nonetheless, the legislative intent was clear that separate punishments had to be imposed for each criminal offense created by the statute. Therefore, with respect to defendant's convictions for the separate crimes of lewd or lascivious molestation, lewd or lascivious conduct, and lewd or lascivious exhibition, there was no double jeopardy violation. Specifically, defendant was charged with enticing the victim to touch his penis and was charged with putting his mouth on the victim's breast. Although there was no legislative intent to punish separately each act, there was a sufficient temporal break between the two acts to have allowed defendant to pause, reflect, and form a new criminal intent for each offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order by the Circuit Court of Leon County (Florida) which designated him a sexual predator in accordance with the Florida Sexual Predators Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.21 (2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Florida Sexual Predator Act was unconstitutional in several ways, and argued that the trial court lost jurisdiction to enter the order once 60 days had elapsed after sentencing. The appellate court rejected defendant's contention that the Act violated the separation of powers clause in Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. The appellate court further held that the Act did not violate defendant's right to privacy pursuant to Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. Even if a sexual predator's address could be viewed as non-public information, its dissemination under the Act did not violate the sexual predator's constitutional right to privacy. The appellate court further held that the Act did not violate equal protection requirements merely because it did not apply to offenses which took place before Oct. 1, 1993. It was not a requirement of equal protection that every statutory classification be all-inclusive. The appellate court finally held that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(c) did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to enter the order. That rule plainly dealt with the reduction and modification of sentences, and did not govern a post-sentence designation under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated actions, defendants, the state governor and other state officials, as well as members of the state department of education (governor) appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) which entered a final summary judgment and ruled that the Florida Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), Fla. Stat. ch. 229.0537 (1999), facially violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, various parents of children in Florida elementary and secondary schools and several organizations, filed a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the facial constitutionality of the OSP. The trial court declared Fla. Stat. ch. 229.0537 facially unconstitutional and enjoined the governor from taking any action to implement the OSP. Initially, the vast majority of students participating in the OSP (47 of 51) enrolled in sectarian institutions of learning. Further, the vast majority of the schools receiving state funds from OSP vouchers at the time of the hearing were operated by religious or church groups. As such, for a court to interpret the no-aid provision as adding nothing substantive to Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 would have required that court to ignore the clear meaning of the text of the provision and its formative history. Finally, nothing in the Florida no-aid provision created a constitutional bar to state aid to a non-profit institution that was not sectarian in nature simply because the institution was affiliated with a religious order or religious organization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed, and the question of the constitutionality of a statute was certified for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) that dismissed their complaint with prejudice. The taxpayers contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 196.011(1)(b) violated their right to privacy under various clauses of both the Florida and the United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed a timely application for ad valorem tax exemption. They declined to make the required disclosure of their social security numbers. Their application was denied based on their refusal to make the required disclosure. As such, their property was assessed for that year and in each subsequent year without the homestead exemption. The taxpayers claimed that by reason of the assessment of taxes against the property without the benefit of the homestead tax exemption, they paid higher amounts of property taxes than they would have paid otherwise. In dismissing the claim, the trial court failed to determine whether a compelling state interest-not a legitimate state interest-warranted the intrusion into the taxpayers' privacy. The court should first have determined whether the taxpayers had a legitimate expectation of privacy in their social security numbers without regard to other considerations such as the necessity to submit an application in order to obtain the benefit of the homestead tax exemption. The trial court erred in concluding that the taxpayers had no legitimate expectation of privacy in their social security numbers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded with respect to the taxpayers' state privacy rights claim, and affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>
