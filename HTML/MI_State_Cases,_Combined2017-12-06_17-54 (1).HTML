<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In class actions against defendants, Michigan Public Service Commission, Michigan Department of Treasury, and the State of Michigan, plaintiff trucking companies and intervenor trucking companies claimed that fees collected under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 478.1, .2(1), and .2(2) were unconstitutional and preempted by federal law. After summary disposition was granted to defendants, plaintiffs and intervenors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Michigan Motor Carrier Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 475.1 et seq., required intrastate and interstate motor carriers to pay annual fees. Plaintiffs and intervenors claimed that the fees were preempted by 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11501 and 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11506, now 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 14504, and the &sect; 610(h) of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA) and that the state laws violated Equal Protection and the Commerce Clause. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to defendants. The court held that former 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11506 did not preempt the interstate fee mandated by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 478.2(2) because the fee was a regulatory fee and, therefore, not subject to the federal law. The court also held that &sect; 601 of the FAAAA did not preempt the intrastate fees mandated by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 478.1, .2(1), noting that the pre-1994 federal laws substantively mirrored the former 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11506(c). The fee laws also did not violate the Commerce Clause, finding that there was no showing that the regulatory fee regulated interstate commerce or that the fee was excessive in relation to Michigan's substantial interest in regulating safety on its highways.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer challenged a decision from the Michigan Tax Tribunal, which affirmed respondent township's calculation of the taxable value of the taxpayer's real property for the 2000 tax year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time a residence was appraised in 1999, it was still under construction. Thereafter, the township assessed the property as a &quot;complete new construction.&quot; The taxpayer then filed a petition challenging the valuation. After the tribunal determined that the township properly calculated the value of the residence, the taxpayer sought review. The court determined that the township was precluded from reappraising the entire property in 2000 without regard to the taxable value of the partially completed residence. Mich. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3, as amended by Mich. Proposal A, limited increases on property taxes as long as it was owned by the same party. Therefore, the taxable value was the lesser of the property's taxable value in the immediately preceding year minus any losses, multiplied by the lesser of 1.05 or the inflation rate, plus all additions. There was no exception provided for new construction that was partially completed in one year and fully completed in the subsequent tax year. However, the court noted that the tribunal did not err in denying the taxpayer's request to supplement the record because the evidence was not submitted in a timely manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the tribunal's decision to affirm the township's valuation of the taxpayer's real property. However, the tribunal's decision to deny the taxpayer's request to supplement the record was affirmed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 750.122(3). Subsequently, the State was granted leave to file an amended information charging a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.122(6). The State appealed from a judgment of the Washtenaw Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted defendant's motion to quash the amended information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an adjournment of preliminary proceedings on defendant's charge of killing his girlfriend's unborn quick child, defendant violated the district court's order not to have contact with the girlfriend. During phone calls, defendant asked the girlfriend not to come to the preliminary hearing when it resumed and offered suggestions of where to hide. The girlfriend did appear and admitted to the conversations with defendant. At the close of proofs, the State was permitted to amend its information to conform to the proofs and charge defendant under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.122(6). The circuit court granted defendant's motion to quash the amended information. The State appealed, and the court reversed the judgment. The court held that &sect; 750.122(6) made illegal any act or attempt to keep a witness from attending, testifying, or providing information in or for a present or future official proceeding by affecting the witness's ability to do so. The court also held that the district court properly bound defendant over. The evidence presented would have allowed a reasonable person to infer that defendant willfully attempted to interfere with his girlfriend's attendance at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff personal representative sued a hospital for medical malpractice and wrongful death. The hospital settled the case for $ 460,000; $ 220,000 was allocated to the wrongful death and $ 240,000 for decedent's pain and suffering. The personal representative then sued defendant nursing home for the same wrongful death in the Branch Circuit Court (Michigan). The jury awarded $ 300,000 in total wrongful death damages. The nursing home appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nursing home maintained that the judgment should have been reduced to reflect the personal representative's earlier settlement with the hospital. The appellate court found that the hospital and the nursing home were jointly and severally liable for decedent's wrongful death and that the common-law rule of setoff was applicable. Thus, the appellate court concluded that the $ 300,000 verdict would be reduced by the $ 220,000 settlement payment made by the hospital to the personal representative with regard to wrongful death. The hospital and nursing home through successive negligent acts, produced a single, indivisible injury, i.e., the death of the decedent and thus were jointly and severally liable for wrongful death. The appellate court found that comprehensive tort reform legislation was silent on the issue of common-law setoff. Therefore, the appellate court determined that the legislature intended that the principle of one recovery and the common-law rule of setoff, in the context of joint and several liability cases, would remain intact after the amendment of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2925d. Pursuant to the setoff, the appellate court reduced the judgment to $ 80,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed and reduced the amount of the judgment to $ 80,000 and the amount of prejudgment interest on the entire amount accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Livingston Circuit Court, Michigan, entered judgment declaring appellant property owner's zoning referendum petition invalid and enjoined the requisite certification of the petition in favor of appellees, township and landowners. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that the township board did not comply with the Township Rural Zoning Act (TZRA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.281 et seq., when it signed the consent judgment permitting the landowner to build the mobile home park, and that township residents had the right of referendum on the zoning issue. The appellate court found that the statutory language indicated that the right of referendum was applicable to zoning ordinances only. The TRZA set forth formal provisions for the enactment of an ordinance by the appropriate boards and governing bodies. The consent judgment did not comport with the particularized requirements of a zoning ordinance or amendment. Accordingly, the consent judgment was neither the promulgation of a zoning ordinance nor an amendment to a zoning ordinance, as contemplated by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.282. The owner could not effectively contest the action of the township by a referendum election. A variance was distinct from an ordinance or an amendment to an ordinance as contemplated by the TRZA. The simple act of publishing a notice of adoption of a consent judgment failed to transform the judgment into a zoning ordinance, as contemplated by the TRZA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff purchaser challenged a decision of the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan), which denied his motion for summary disposition and granted the same as to defendants, State, Department of Treasury (DOT) (Michigan), Department of Natural Resources (DNR) (Michigan), and property owner, in connection with the purchaser's quiet title action. The trial court found that the purchaser's action was time barred under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.431.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city issued a quitclaim deed to an individual, but the property was later sold to the State for the nonpayment of taxes. The individual passed away during the redemption period, and thereafter the DOT issued a quitclaim deed to the State. After the next redemption period, the State recorded its deed and the DNR sold the property to the owner. Prior to this, the personal representative of the individual's estate sold the property in question to the purchaser, who then filed this quiet title action. Although the State admitted that it failed to give the purchaser notice as required by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.131e, the trial court dismissed the action as time-barred. The court reversed and agreed that the purchaser was entitled to a right of redemption pursuant to the provisions of the Michigan General Property Tax Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.1 et seq. The court found that notice under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.131e was required before a party's right to redemption expired. Because the redemption period was extended until 30 days after a show cause hearing, and the show cause hearing in this case was never noticed, the property in question was still subject to redemption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Michigan Department of Community Health (DHC) challenged a decision from the Ingham Circuit Court (Michigan), which issued a preliminary injunction in favor of plaintiff pharmaceutical group that prohibited the implementation of a prescription drug rebate and preauthorization policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DHC announced a decision to implement a policy expanding a rebate requirement to all state funded programs. Under the new policy, preauthorization was required before the cost of certain medications were reimbursed by the state. The preauthorization was waived if a drug manufacturer agreed to pay a &quot;supplemental&quot; rebate in addition to those under the Medicaid program. The group filed an action against the DHC seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. After the trial court issued a preliminary injunction and determined that 2001 Mich. Pub. Acts 60, &sect; 2204 was unconstitutional, the DHC sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction because the group was not likely to prevail on the merits of the case. Under the Social Welfare Act, the DCH was responsible for establishing and administering medical assistance programs in Michigan. As such, the DCH had broad authority over both Medicaid and non-Medicaid programs. Under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 400.109(1)(d), 400.111a(3)(d), and other relevant statutes, the DCH had the authority to require preauthorization and to implement reimbursement policies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of resisting and obstructing a police officer in the Sheboygan Circuit Court (Michigan). Defendant appealed, arguing that the lawful arrest element of resisting and obstructing was not satisfied, because his arrest was unlawful based on the unconstitutionality of a disorderly conduct ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been drinking and when one of the friends urinated on a wall, an officer instructed the group to move on. At this point, defendant became boisterous and began yelling and screaming obscenities at the officer, which could be heard a block away. Another officer arrived, and defendant and others assaulted both officers, as they attempted to arrest defendant. Specifically, defendant contended that he was justified in resisting arrest, because he was arrested pursuant to a city ordinance that was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. At the time of the arrest, the disorderly conduct ordinance had not been held unconstitutional nor had it been since the time of the arrest. The underlying issue was whether an arrest was unlawful if it was made pursuant to an ordinance that was subsequently found unconstitutional. The appellate court noted a United States Supreme Court decision in which the answer was clearly negative. The appellate court held that the validity of an arrest was not affected by the subsequent judicial determination that an ordinance was unconstitutional. Because defendant's arrest was lawful, he was not permitted to use reasonable force to resist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a conditional plea of no contest to causing public disorder. Defendant's appeal to the Shiawassee Circuit Court (Michigan) was denied. The instant court denied defendant's application for leave to appeal. Subsequently, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, the Michigan Supreme Court remanded the case to the instant court for consideration as on leave granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stood, on city property, approximately 30 feet from the front of a dentist's office (the dentist allegedly supported abortion rights), and approximately 300 feet away from a church which allegedly supported family planning. As mothers were dropping off their children at the day care operated by the church, defendant yelled, &quot;They kill babies in that church. Why are you going in there?&quot; The issue on appeal was the constitutionality of Owosso, Mich. City Code &sect; 19-82 relating to public disorder. The appellate court held the ordinance made no content-based distinctions and was narrowly drawn and limited to define and punish only &quot;fighting words.&quot; On its face, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally overbroad. However, defendant's words had no tendency to incite an imminent breach of the peace. The children's mere fright, though an unfortunate consequence of defendant's speech, did not rise to the level of violence or a disturbance of public order, nor was such a result likely. Therefore, based on the limited facts of the case, the appellate court held that the ordinance was unconstitutionally applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan) convicting him of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in violation of MCL 750.520b, felonious assault in violation of MCL 750.82, assault with intent to commit great bodily harm in violation of MCL 750.84, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony in violation of MCL 750.227b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for attacking and sexually assaulting the victim, his estranged wife, while possessing a gun. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not denied his right to represent himself at trial because the judge at the preliminary examination was only required to comply with MCR 6.005(E), as defendant had previously been allowed to represent himself at an earlier hearing before another judge and standby counsel had been appointed to assist defendant. At the time of the pretrial conference, defendant informed the court that he wished to proceed with counsel, thereby waiving his right to self-representation at trial. The court rejected defendant's claim that reversal was required because his arraignment on the warrant was unreasonably delayed beyond 48 hours after his arrest because there were some indications that any delay was necessitated by medical problems that defendant was experiencing and because defendant did not show that any delay affected the fairness of the proceedings. Because defendant consented to the arresting officer's entry into his home, the officer could properly enter the home and arrest him without a warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant doctors appealed as of right from a judgment entered in the Oakland Circuit Court, Michigan, for plaintiff patient in a medical malpractice case. The patient cross-appealed the trial court's decision to reduce the damages awarded by the jury pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.1483.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following surgery for a cancerous thyroid tumor, the patient had difficulty breathing, swallowing, and eating. She brought a medical malpractice action alleging the surgeon, the hospital, and its agents were negligent. The patient was awarded damages by the jury. On a post-trial motion, the patient asked the trial court to hold that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.1483, the statute that placed a cap on noneconomic damages, violated her right to a jury trial, her right to equal protection, and the separation of powers clause. The appellate court upheld &sect; 600.1483. The limitations of the statute did not impede the patient's ability to present her case to the jury nor the jury's ability to determine the extent of her damages. The statute withstood the equal protection challenge, because it was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose of controlling health care costs. There was no separation of powers violation; since the statute was substantive, rather than procedural, it did not infringe on the court's rule-making authority.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the action involved the alleged liability of the commission under the highway exception to governmental immunity, Mich. Comp.

The court held that the decisive question was whether applying &sect; 257.710e(6) to the liability of governmental units for defective highways resulted in that section exceeding the scope of the title to the vehicle code. The court stated that the clear language of &sect; 257.710e(6) only required that plaintiffs suffered damages arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle, as alleged in the present case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor negotiated compacts with four Indian tribes to permit class III gaming by the tribes on eligible Indian lands in Michigan. The approval of the compacts was submitted to the Michigan Legislature through the joint resolution process that only required a majority of voting members. The legislature approved the compacts. The tribes adopted state law in some regulatory and revenue aspects, but the compacts did not provide the State with any authority to enforce the provisions. The appellate court determined that the governor had authority to negotiate with the tribes, and the appellate court could not conclude that the actions were ultra vires. As to whether the submission of the compacts for approval through the joint resolution process instead of through the legislative process violated three constitutional provisions, the State could not prohibit Indian tribal gaming, and federal law dictated that the State negotiate the compacts with the tribes. The resolution process was a sufficient methodology for approval of compacts. The taxpayers failed to meet their burden of proof to establish a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's conclusion that the resolution approval of the compacts was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the approval did not violate other constitution provisions, albeit on other grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff originally sought a tax refund before the Tax Tribunal. It was a matter over which the Tax Tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction. The constitutional question was brought in circuit court because the Tax Tribunal had no jurisdiction to consider it. The circuit court did not have ancillary jurisdiction to order plaintiff's tax refund. Because the Tax Tribunal was bound by the decision of the state Supreme Court which found Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.34d(1)(b)(vii)&nbsp;unconstitutional, the Tax Tribunal had to determine the amount of refund due plaintiff. There were no further matters for the circuit court upon which the determination of a refund was dependent. Therefore, the circuit court properly concluded it did not have jurisdiction to consider the refund issue; consideration of the issue of plaintiff's refund was for the Tax Tribunal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to prison and ordered to pay $ 454,125 in restitution. On appeal, defendant claimed the statutes that concerned the legality of horse race wagering, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 431.317(1), 431.329, were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that they violated the doctrine of separation of powers. The appellate court found defendant's constitutional challenges to be without merit. The statutes were not an improper delegation of power to an administrative agency.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was overheard referring to fellow restaurant patrons as &quot;spics.&quot; Manistee City, Mich., Ordinance 662.01(B)(3) provided the following: No person shall engage in any indecent, insulting, immoral, or obscene conduct in any public place. The appellate court ruled that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague on its face, because limiting the application of the ordinance to &quot;fighting words&quot; provided fair notice of the constitutionally proscribable conduct and was sufficiently definite to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. However, the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. Defendant was charged under the &quot;insulting&quot; term of the ordinance, and, without fair warning, she was charged with and convicted for conduct that she could not reasonably have known was criminal. The term &quot;insulting&quot; with regard to prohibited conduct did not give adequate forewarning that the challenged conduct, referencing a person by a racial slur, could rise to the level of constitutionally proscribable &quot;fighting words&quot; conduct.</SPAN></P>

The case was remanded for the appellate court to consider whether the remarks that formed the basis for the sexual harassment verdict constituted constitutionally-protected speech and whether the liability imposed under the Michigan civil rights act, Mich.

Defendant argued insufficient evidence existed to support the second-degree murder conviction. The conviction was affirmed as the evidence showed that defendant was seriously intoxicated when he drove and knew that he might experience a black-out and drive irresponsibly. The State was not required to prove that defendant was subjectively aware of the risk that his conduct created as doing so would mean that moderately intoxicated drivers could be convicted of second-degree murder while severely intoxicated drivers would be excused as they were too intoxicated to know better. Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective for not presenting an involuntary intoxication defense as there was no evidence that not presenting the defense was objectively unreasonable or would have resulted in an acquittal. Defendant's due process rights were not violated by being convicted of second-degree murder and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor causing death as the two crimes contained elements that were not found in the other. Defendant's prior drunk driving arrest was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, various municipal entities, assessed certain personal property of appellant, the corporation. The corporation sought to appeal the assessments to the Michigan Tax Tribunal, which entered orders of dismissal in each case. The corporation's motion for reconsideration was denied. The corporation appealed, and the appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipal entities assessed the corporation's personal property that it believed was in excess of the true cash value. The corporation attempted to appeal the assessments and mailed its tax appeal petitions on June 30, 1999, by first-class mail. The tax tribunal received the petitions and filing fees on July 2, 1999. The tax tribunal found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the appeals. The tax tribunal found that the petitions were not timely filed, because the petitions were not received by June 30 or mailed by certified mail and postmarked on or before June 30, as required by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.735. The corporation challenged the orders. The court of appeals held that: (1) the tax tribunal did not err in dismissing the petitions for lack of jurisdiction; (2) the tax tribunal did not fail to exercise its discretion by denying the motion for reconsideration; (3) &sect; 205.735 did not violate the Due Process Clauses of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17; and (4)&nbsp;&sect; 205.735 was not an unreasonable classification under the Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the city maintained that the proper public purpose of the project was to minimize a public hazard for individuals traveling on an avenue when traffic exited the facilities of two private companies onto a single, shared access to the public road. Because the proposed road would be a public road and would aid traffic congestion problems, there was concrete proof that the condemnation was primarily for the public's benefit, and, thus, the proposed taking was constitutional. The appellate court found that the city did not demonstrate that the public was primarily to be benefited from the construction of the proposed road. Rather, it benefitted the private companies. The trial court correctly applied heightened scrutiny in finding the public benefit was not clear and significant; rather, it was speculative and marginal. The fact that the proposed road was to be a public road did not, standing alone, automatically mean that the public purpose/public use would be advanced by its construction. Accordingly, the taking was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant challenged a decision of the Emmet Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted summary disposition to appellee prosecuting attorney in connection with the civil forfeiture case against him filed pursuant to Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney filed the civil forfeiture proceeding against the claimant after 17 pounds of marijuana was found in his home, for which he was later convicted on criminal charges. The trial court granted the attorney's motion for summary disposition, and the court affirmed. The court agreed with the trial court that there was a substantial connection between the home and the drug activity. An affiant stated that he purchased drugs from the claimant for years, and the house was the site of many of the transactions. The court rejected the claimant's argument that the forfeiture constituted an excessive fine in violation of the Excessive Fines Clause, Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. Given the amount of drugs found, the value of the home and drugs, and the harm to society by the claimant's actions, there was no unconstitutionally excessive fine. The trial court did not err in refusing to exempt his home from forfeiture under Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.6023 because the statute allowing for forfeiture in this case, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7521, did not provide for a homestead exemption, and such an exemption would not have been properly applied under these circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several challengers commenced an action challenging the constitutionality of Act 90 of the Public Acts of Michigan 2002 (PA 90), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 259.108 - 259.125c. The challengers objected to PA 90's transfer of operational jurisdiction of two airports from Wayne County, Michigan, to a statutorily-created airport authority. The Wayne County Treasurer filed a cross-complaint, seeking a declaration regarding the procedures for the transfer of money and assets, pursuant to PA 90. The court directed the parties to file cross-motions for summary disposition. The court concluded that the challenger's claim regarding PA 90's requirement that a county continue to employ airport employees who chose not to transfer to the airport authority was not ripe for adjudication. With regard to the challenger's claim that the employee pensions constituted an unfunded new activity, under PA 90, &sect; 117(1)(d), the airport authority assumed, and was responsible for paying for, the pensions. The challengers failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that PA 90 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary disposition was granted in favor of the defendant. Plaintiffs claims were dismissed with prejudice, except for the claim relating to transferring employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to the passenger's complaint, she was a passenger on a bus owned by defendant transportation authority and driven by defendant bus driver. The bus driver and defendant other driver began driving erratically, and as a result the bus was forced to come to a sudden and abrupt stop. The passenger was injured during the stop. The transportation authority and the bus driver moved for summary disposition, asserting that the passenger failed to comply with the 60-day notice provision of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 124.419 for parties asserting claims against transportation authorities, which the circuit court granted. The appellate court found that the no-fault act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3101 et seq., contemplated that the transportation authority, as owner of the bus, would maintain insurance or be held to all of the obligations of an insurer, including to pay PIP claims that were valid and timely under the no-fault act. Thus, the notice provisions of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 124.419 were inapplicable to the statutory no-fault claim for first-party PIP benefits. Additionally, the circuit court erred in ruling that actual prejudice was not required under &sect; 124.419.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were married. The husband resided in Illinois and the wife resided in Michigan. It was undisputed that the wife's Michigan home was her continuous principal residence, and she operated a business from there. The taxpayers jointly filed Michigan income tax returns as nonresidents, and used the husband's Illinois address as their return address. In addition the taxpayers claimed a property tax credit on their income taxes for the Illinois home on their resident Illinois State income tax returns. The appellate court found that: (1) the Michigan homestead exemption's plain language simply did not prohibit both a Michigan property tax homestead exemption for a Michigan home and a simultaneous Illinois homestead income tax credit for a separate Illinois home; (2) the tax tribunal's factual finding that the taxpayers claimed two homestead exemptions in two States was erroneous because one was a credit and the other was an exemption; and (3) thus, the tax tribunal's judgment resulted from an error of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with 12 counts of encumbering property with the intent to harass or intimidate, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2907a(2). The Washentaw Circuit Court (Michigan) held the statute was unconstitutional and granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2907a(2) provided a penalty for violating Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 565.25, a statutory provision that was not part of the Reformed Judicature Act of 1961(RJA), and, therefore, violated the Title-Object Clause, Mich. Const. art 4, &sect; 24 (1963). Although Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 565.25 supplemented Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2907a by providing additional detail regarding the entry of liens, the appellate court believed that the proscribing language of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2907a(2) was sufficient to qualify as a freestanding provision of the RJA. Because the proscribed conduct constituted an abuse of the judicial system, providing penalties for an abuse of that system was a subject sufficiently related to the purpose of the RJA. The appellate court was not persuaded that the subject of the provision and the subject of the act were diverse enough to raise concerns about fair notice. Defendant also made a change of purpose challenge to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2907a. The appellate court concluded that the subject matter of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2907a(2) was germane to the subject matter of the RJA's original purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representative claimed that the hospital was liable for certain physicians' negligent treatment of the decedent. The hospital argued that the affidavit of merit did not comply with Mich. Comp.

The trial court dismissed the action. The appellate court noted that the purpose of &sect; 600.2169(1) was to make sure that experts had practical expertise in the subject matter about which they testified. The appellate court rejected the representative's argument that the health care professional did not need to be certified like the physicians because the physicians were not parties to the action. The representative alleged vicarious liability on the part of the hospital, and the hospital could not be held liable unless the physicians were. It was immaterial that the representative's attorney believed that the affidavit of merit complied with Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.2912d(I) because at the time the amended complaint was filed, the constitutionality of Mich. Comp. Laws. Ann. &sect; 600.2169(1) was established.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally charged with carrying a concealed weapon and possession of marijuana. The prosecution moved the Genessee Circuit Court (Michigan) to remand the case to the district court in order to add charges of felon in possession of a firearm and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. The prosecution also moved to dismiss the case without prejudice. The trial court denied both motions. The prosecution appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution argued that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the motions. The appellate court agreed. The appellate court concluded that defendant was not prejudiced by the addition of the charges for felony-firearm and felon in possession of a firearm as the prosecution had informed the trial court of its intention to amend the information prior to defendant's refusal of the prosecution's plea offer. Defendant would have had sufficient preparation time for the additional charges, given the direct relationship of the additional charges to the original charge of carrying a concealed weapon. Further, defense counsel certainly had knowledge of this direct relation. The appellate court concluded that there was no evidence of prosecutorial vindictiveness to support the trial court's decision. Defendant did not affirmatively demonstrate actual prejudice on behalf of the prosecution. The facts of the case did not rise to actual vindictiveness. In regard to the prosecution's motion to dismiss without prejudice, the appellate court noted it was well within the prosecution's discretion to proceed to trial or to dismiss the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, personal representative of the estate of decedent, sued appellant rental car company on the basis of statutory liability and obtained a favorable verdict. The Saginaw Circuit Court (Michigan) held the cap on recoverable damages in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 401(3) was unconstitutional because it violated the right to a jury trial, equal protection, and due process clauses under the Michigan Constitution. The rental car company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The personal representative sought entry of judgment for $ 250,000, plus statutory interest, fees, and costs, while the rental car company sought entry of judgment for $ 20,000, pursuant to a lessor's liability limit under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.401(3). The circuit court, finding &sect; 257.401(3)&nbsp;unconstitutional, entered judgment in the amount of $ 250,000. The appellate court held: (1) the damages cap in &sect; 401(3) in no way removed from the jury the determination of facts and of the amount of damages that the injured person incurred, but simply limited the amount of damages that could be recovered from a lessor of vehicles and did not violate the right to trial by jury under Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 14; (2) because &sect; 401(3) was rationally related to a legitimate government purpose of protecting automobile rental businesses from large damage awards, it survived rational basis review and did not violate equal protection under Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 2; and (3) because the test to determine whether legislation passed constitutional muster under the due process and equal protection clauses was essentially the same, &sect; 401(3) did not violate due process under Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was reversed and the case was remanded for entry of judgment consistent with the appellate court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, patient and related individual, brought a medical malpractice action against defendant physicians. The Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan) dismissed the action without prejudice and found that plaintiffs' affidavit filed in connection with their complaint did not comply with Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.2912d. Certain physicians appealed as of right from the trial court's order, and plaintiffs also challenged the dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 600.2912d required plaintiffs to file an affidavit of merit with their complaint. The trial court found that the affidavit did not comply with statutory requirements because it was not signed by a qualified expert witness who was a board certified neurologist. The trial court dismissed the action. On appeal, plaintiffs argued that the dismissal of their action was error, because their attorney reasonably believed that the affidavit of merit was signed by a qualified expert. This belief was based upon the court's previous decision in another case that held Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.2169 to be unconstitutional. Plaintiffs contended that, in light of this opinion, their attorney was correct in believing that the expert witness was qualified under Mich. R. Evid. 702. The court rejected this argument and noted that it's previous opinion, which was reversed on appeal, had nothing to do with Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.2192d. The court found that, as a sanction for not complying with the statute, dismissal without prejudice was appropriate, because the more drastic remedy of dismissal with prejudice for failure to comply was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal without prejudice of plaintiffs' medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520c was unconstitutional since it improperly shifted the burden of proof to her to rebut a presumption that a particular touch could be reasonably construed as being for the purpose of sexual gratification or arousal. The appellate court ruled that the statute merely required the State to establish an intentional contact that could reasonably be construed as being for a sexual purpose and did not shift the burden of proof. Defendant also argued that the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 28.721 et seq., unconstitutionally deprived her of liberty interests without due process of law and deprived her of her constitutional right to privacy. The appellate court ruled that the requirements of SORA were not an unconstitutional infringement of defendant's protected liberty, property or privacy interests and that the State was not required to engage in due process beyond that afforded in defendant's juvenile court proceedings before including information about her in the public database of registered sex offenders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases arising from a dispute regarding the water level of a lake, an impoundment of water created following the construction of a dam, plaintiff, a property owner, alleged that defendants conspired to operate a spillway in a manner calculated to maintain the lake at a level detrimental to his property. The Genesee Circuit Court, Michigan, granted defendants' motion for summary disposition. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that: (1) the trial court erred in granting summary disposition because defendants did not comply with the notice requirements of Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(B)(2); (2) the death of one of the defendants abated the trial court's jurisdiction over the matter and rendered all judgments entered thereafter void; (3) he was entitled to have the judgments entered on the mediation awards set aside on the ground of fraud; (4) the trial court erred in denying his motion for relief from judgment without first conducting an evidentiary hearing; (5) the trial court erred in dismissing his claims in two of the dockets on the basis of res judicata; and (6) the trial court erred in granting defendants attorney fees, costs, and sanctions. The instant court rejected plaintiff's arguments. Although defendants violated the notice requirements, summary disposition was proper. No prejudice to plaintiff resulted from defendants' untimely filing of their motions for summary disposition, and any error was harmless. Even assuming that the action abated as to the deceased defendant, that defendant's death had no effect on the trial court's ability to act with respect to the remaining defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retired judges appealed the order of the Ingham Circuit Court (Michigan) granting summary disposition to defendant state, finding that the treatment accorded by statute to judges of the 36th District Court with regard to retirement benefits did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retired judges served out state rather than in the 36th District Court in Detroit. The 36th District Court judges were entitled to a retirement benefit calculated on a compensation level, including both the salary paid to them by the State and the salary paid to them by the district control unit. Other district court judges were paid a retirement benefit based on compensation, including only the salary paid by the state. The trial court reasoned that, as some out state judges could receive equal or better total retirement benefit treatment than 36th District Court judges, the equal protection challenge failed. The appellate court ruled that the trial court erroneously determined that the statutory scheme did not violate equal protection. It did not matter that some out state judges might, depending on the largess of their local funding units, receive a total retirement benefit equal to or better than that afforded to the 36th District Court judges. What mattered was that the out state district court judge retirees did not receive the same statutorily guaranteed benefit as did 36th District Court judge retirees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, taxpayers, school districts, and intermediate school districts, sued defendant Michigan Department of Education, Michigan Department of Management and Budget, and the Michigan Treasurer, seeking a judgment declaring that the state underfunded its obligation under the Headlee Amendment, Mich. Const. art 9, &sect; 29; a declaration that 2000 Mich. Pub. Acts 297 was unconstitutional; and a money judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Proposal A, Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 11, the state had to fund schools at the minimum level provided in 1994-95. Under the Headlee Amendment, it also had to fund special education. Under 2000 Mich. Pub. Acts 297, the funds that composed the difference between the 1994-95 foundation allowance and the basic foundation allowances referred to in 2000 Mich. Pub. Acts 297 &sect; 20(1), other than the Headlee obligation allocation, went into the discretionary funds &quot;bucket.&quot; Plaintiffs argued that money allocated to the &quot;foundation allowance&quot; was unavailable to satisfy the state's obligations under the Headlee Amendment, even if that foundation allowance was greater that the minimum required under Proposal A. The instant court disagreed. Funds allocated to the &quot;foundation allowance&quot; could be used to meet the State's obligations under both Proposal A and the Headlee Amendment so long as the foundation allowance was at least equal to the sum of its obligations under Proposal A and the Headlee Amendment. The fact that each school district might receive the same amount of funding under the Act that it received under earlier laws was immaterial to the funding scheme's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state initiated an administrative proceeding against defendant corporation for violation of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act (MCFA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 169.201 et. seq. An administrative hearing officer found that the corporation had violated the MCFA. The corporation appealed to the Ingham Circuit Court, Michigan, which vacated the hearing officer's decision. The state sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence presented before the hearing officer unquestionably established that the corporation sold political polling services to a political action committee and did not actively seek payment for its services rendered. The point of contention on appeal was the alleged vagueness of the word &quot;forbearance&quot; as used in Michigan Campaign Finance Act (MCFA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 169.201 et. seq. The appellate court found that: (1) the term &quot;forbearance&quot; as used in the MCFA was not unconstitutionally vague, (2) the circuit court's conclusion that the state's failure to promulgate or adopt a rule further defining &quot;forbearance&quot; precluded enforcement on the basis of illegal forbearance was rejected because no further definition was necessary, (3) the MCFA's use of the word forbearance was sufficiently precise even under the heightened scrutiny required for restrictions on political expression, (4) the corporation failed to demonstrate arbitrary enforcement, and (5) the hearing officer's decision failed to make any findings of fact as to the purpose of the corporation's forbearance, thus the matter was remanded to the administrative agency for further findings of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was reversed. The judgment of the administrative agency was affirmed except for the conclusion that the corporation violated the campaign finance act was violated, and the matter was remanded to the circuit court with directions to remand to the hearing officer for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed by leave a judgment of the Arenac Circuit Court, Michigan, which affirmed defendant's misdemeanor conviction in district court for using indecent and vulgar language, contrary to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.337.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A father was canoeing down a river with his family approximately 40 yards behind defendant's canoeing party. The father testified he saw defendant fall out of his canoe and into the river, at which point defendant loudly uttered a stream of profanities, while slapping the water and throwing his hands in the air. A sheriff's deputy testified he heard a &quot;loud commotion&quot; and &quot;vulgar language&quot; coming from approximately one-quarter mile up the river. Both witnesses testified that the river was crowded with families and children and that defendant would have been able to see the father's two children, who were under five years old. Defendant argued his conviction had to be reversed, as &sect; 750.337 was facially unconstitutional on overbreadth and vagueness grounds. The instant court held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, because it failed to provide fair notice of what conduct was prohibited, and it encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. There was no restrictive language contained in the statute that would have limited or guided a prosecution for indecent, immoral, obscene, vulgar, or insulting language. The statute impinged on First Amendment freedoms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several taxpayers filed complaints alleging that the taxable values of their properties were of percentages of true cash value greater than the average percentage of all other properties taxed in the township. The taxpayers further alleged that because Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 3 (1963), required uniformity in taxation, the township's method of real property taxation violated the state constitution. The trial courts concluded that the taxpayers' arguments were without merit. On review, the court of appeals agreed. Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 3 was amended by Mich. Proposal A (1994). By accepting Proposal A, the electorate provided for a cap on real property tax assessments. After Proposal A, taxes were levied according to a property's taxable value, and because a property's taxable value was contingent on whether its owner retained or sold it, the percentages of taxable value to true cash value among identical pieces of property would not be uniform.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed by leave granted by the order of the Washtenaw Circuit Court, Michigan, which modified a &quot;no contact&quot; provision of a personal protection order and allowed defendant parenting time with his minor children. Defendant also appealed as of right the order of the trial court, which found defendant in criminal contempt for violating the personal protection order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it entered a personal protection order (PPO) prohibiting defendant from contacting his children. Defendant also argued that the trial court had no statutory authority to modify the PPO to include parenting time. Essentially, defendant argued that these custody and parenting time determinations could only be made in a child custody proceeding. In an effort to support his argument, defendant cited the Child Custody Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.21 et seq. The appellate court rejected his arguments. Allowing a trial court to issue orders regarding custody and parenting time in a PPO proceeding did not cause an administrative nightmare. Defendant was not denied the right of allocution before he was sentenced for the contempt offense. Sufficient evidence supported the finding that defendant was guilty of contempt, because defendant's actions violated the prohibition against sending communications to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

After the driver of the vehicle was given a breathalyzer test that indicated the driver consumed alcohol, the police officers tested defendant, who also tested positive for alcohol consumption. The court found that defendant drank legally in Canada, but determined that defendant violated Mich. Comp. Laws Serv. &sect; 436.1703(1) because he possessed alcohol in Michigan by having it in his body. The appellate court noted no matter how closely an act was connected with the state, if all the criminal elements were done entirely outside a state's boundaries, it could not be punished by that state. The terms &quot;consume&quot; and &quot;possess&quot; were held to be ambiguous as used in the &quot;minor in possession&quot; statute, as they could be interpreted in more than one way. In order to violate the minor in possession statute, defendant had to consume or possess alcoholic liquor. The court held that once a person ingested liquor, it was no longer &quot;fit for use for beverage purposes,&quot; in accordance with Mich. Comp. Laws Serv. &sect; 436.1105(2). As defendant sat as a passenger in the car in Michigan, he did not consume or possess &quot;alcoholic liquor.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that the circuit court erred in treating the company's complaint as an administrative appeal and, as a result similarly erred by applying an incorrect standard of review and granting summary disposition on a record limited to the proofs presented by plaintiff at the lower tribunals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer, challenging a property tax assessment, filed suit challenging the constitutionality of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.10, which froze 1992 property tax assessments at their 1991 levels while adjusting to reflect additions and losses to property. The appellees, city and county, filed for summary disposition. The Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan) granted the city and county's motion and dismissed the case. The developer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In granting summary disposition to the city and county, the trial court held that the developer failed to rebut the presumption of constitutionality surrounding the statute. On appeal, the developer argued that the statute violated the requirement of uniformity found in Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 3 (1963) in the assessment of ad valorem property taxes, and therefore equal protection considerations did not apply. The appellate court found the statute constitutional. The court first found that there was no discernable difference between the uniformity clause and equal protection, therefore, an equal protection analysis was appropriate to determine the uniformity of ad valorem property tax assessments. The court held that the statute provided equal treatment and uniform taxation for similarly situated property owners. The statute's exemption provision operated on different classes of property and was based on real differences that reasonably suggested the necessity of different treatment. There was a rational basis for distinguishing between property taxpayers who made no changes to their property and whose property was affected by additions, losses, splits, and combinations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On its own motion, appellee public service commission issued orders, pursuant to the Customer Choice and Electricity Reliability Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 460.10 et seq., dismissing a power company's application for a power supply cost reconciliation and an application to implement a power supply cost recovery (PSCR) plan. Both orders were appealed by several parties, including appellant state attorney general. The appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power company's pending applications that were dismissed by the commission were properly construed as being temporarily supplanted by the act, which froze residential and non-residential electric rates until December 31, 2003. The commission properly exercised its discretion to suspend implementation of the PSCR clause that would have had the effect of adjusting electric rates, in direct contravention of the freeze. The attorney general and other appellants argued that the dismissal of the pending PSCR proceedings illegally cut off the power company's customers' rights to millions of dollars of refunds they were entitled to. The appellate court disagreed and found that the rights had not yet vested, as the commission had not entered an order mandating a refund of the specified amounts. Before asserting an uncompensated taking, a claimant had to first establish that a vested property right was affected. Without this, there was no right to a refund. The commission's statutory construction properly gave effect to the rate freeze and other statutory provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of an order of the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan) which granted grandparent visitation in favor of appellee paternal grandmother. The mother's sole argument on appeal was that the Michigan Grandparenting Time statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.27b, was unconstitutional and, therefore, the paternal grandmother's petition should have been denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and father had been divorced after the father admitted to abusing the mother's daughter, who was the father's stepdaughter. The couple also had one child in common who was the subject of the petition. The mother had sole legal and physical custody of the child. The paternal grandmother had petitioned for visitation with the child. The mother opposed the request, citing the paternal grandmother's denial of her son's abuse of the other daughter. The trial court opined it thought grandmothers were important. The appellate court held the fact that the Michigan statute limited itself to allowing only grandparents under certain conditions to petition for visitation was not sufficient to avoid constitutional problems. The lack of any standards in the Michigan statute beyond &quot;the best interest of the child,&quot; and specifically the failure of the statute to afford any deference to the custodial parent's decision, rendered it unconstitutional as written since fit parents were presumed to act in the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held the grandparent visitation statute was unconstitutional. Since the trial court lacked the authority to grant relief to the paternal grandparent, a remand was unnecessary. Rather, the appellate court vacated the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court answered &quot;no.&quot; The sheriff's appointment of employees of a religiously affiliated college as deputy sheriffs with full arrest powers extending to violations of state law on public streets did not offend the establishment of religion clauses of the United States or Michigan Constitutions. Although the sheriff retained the statutory authority to unilaterally fire the college officers at will, there was no active involvement between the religious college and the sheriff's department.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court held that defendants' conduct did not occur in a public place as a matter of law within the meaning of the statute prohibiting gross indecency between males, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.338, and affirmed the dismissal of the charges against defendants. The Michigan Supreme Court vacated this holding and remanded the case to the instant court to address whether defendants' acts were grossly indecent within the meaning of &sect; 750.338.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A store detective entered a restroom and noticed that both of the two adjoining stalls were occupied. After the detective washed his hands, he walked out of the restroom and waited for several minutes. When nobody exited the restroom during that time, the detective and a supervisor entered the restroom. The detective kneeled down and lowered his head so he could see under the stall doors. The detective observed that the occupant of the handicapped stall, the first defendant, was down on his knees, facing the adjacent stall, with his pants and underwear around his ankles. The occupant of the adjacent stall, the second defendant, was sitting on the toilet. The second defendant was moving his arm up and down near the bottom of the handicapped stall where the first defendant was kneeling. The detective did not actually see defendants touching each other and did not see either defendant's penis. The instant court concluded that, if the facts as alleged by the State were true, then defendants' conduct constituted an act of gross indecency. The instant court also directed the trial court on remand to modify a standard jury instruction to comport with the alleged act of masturbation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision dismissing the gross indecency charges was reversed, and the case was remanded further proceedings consistent with the instant court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was treating patients with homeopathic and alternative medicine therapies. The defendant's patients were charged for the various supplements and tonics that the defendant provided as well as her time. The defendant was charged with violating Mich. Comp. Laws Serv. &sect; 333.16294 after one of her patients requested the State to determine if she was a real doctor. The defendant moved to quash the informations, alleging that the definition of &quot;practice of medicine,&quot; as stated in &sect; 333.17001(d) was void for vagueness and overbroad, as it encompassed conduct and speech protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and because it was so broad that it provided no guidelines to law enforcement. The appellate court noted that, as case law decided since the enactment of the statute limited its application, it did not prohibit individuals from offering their advice as to the best cure and/or remedy for another's malady. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague, as it provided notice of criminal prosecution and did not provide unfettered discretion with law enforcement officials to determine if it had been violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bill was passed that provided for a drug offender's early parole, if a court found that the offender had cooperated with law enforcement after the defendant was convicted. The defendant expressed his willingness to cooperate with law enforcement about the events surrounding his conviction 12 years after he was convicted. The prosecutor never interviewed the defendant, as he doubted that the defendant had any useful information. The trial court denied the defendant's motion, as the defendant had failed to cooperate prior to the passage of the law, and the offer of cooperation 12 years after conviction was not equal to actual cooperation. The appellate court held that the Mich. Comp. Laws Serv. &sect; 791.234 did not place any restrictions as to when the defendant had to offer to cooperate or whether the defendant's information was relevant or useful. To the extent the defendant could provide law enforcement with any specific information pertaining to the execution of law enforcement duties, even if the information was irrelevant, the defendant was deemed to have cooperated for purposes of &sect; 791.234.

Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7401(2)(a)(iv) and possession with intent to deliver less than 50 grams of heroin under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7401(2)(a)(iv).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers modified an arrest warrant and used it as a search warrant but failed to specify with any particularity the items to be seized. The court held that this warrant violated U.S. Const. amend IV, Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1963), and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.654. The court held that had police intended to simply arrest defendant and to seize only those items in plain view or on defendant's person, they should have obtained an arrest warrant to authorize entry into his home. Rather, because the officers modified an arrest warrant to create a search warrant, without specifying the items to be seized, it appeared that the officers intended to enter the house in search for drugs. Further, because the warrant merely described the places to be searched and did not identify the property or thing to be seized, the warrant gave police officers unrestrained, undirected discretion to determine what was subject to seizure, which was precisely what the particularization requirement of U.S. Const. amend. IV sought to prevent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">These were consolidated product liability cases. In the first case, the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan) denied corporate defendants' motion for summary disposition predicated on Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2946(5) and ruled that the statute was unconstitutional. Defendants appealed. In the second case, plaintiffs appealed a summary disposition entered by the Washtenaw Circuit Court (Michigan), which ruled that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs did not contest the applicability of &sect; 600.2946(5) in this case, but they asserted that the statute was unconstitutional because it improperly delegated to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), without establishing standards for oversight, the authority to determine which drugs could be subject to a product liability lawsuit, and thus the power to define what constituted a cause of action under Michigan law. Defendants contended that the legislature in fact exercised its constitutional power to make Michigan law by determining that FDA approval of prescription drugs was an appropriate external standard for defining limits on product liability. The court held that &sect; 600.2946(5) operated as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, as it placed the FDA in the position of final arbiter with respect to whether a particular drug could form the basis of a product liability action in Michigan. Regardless of the expertise the FDA possessed in the area of drug evaluation, specifically regarding safety and fitness determinations, this was unacceptable, as Michigan retained no oversight of this federal agency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wayne circuit court's decision was affirmed, and the Washtenaw circuit court's decision was reversed. The instant court did not retain jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prisoner was incarcerated in a state prison for conviction of second degree murder. The prisoner requested information relating to his arrest and the police investigation from the police department. The police chief twice denied his request pursuant to FOIA. The appellate court held that because FOIA excludes any person serving a sentence in a state or federal correctional facility from its definition of a person entitled to make a request, the summary disposition motion was properly granted. Further, the FOIA statute was not unconstitutional simply because it excluded prisoners. Application of the FOIA exclusion did not deprive the prisoner of his fundamental right to the courts or infringe on his First Amendment rights. The FOIA provisions did not invest the prisoner with a constitutional right to investigate government information. The prisoner failed to show why the information he sought could not have been obtained during trial. The FOIA exclusions were not unconstitutionally vague and did not violate equal protection provisions as incarcerated convicts and convicts who are not incarcerated are not similarly situated. The prisoner's other arguments were also dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court refused to conclude that euthanasia was legal and declined to reverse defendant's conviction on constitutional grounds. Holding otherwise would have expanded the right to privacy to include a right to commit euthanasia and would have placed the issue outside the arenas of public debate and legislative action. Defendant, who chose to represent himself, failed to demonstrate that his attorney, while acting as standby counsel, acted deficiently and prejudicially. The prosecutor's allegedly improper remarks were proper objections to defendant's repeated and improper attempts to inject facts that were not in evidence into his closing argument. As such, the remarks were not references to defendant's failure to testify and were not misconduct.

</DIV>

During 1997, the taxpayer placed in service within and without Michigan over $ 150,000,000 of depreciable property. The taxpayer accordingly filed a tax return taking a capital acquisition deduction (CAD) for the apportioned cost of those assets located in Michigan. Utilizing Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 208.23(e), 208.45(5), the CAD amounted to approximately $ 21,000. In a subsequent tax protest action, the trial court determined that the Single Business Tax Act, Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff stepfather and defendant natural father filed petitions for custody of two children. The circuit court entered an order modifying the judgment of divorce. The natural father filed a petition to change custody of the two minor children from the stepfather to the natural father. The Roscommon Circuit Court, Michigan, entered an order granting the natural father's petition. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that custody of a child should be awarded to a third party custodian instead of the child's natural parent only when the third person has proven that all relevant factors, including the existence of an established custodial environment and all legislatively mandated best interest concerns within &sect; 3 of the Child Custody Act, taken together clearly and convincingly show that the child's best interests required placement with the third person. Only when such a showing has been made should a trial court infringe on the parent's fundamental constitutional rights by awarding custody of the parent's child to a third person. Here, the trial court expressed doubts regarding the proper standard to be applied in deciding the petition for change of custody. In light of the pronouncement in Heltzel regarding the appropriate standard to be applied in custody disputes between a natural parent and a third party custodian, the court of appeals concluded that a remand for an evidentiary hearing was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a child custody dispute, appellant mother sought review of an order of the Cass Circuit Court, Michigan, awarding appellee grandparents physical custody of the minor child, and granting appellant and the appellees joint legal custody of the minor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant contended that the trial court's placement on her of the burden of proving that a change of the child's custody would serve the child's best interests infringed on appellant's fundamental liberty interest in raising her child. The presumption that the best interests of the child would be served by granting custody to the natural parent remained a presumption of the strongest order. Nevertheless, if the clear and convincing evidence established that the best interest of the child was served by awarding custody to the third party, the presumption was rebutted. In this case involving a fit natural mother, the trial court's application of the test constituted clear legal error because it violated defendant's fundamental liberty interest in raising her children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a class of individuals who retired or contemplated retiring under an early retirement program, argued that defendants violated the State Employees Retirement Act (SERA) by withholding money for accumulated sick leave payments. The Legislature placed these monthly accumulated sick leave payments squarely within Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 38.19f(3), which was unambiguously part of the SERA. The right to be paid for accumulated sick leave accrued under the SERA; thus the monthly accumulated sick leave payments were tax-exempt. The court of claims did not err in granting plaintiffs's motion for summary disposition on their contract claim. The defendants's claim that the lower court erred when it concluded that plaintiffs did not have to join as defendants all entities that received the taxes from the monthly accumulated sick leave payments was rejected.</SPAN></P>

Ct. R. 2.116(C)(9), seeking a declaratory ruling that the construction plans of defendants, school district and board of education, were subject to plaintiff township's local zoning regulations, including the site plan review process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants planned construction of a new high school in the township. The township requested that defendants alter construction plans to accommodate certain concerns. Defendants declined to adopt all the requested changes, and the township and the property owners filed a complaint requesting declaratory and injunctive relief. The trial court denied summary judgment, ruling that the Revised School Code exempted defendants from local zoning regulations. On appeal, the appellate court determined the grant of jurisdiction to the superintendent of public instruction under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 380.1263(3) was exclusive and the statute exempted school construction projects from local zoning regulations, including site plan reviews. Therefore, the appellate court concluded the trial court properly denied the property owners' motion for summary disposition under Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(C)(9). In addition, the appellate court concluded that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 380.1263(3) was constitutional because the Revised School Code and the Construction of School Buildings Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 388.851-388.855a, contained adequate safeguards to ensure against misuse of delegated power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 750.316 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.548) for the murder of a corrections officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the appellant argued that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.316(1)(c) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.548(1)(c)), which made the murder of a corrections officer a first-degree murder, violated his due process rights because it did not require the prosecution to prove that he had a guilty intent at the time of the homicide, in effect making it a strict liability crime. The court rejected the appellant's contention and affirmed. The court stated that the crime of murder, no matter its type, required proof of intent. Therefore, the statute was not and did not create a strict liability crime because, to be convicted of murder under the statute the prosecution was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements which required proof of a specific or general intent. The trial court related this to the jury in its closing instructions, informing the jury that it had to find that the appellant intended to kill, or he intended to do great bodily harm, or he knowingly created a very high risk of death or great bodily harm knowing that death or such harm was the likely result of his actions. Therefore there was no due process violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed, and remanded to the trial court for administrative correction of the judgment of sentence consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother brought an action to determine respondent father's parental rights to her child. The St. Clair (Michigan) Circuit Court determined that the father had not established a custodial or supportive relationship with the child. The court then found that placement with the father was not in the child's best interests and terminated his parental rights. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court erred in its ruling that, after considering the factors set forth in &sect; 22(f) of the adoption code, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 710.22(f), placement of the child with him was not in the best interests of the child. The court of appeals affirmed. There was no bond formed between the father and his child as the child had been placed for adoption by the mother immediately after her birth, and there was no exception to the requirement of a showing of emotional ties between the adopting individual and the adoptee. Second, the father failed to show the sort of commitment, permanence and stability in his life that children require. Third, the court was unconvinced by the father's portrayal of his doubts over paternity as a unique condition that should have excused him from offering support to the mother and her child. Finally, the record did not support the father's contention that he was denied the opportunity to support his child, undermining his argument that he was denied due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although he was not married to the mother of his child, defendant father signed an acknowledgment of parentage the day after his son's birth. Following the mother's death, plaintiff maternal grandmother filed a third-party action for custody pursuant to the Child Custody Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.26c(1)(b). Defendant appealed the trial court's order granting plaintiff custody. He argued that plaintiff lacked standing to bring the action. Defendant also claimed judicial bias. Rejecting his arguments, the appellate court held that was no error in the trial court's determination that plaintiff established standing to seek custody of her grandchild under &sect; 722.26c(1)(b), as the Child Custody Act controlled, not the Acknowledgment of Parentage Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.1001 et seq. Defendant's claim of judicial bias was also without merit. To establish judicial bias, defendant was required to demonstrate that the trial court displayed a deep-seated favoritism that made fair judgment impossible. The record reflected that the trial court conducted the hearing fairly and its opinion demonstrated a thorough and impartial consideration of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions stemmed from a two-car collision that occurred during a drag race between defendants. The victim was a 15-year-old girl, who was a passenger in one defendant's vehicle. There was evidence that defendants were drag racing at very high speeds into an intersection while intoxicated. The defense was that the reckless driving had stopped at the time of the accident and that the accident was the result of brake failure. The appellate court found that: (1) there was no prosecutorial misconduct, (2) the photographs were relevant and defendants failed to show that the probative value was substantially outweighed by prejudice, (3) defendants' blood test results were admissible because they were both involved in the accident, (4) the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of second-degree murder, including malice, were proved beyond a reasonable doubt, (5) the jury instructions were correct, (6) the sentences imposed were proportionate to the seriousness of the crime and defendants' prior records, and (7) the other issues raised were not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action stemming from plaintiff's discharge from her employment, plaintiff alleged that defendant state agency violated the Michigan Civil Rights Act (CRA), by discriminating against her on the basis of race and marital status and that defendant wrongfully discharged her. The Ingham Circuit Court (Michigan) granted defendant's motion for summary disposition or dismissal of both counts of plaintiff's complaint. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant terminated plaintiff's employment as a supervisory corrections officer because she violated a work rule prohibiting cohabitation with a probationer or parolee except in certain circumstances involving marital relationships. On appeal, plaintiff argued that the trial court erred in dismissing her CRA claim on the basis that the applicable three-year period of limitation barred her claims. Plaintiff contended that her claims accrued on March 22, 1996, which was the last day that she was employed by defendant, and that she filed her complaint two years later on April 30, 1998. However, defendant claimed that the date it initially terminated plaintiff's employment was May 26, 1994, and that the statute of limitations barred her claim. The instant court concluded that plaintiff's claims accrued on May 26, 1994. Although plaintiff was technically reinstated for a period as result of administrative decisions and again discharged, the second discharge did not apply for purposes of calculating the limitations period. Plaintiff also failed to exhaust administrative remedies, as she did not pursue an appeal of the final Civil Service Commission decision to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with the crime of riot under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 752.541 (Mich. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with the crime of riot based on their actions while they protested another organization's demonstration. Defendants filed motions to quash the informations, arguing that the prosecutor mischarged them and that the riot statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 752.541 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.790(1)), was unconstitutional both on its face and as applied. The circuit court granted the motions. On appeal, the State contended that the on-duty police were the &quot;public&quot; within the meaning of the statute. The court of appeals reversed, holding that whether police officers were members of the public for purposes of the statute was not the critical inquiry. The prohibited conduct under the statute included violent acts that intentionally alarmed the public or showed a conscious disregard of the risk of alarming the public. Defendants' violent acts occurred in a public area and around a public building, and there was a risk of causing public alarm, especially because the violent conduct prevented police from performing their protective function. Further, the statute was not vague or overbroad, as it gave adequate guidance as to what constituted the crime of riot.</SPAN></P>

The parties stipulated that some hazardous substances were disposed of or placed on the property by the prior owner. Both parties submitted appraisals, which the trial court averaged to find the value of the land. The appellate court found that: (1) the trial court erred when it deducted estimated environmental cleanup costs to arrive at a just compensation amount because the trial court was not vested with the authority to account for estimated remediation costs when calculating just compensation, (2) there was no error in finding the value of the land at the time of taking, and (3) there was no error in finding that the value of the adjacent complex was not affected by the taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Landowner of residential property challenged town's zoning law. The law was upheld and affirmed on appeal. Landowner moved to reconsider, but never acted on it. Landowner and town persuaded the trial court to enter a consent judgment so landowner could commercially develop his land in exchange for concessions. Neighbors objected, and sought to intervene. The trial court granted intervention, and set aside the consent judgment. Landowner appealed. The appellate court held that neighbors could intervene because their interests were inadequately represented. Landowner's motion could not revive the old litigation, or provide a basis for the consent judgment. If circumstances had changed enough to warrant commercial development of the land, landowner should have either have re-zoned the property or obtained a variance. The consent judgment merely attempted to side-step zoning procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed an appeal of the order of the Bay Circuit Court Family Division (Michigan) terminating her parental rights in accordance with Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 712A.19b(3)(c)(i) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27.3178(598.19b)(3)(c)(i)) and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 712A.19b(3)(g) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27.3178(598.19b)(3)(g)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mother contended that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.638 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25.248(18)) (1997) violated her due process and equal protection rights. The appellate court held that she had standing to challenge the statute as amended because her contention related to common language of the pre-amendment and post-amendment statute. She argued that the statute created two classifications - parents who had parental rights terminated in the past, and parents who had not - and treated them differently without justification because the statute stated that under certain circumstances a petitioner shall request the court to terminate parental rights with respect to any child born to a parent whose parental rights were terminated in the past. The court found that the statute served a compelling state interest of protecting children from unreasonable risks of harm, and it was precisely tailored to serve this interest. While the statute did in effect create a separate class of parents, the court concluded that it did not violate equal protection nor procedural due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a claim alleging medical malpractice against defendants. Plaintiff moved for an extension of time for filing the affidavit of merit pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2912 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.2912). However, the mere filing of a motion to extend the time for filing was insufficient to toll the statute of limitations. Plaintiff's motion was not called to the trial court's attention until more than four months after the expiration of the statute of limitations. Plaintiff's claim that the affidavit of merit requirement was unconstitutional was rejected. Requiring an affidavit of merit was rationally related to achieving the result of reduced frivolous medical malpractice claims. Plaintiff's second complaint was identical to the first complaint; thus it was properly dismissed as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Because plaintiff was not granted an extension of time to file the affidavit of merit, and because a medical malpractice complaint filed without an affidavit of merit was insufficient to commence the lawsuit, the trial court properly dismissed the complaint with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The car that she was driving was registered to her ex-husband and was uninsured. Plaintiff filed suit, alleging negligence. Defendants moved for summary disposition on the basis that plaintiff, as an uninsured motorist, was precluded from seeking noneconomic damages pursuant to Mich. Comp.

Under the statute, damages could not be assessed in favor of a party who was operating his own vehicle without insurance at the time of the injury. While plaintiff claimed that she merely borrowed the car, her use of the car comported with the concept of ownership.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed an order of the Michigan Worker's Compensation Appellate Commission affirming a magistrate's order setting the amount of weekly wage loss benefits to be paid to plaintiff during various time periods. Plaintiff cross-appealed the magistrate's denial of benefits for an alleged subsequent injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that he injured his back at work in July 1989 and reinjured it in December 1994. The magistrate granted an open award of weekly wage loss benefits based on the July 1989 injury date. The amount of benefits awarded varied, as plaintiff was single with no dependents from July 1989 through October 1995, was married with no dependents from October 1995 through July 1996, and was married with a dependent son after July 1996. Defendants argued that plaintiff's tax status should have been fixed as of his July 1989 injury date. The instant court concluded that the magistrate correctly determined that plaintiff was entitled to an increase in wage loss benefits after the birth of his son. However, the instant court ruled that change in plaintiff's marital status should not have been taken into account in setting the benefit rate. Plaintiff's issue on cross-appeal was not preserved for appellate consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed in part and the case was remanded for entry of an order adjusting the amount of plaintiff's weekly wage loss benefits to reflect the addition of a conclusive dependent only. The instant court did not retain jurisdiction. There was no basis for the increase in benefits based on plaintiff's marriage and the corresponding change in his tax filing status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a former state legislator, sued defendant, the state central committee of a political party, alleging that defendant published defamatory statements about him in a brochure, shortly before an election. The statements alleged that plaintiff had misused his legislative immunity to avoid a civil suit and a speeding ticket. A district court jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff, awarding compensatory and punitive damages. The circuit court affirmed the verdict, and defendant appealed. The court of appeals reversed, finding that the evidence of actual malice admitted at trial fell below the clear and convincing level applied to public figures under New York Times v. Sullivan. There was no evidence that defendant had knowledge that any of the statements contained in its brochure were false at the time of publication, nor was there any clear and convincing evidence that defendant published the brochure with reckless disregard of whether the statements were false.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought dismissal of charges brought under the criminal abortion statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.14 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.204) for allegedly inducing the abortion of a fetus of approximately 28 weeks, and altering a patient's medical records. The Michigan Supreme Court, in an earlier case, addressed the constitutionality of the statute. Rather than declare the statute unconstitutional as irreconcilable with United States Supreme Court precedent, the statute was construed to conform to constitutional requirements. Defendant's argument that the statute was repealed by implication was rejected. Defendant's constitutional arguments could not insulate him from prosecution because the statute, as construed, clearly reached the conduct involved in this prosecution. Factual allegations were sufficient because they adequately informed defendant of the substance of the accusations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of charges was reversed. The abortion statute was not repealed by implication, or was it void for vagueness. The factual allegations were sufficient. The statute conformed to constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 750.520c(1)(b)(iii) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.788(3)(1)(b)(iii)), in the Jackson (Michigan) Circuit Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of second degree criminal sexual conduct for engaging in sexual contact with a minor. This was done under the ruse of giving reiki lessons to the complainant, a 14-year old boy. On appeal, appellant contended that he did not use a position of authority to coerce the complainant into engaging in sexual contact. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that appellant's conduct constituted coercion for purposes of the second degree sexual conduct statute because he abused his position of authority to constrain a vulnerable victim by subjugation to submit to sexual contact. Ample expert testimony established that reiki training did not involve the &quot;techniques&quot; appellant claimed he was teaching complainant, and appellant's position was not any less authoritative than that in a traditional teacher-student relationship. Second, although there was a 20-year gap between a prior conviction and this incident, the evidence was highly probative of appellant's common scheme based on appellant's prior conduct in approaching and isolating his victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed. Appellant exploited and abused his position of authority to compel a vulnerable youth to engage in sexual contact; this clearly constituted coercion for purposes of the statute. Second, the probative value of the similar acts evidence was not substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, rental unit owners' association and two members, sued defendant city to challenge the validity and constitutionality of an amendment to a city ordinance which required plaintiffs to have paid all previously billed property taxes before defendant had to issue a certificate of compliance so plaintiffs could rent their properties. Plaintiffs argued the ordinance, Muskegon, Mich., Code of Ordinances, &sect; 4-83(b), was unenforceable and unconstitutional as it preempted state law, conflicted with the city's charter, failed to afford substantive due process, and failed to afford equal protection to plaintiffs' members. Plaintiffs moved for summary disposition as did defendant. The trial court granted defendant's motion and rejected plaintiffs' contentions. Plaintiffs appealed. The appellate court affirmed in part. The ordinance did not preempt state law, violate the city charter, or deny substantive due process. However, the court reversed in part, because as businesses operating nonrental properties were not required to pay real property or income taxes before they were entitled to obtain their certificates to operate, the ordinance violated equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order of the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan) dismissing an information charging defendant with owning a dog, trained or used for fighting, that caused the death of a person on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman was mauled to death by defendant's pit bulls while he was incarcerated. He was indicted for owning a dog trained or used for fighting that caused the death of a person, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.49(10) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.244(10)). Neighbors testified the dogs had been trained to fight and that they had seen dogfights staged in defendant's back yard. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court granted the motion and the State appealed. The court held a statute could be challenged for vagueness where it was overbroad and impinged on U.S. Const. amend. I freedoms, it did not provide fair notice of the conduct proscribed, or where it was so indefinite that it conferred unstructured and unlimited discretion on the trier of fact to determine whether the law had been violated. The court affirmed, holding the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as it clearly provided notice and fair warning to defendant that owning such an animal subjected him to criminal liability if the animal killed a person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed, because the statute proscribing owning a dog trained or used for fighting was not unconstitutionally vague as it clearly provided notice and fair warning to defendant that he owned such an animal at his own peril and could be held criminally liable if the animal killed a person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found two errors in the trial court's rulings during defendant's trial, but held that those errors were harmless. Applying the Golochowicz test for determining whether to admit modus operandi evidence, the court held that the trial court appropriately admitted evidence that defendant accosted two middle school employees but erred in admitting evidence that defendant robbed a hotel clerk. There was not substantial evidence that defendant committed the latter offense, and the characteristics of that offense were not sufficiently similar to the charged offense to establish logical relevance. The trial court erred in allowing the police to testify about statements defendant's wife made to them and to a friend. Corroborating evidence could not be used to bolster an untrustworthy statement, and there was not sufficient evidence of trustworthiness to satisfy the requirements of the Confrontation Clause of U.S. Const. amend. VI. Even without the challenged testimony, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police, due to inexperience, shifts in personnel, and an incomplete warrant package from the prosecutor's office, held appellee without arraignment for at least 81 hours after her warrantless arrest. After giving one statement, appellee asked to give another one, which implicated her in a homicide. Appellee was charged with murder and moved to suppress her second statement. Suppression was granted based on the length of the delay, regardless of the statement's voluntariness. The court reversed and remanded to the trial court instead to consider whether the statement was voluntary based on the totality of the circumstances, of which the delay was but one factor. The delay, in excess of 48 hours, shifted the burden to appellant State to justify it. It was not automatic that evidence obtained during a U.S. Const. amend. IV violation had to be excluded. The record indicated neither that appellee had been coerced nor that her right to leave had been conditioned upon giving a statement, even though officers might have said that she could leave after doing so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action involving appellee power company's request for a suspension of its power supply cost recovery clause, appellant challenged the order terminating the proceedings. Appellant, the attorney general, was both the appellant and counsel for appellee power company. The court raised the issue of the apparent conflict of interest of appellant regarding her dual roles. By mutual agreement, appellant eventually appointed an attorney as special assistant attorney general for appellee power company. However, a stipulation for substitution of counsel was not filed. The court reasoned that the rules recognized a clear conflict of interest when an attorney general acted as a party litigant in opposition to an agency or department that she also represented in the same cause of action. The court held that a conflict of interest also arose when the appellant intervened as a party in opposition to a state agency that she represents as counsel. Thus, the court ordered appellant to file a stipulation of substitute counsel for appellee power company or consent of client for continuation of counsel after consultation regarding the conflict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sold its business within the state and paid taxes on the gain of assets derived from this sale.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged the decision of the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted summary disposition to defendant and denied summary disposition to plaintiff, in plaintiff's complaint for a writ of mandamus, arising out of plaintiff's conviction for armed robbery and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was sentenced for his convictions for armed robbery and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. While serving his sentence, plaintiff had accumulated 540 days emergency credit toward his minimum sentence pursuant to the Prison Overcrowding Emergency Powers Act (POEPA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 800.71 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.1437(1)). POEPA was repealed in 1987. Plaintiff sought a writ of mandamus, arguing that the repeal of POEPA violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. art 1, &sect; 10, cl. 1, because it lengthened his term of imprisonment, thereby inflicting a harsher punishment than existed prior to the repeal. The trial court denied the petition. The instant court affirmed. The award of emergency credits to appellant under POEPA was not automatic, rather discretionary authority was given to the governor. This discretionary authority meant that what plaintiff lost was the opportunity to be awarded early release credits if the governor determined that certain conditions, not under plaintiff's control, came into being. The loss of this opportunity by the repeal of POEPA did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.</SPAN></P>

The award of emergency credits was to appellant under was not automatic, rather discretionary authority was given to the governor. Plaintiff lost the opportunity to be awarded early release credits if the governor determined that certain conditions, not under plaintiff's control, came into being, and therefore loss of this opportunity did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State appealed the judgment of the Cheboygan Circuit Court (Michigan), which reversed a misdemeanor conviction of minor in possession of alcohol, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 436.1703(1)(a) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18.1175(703)(1)(a)), on the grounds that defendant was entitled to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant refused a breath test, the police officer charged him with misdemeanor minor in possession of alcohol, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 436.1703(1)(a) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18.1175(703)(1)(a). Defendant was convicted at a bench trial. The circuit court reversed. The appellate court affirmed and remanded. Although defendant's violation was a petty offense because the statute exempted him from incarceration under the Liquor Control Code, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 436.1909 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18.1175(909)), it was still a &quot;crime&quot; under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.5 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.195) because of the word &quot;misdemeanor&quot; and the potential for penal discipline consisting of fines, service, or treatment under &sect; 436.1703(1)(a) (&sect; 18.1175(703)(1)(a)) and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 436.33b(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18.1004(2)(1)). Defendant's was neither a quasi-crime nor civil violation. The unbroken history of Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20's jury trial provision was a compelling reason to find that its protection exceeded that of U.S. Const. amend. VI to include petty crimes other than criminal contempt, regardless of the potential for incarceration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reversal of conviction was affirmed. The Michigan constitution's jury provision's protection was greater than the United States Constitution's provision, extending to petty crimes other than criminal contempt, regardless of the potential for incarceration. The word &quot;misdemeanor&quot; referring to minor in possession of alcohol clearly indicated a crime, not a quasi-crime or a civil violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an incident at school between a student and appellee teacher, appellant city school system requested termination based on use of excessive force and unlawfully inflicting corporal punishment on a student. The Detroit Board of Education terminated appellee's employment. On remand from the court of appeals, the State Tenure Commission determined that appellee had violated the policy against use of excessive force. The circuit court reversed, citing the lack of competent, material, and substantial evidence to support the commission's decision. The court of appeals affirmed. On its face, the policy appeared to permit the use of restraint to prevent a student from causing injury to others or to himself or herself. While appellee was not attempting to prevent injury, the court failed to see how the commission found excessive force in appellee's removing the student from the school gym by the arm. In light of that conclusion, the court declined to discuss due process issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Circuit court decision affirmed. In the court's view, the record did not indicate that appellee used any kind of excessive force in removing the student from the school gym by the arm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervening defendants Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) and Parole Board (board) claimed the lower court was without authority to revisit a sentence previously imposed on defendant parolee. The board had imposed on defendant parolee, as part of his parole revocation, a 12-month parole continuance, rather than a three-year continuance as requested by the State. The State appealed, asking the circuit court to modify defendant parolee's sentence or to declare MDOC's Policy Directive 06.05.104 unconstitutional. The circuit court accommodated the State's request. The instant court reversed. The circuit court lacked authority to modify defendant parolee's sentence. He had begun serving his sentence. Further, because he was on parole, he was still in the legal custody of MDOC. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 791.234(7) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.2304(7)) did not give the State standing to appeal defendant board's revocation decision. The circuit court erred in considering the appeal and in declaring Michigan Department of Corrections Policy Directive 06.05.104 unconstitutional; the separation of powers doctrine was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed. Although Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2169 (Mich. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant putative father challenged an order from the Bay Circuit Court, Family Division (Michigan), which terminated his parental rights under the Adoption Code, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 710.39(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27.3178(555.39)(2)), after determining appellant had not provided substantial and regular support or care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved a direct placement adoption in which appellee mother placed the child with a specific couple. Appellant putative father refused to sign the consent for adoption and sought custody.

Ann &sect; 27.3178 (555.39)(2)). The appellate court held the legislature did not intend to create a deceived father exception to the requirement that a father provide substantial and regular care and support to the mother during pregnancy in order to come within Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 710.39(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27.3178(555.39)(2)). The trial court properly found appellant's rights should be determined under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 710.39(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann &sect; 27.3178 (555.39)(1)). Because a fundamental right was not involved, strict scrutiny was not the appropriate level of scrutiny to evaluate the equal protection challenge. Employing a rational basis standard, the court found appellant's equal protection rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prosecutor sued appellee department of corrections, challenging appellee's orders discharging unserved maximum sentences once it discharged a prisoner from parole. Appellant argued that the legislature's grant of such authority under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 791.242 (Mich. Stat.

The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action. The appellate court affirmed because the statute only required that a parolee faithfully perform all the conditions of parole for the period of time fixed in the parole order and obey all the rules and regulations adopted by the parole board so that it could enter a final order of discharge. The statute contained no language that limited the discharge provision only if the first grant of parole was successfully completed.</SPAN></P>
