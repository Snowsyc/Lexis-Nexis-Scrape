P. 8 did not require plaintiff, before discovery, to identify each seized item and document and to show that each fell outside the scope of the warrant; [3]-Because the District of Columbia was the forum &quot;state&quot; in the case, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, District of Columbia law provided the applicable statute of limitation. From the time the officers entered plaintiff's home, he was not free to leave, so was imprisoned for purposes of tolling under D.C.

As the Department correctly pointed out, DOT officials repeatedly explained the agency's long-standing prohibition against the release of (urine) samples for DNA testing, and cited and extensively quoted the relevant regulations to document their position; [2]-The meaning of 49 C.F.R. &sect; 40.13(c) is clear on its face: a laboratory is prohibited from making a DOT urine specimen available for a DNA test or other types of specimen identity testing; [3]-The Rule is not arbitrary or capricious; [4]-The Rule does not violate the Omnibus Act; [5]-Petitioner's constitutional arguments also lacked merit. In the absence of any limiting terms, the plain--and certainly not vague--meaning of the regulation prohibits release of the urine sample to anybody, 49 C.F.R. &sect; 40.13(c).</SPAN></P>

It was apparent from the record that the USPC applied the 1987 regulations, which were in effect when the prisoner committed the underlying criminal offense.</SPAN></P>

I because there is no evidence that ill-informed guides are indeed a problem for the District of Columbia's tourism industry, there is no evidence the exam regulation actually furthers the District's interest in preventing the stated harms, and the tour-bus exemption is arbitrary and renders the regulations impermissibly underinclusive.</SPAN></P>

L. No. 107-228, 116 Stat. 1350. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act required the Secretary to record &quot;Israel&quot; as the place of birth on the passport of a United States citizen born in Jerusalem if the citizen so requested. The court held that &sect; 214(d) was unconstitutional because it impermissibly intruded on the President's exclusive authority to decide whether and on what terms to recognize foreign nations. Section 214(d) conflicted with the long-standing Executive branch policy of neutrality on what nation or government, if any, was sovereign over Jerusalem. U.S. Presidents had consistently endeavored not to engage in official actions that would recognize, or might be perceived as constituting recognition of, Jerusalem as either the capital city of Israel or as a city located within the sovereign territory of Israel. By attempting to alter the State Department's treatment of passport applicants born in Jerusalem, &sect; 214(d) directly contradicted a carefully considered exercise of the Executive branch's recognition power. The Executive branch's belief that &sect; 214(d) would cause adverse foreign policy consequences was conclusive on the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Mississippi and industry petitioners (collectively &quot;Mississippi) challenged EPA's threshold decision to revise the primary NAAQS level. According to Mississippi, several aspects of EPA's decision were arbitrary, including its allegedly unsupported finding that the revised NAAQS would provide increased protection; its failure to compare the 2008 risk assessment with the 1997 risk assessment; and the allegedly inadequate and distorted science on which the agency relied. The court rejected these arguments. Next, it noted that the governmental and environmental petitioners argued that the NAAQS was too lax. The Clean Air Act required the court to overturn any EPA action that was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or contrary to law, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7607(d)(9)(A). EPA's treatment of the evidence satisfied the court's deferential standard of review. Finally, the court found that EPA's justification for the secondary standard was inadequate under American Farm Bureau. Because EPA failed to determine what level of protection was &quot;requisite to protect the public welfare,&quot; 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7409(b)(2), its explanation for the secondary standard violated the Clean Air Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the secondary NAAQS to EPA for reconsideration. In all other respects, the petitions for review were denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordered petitioner energy trader to pay a $50,000 civil penalty because he had made false statements and material omissions in forms he filed with FERC and a market operator FERC regulated. The trader appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trader argued that he was entitled to an administrative hearing under 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 823b(d)(2)(A). The appellate court noted that no evidentiary hearing was needed. The trader's affidavit made the violation clear. He admitted that he falsified and omitted multiple names on his forms, and that he had kept his involvement in a company a secret to avoid alerting his employer to his violation of the non-compete. The trader's admissions resolved all disputes of material fact, making an evidentiary hearing unnecessary. Because the trader's actions were worse than careless, FERC reasonably concluded that he violated Market Behavior Rule 3. FERC's goal was to ensure that inadvertent false submissions would not be penalized. The trader's false filings were not inadvertent. FERC followed its own summary disposition rule concerning evidence. The trader was not permitted to introduce new evidence, 18 C.F.R. &sect; 385.213(a)(2). FERC's decision to impose a $50,000 penalty was rationally supported by multiple pieces of evidence. The penalty was not increased to promote general deterrence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pilot submitted an application for a medical certificate using the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) online system.

The pilot had been arrested, but not convicted, for drunk driving. The FAA revoked his certificate and the pilot appealed. The pilot testified that he had not read the question carefully to understand that arrests without convictions were included. The ALJ concluded that the pilot had violated 14 C.F.R. &sect; 67.403(a)(1) because he intentionally failed to carefully read the question. On review, the court affirmed because the case was indistinguishable from a similar case where the court had affirmed application of the regulation in the same way. While the pilot argued that the online application entrapped him into not reading all the questions carefully, the court reaffirmed that an intentional failure to carefully read the questions before submitting answers was sufficient to meet the regulation's scienter requirement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a &quot;Deferral Rule&quot; deferring regulation of &quot;biogenic&quot; carbon dioxide (BCD) for 3 years, citing scientific uncertainty over how to account for BCD's unique role in the carbon cycle, and justifying the Rule on the basis of the one-step-at-a-time and administrative necessity doctrines. Petitioner environmental groups sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Rule, BCD sources with a potential to emit over certain thresholds did not require a permit, while &quot;anyway&quot; sources (those that required a permit anyway due to conventional pollutants) still had to install the best available control technology (BACT) for BCD emissions. The EPA's invocation of the one-step-at-a-time doctrine was arbitrary and capricious because the Rule failed to offer an interpretation of the Clean Air Act that allowed treating BCD sources differently, and not merely due to scientific uncertainty. A middle-ground option, requiring permits only if a BCD source failed to try to account for net carbon cycle impacts, would have reduced emissions from sources the Rule permanently exempted. Rejecting that option without explanation was arbitrary and capricious, given that despite scientific uncertainty about measuring BCD emissions at the Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality applicability stage, the unique characteristics of those sources could be factored in at the BACT stage. The absurd results doctrine was mentioned only in passing references that did not satisfy the fundamental obligation to set forth reasons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railroad trade association sued appellees, including the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the constitutionality of Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA), Pub. L. No. 110-432, Div. B, &sect; 207, 122 Stat. 4848. The district court granted summary judgment to appellees. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 207 of the PRIIA (49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 24101 note) empowered the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) and the FRA to jointly develop metrics and standards for measuring the performance of passenger train operations. If any intercity passenger train failed to meet those standards, and if the Surface Transportation Board (STB) found that such failure was attributable to a rail carrier's failure to provide preference to Amtrak over freight transportation, the STB could award damages or other relief against the rail carrier. The court of appeals held that &sect; 207 constituted an unlawful delegation of regulatory power to a private entity. The STB's involvement did not did not prevent the statute from being unconstitutional. Further, &sect; 207 permitted Amtrak to petition for binding arbitration if it could not reach agreement with the FRA, which raised the possibility that metrics and standards could have gone into effect without the assent of any government representative. Amtrak, which was required under 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 24301(a)(2) to operate as a private, for-profit corporation, was a private corporation with respect to Congress's power to delegate regulatory authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee tobacco &quot;delivery seller&quot; sought to enjoin appellant U.S. Attorney General's enforcement of the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act (PACT Act), requiring payment of state and local taxes and banning use of U.S. mail, as violating due process, equal protection, and the Tenth Amendment. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia enjoined enforcement of tax provisions on due process grounds only. Cross-appeals were filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was a novel and close question for due process purposes as to whether the seller had to have minimum contacts with the state and local government, which defined and benefited from the tax, or the federal government, which imposed and enforced the tax. Therefore, a finding that the seller was likely to succeed on the merits was not an abuse of discretion. Even a federal duty to comply with state and local tax laws could transgress due process limits on the taxation power. Factual development would benefit the question of whether, in the Internet age, a single sale might establish minimum contacts as a matter of law. PACT Act burdens were different from those that had been held to violate the Tenth Amendment. Congress could pursue permissible policy goals by directly regulating private parties rather than states, which was what Congress did in the PACT Act. The Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection challenges to the ban on shipping tobacco products in the U.S. mail failed under rational basis review. The legislative record showed a rational basis: delivery sellers had been successful at eluding traditional enforcement measures, by making their deliveries by mail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, pilots over 60 years old, sued defendants, the Federal Aviation Administration and an airline, challenging the constitutionally of 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 44729(e)(1)'s nonretroactivity provision as to an increased retirement age (Age 65 Rule), the protection-for-compliance provision of &sect; 44729(e)(2), and alleging discriminatory interpretations. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found for defendants. The pilots appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Had Congress given the Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act of 2007 full retroactive effect, airlines might have re-hired a significant number of over-60 pilots with full seniority, thus &quot;bumping&quot; less senior pilots and firing others. Congress thus did not act unreasonably or irrationally in tailoring the retroactive effect to minimize the potential disruption to labor relations in the industry, and an equal protection challenge failed. Just as there had been no procedural due process violation in the prior Age 60 Rule, the nonretroactivity provision to the Age 65 Rule did not violate due process. The Act created more piloting opportunities for over-60 pilots, thus, a bill of attainder claim failed. The &quot;in such operations&quot; language in &sect; 44729(e)(1)(A) modified &quot;that air carrier,&quot; not &quot;such person.&quot; Because over-60 persons were barred from piloting the covered flights under the Age 60 Rule, only those over-60 persons serving in certain capacities qualified for &sect; 44729(e)(1)(A)'s exemption; that exemption did not apply. The nonretroactivity provision had been properly applied and thus &quot;taken in conformance&quot; with the Age 60 and 65 Rules under &sect; 44729(e)(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">47 C.F.R. &sect; 76.1302(h)'s limitations period was not a jurisdictional barrier.

Nothing showed that accepting the USPN's proposal, that its programming be repositioned onto a broader distribution &quot;tier,&quot; would have afforded the company any benefit. Nothing refuted the company's contention that rejection was simply a straight up financial analysis, that repositioning would not have resulted in an increase in revenue for the company, let alone revenue sufficient to offset the increased fees. Nothing showed corresponding benefits that would accrue to the company by its accepting the change. The record was very strong on the proposed increment in licensing fees, in itself a clear negative. That the USPN charged less per &quot;rating point&quot; than the affiliated networks was not affirmative evidence that accepting the proposal could have offered the company any net gain.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2(a)(1)(A) gave the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over transactions conducted on futures markets, and 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 717t-2(c) of the Natural Gas Act provided that it had no effect on the CFTC's exclusive jurisdiction. FERC fined the employee for trading natural gas futures contracts with the intent to manipulate the price of natural gas in another market. The alleged scheme thus involved transactions of a commodity futures contract. By &sect; 2(a)(1)(A)'s plain terms, the CFTC had exclusive jurisdiction over the manipulation of natural gas futures contracts. Any infringement of the CFTC's exclusive jurisdiction would effectively repeal &sect; 2(a)(1)(A). Because FERC was free to prohibit manipulative trading in markets outside the CFTC's exclusive jurisdiction, there was no irreconcilable conflict between the two statutes and therefore no repeal by implication. By requiring the two agencies to enter into a memorandum of understanding to ensure that information requests to markets within the respective jurisdiction of each agency were properly coordinated, &sect; 717t-2(c)(1) indicated that the two agencies regulates separate markets.</SPAN></P>

The company also argued that the NLRB lacked authority to act for want of a quorum, as three members of the five-member Board were never validly appointed because they took office under putative recess appointments which were made when the Senate was not in recess. Second, it asserted that the vacancies these three members purportedly filled did not happen during the Recess of the Senate, as required for recess appointments by the U.S. Constitution. The appointments were constitutionally invalid and the Board therefore lacked a quorum. The NLRB conceded that the appointments at issue were not made during the intersession recess: the President made his three appointments to the NLRB on January 4, 2012, after Congress began a new session on January 3 and while that new session continued. Considering the text, history, and structure of the Constitution, these appointments were invalid from their inception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court's instructions on the honest-services counts misstated the law, the jury lacked sufficient evidence to find that an official act underlay the illegal-gratuity charge, and the district court ran afoul of Fed. R. Evid. 403 and the First Amendment when it admitted evidence of his lawful campaign contributions. The arguments failed. The attorney acted in his official capacity to influence the visa application process. The attorney himself lacked independent authority to expedite visa applications, but defendant's attempt to import a requirement that the official in question was to have ultimate decisionmaking authority into the definition of official act had no statutory basis. The district court repeatedly instructed the jury that the campaign contributions were not illegal which did much to mitigate the potential for confusion and First Amendment chilling, even if it could not entirely eliminate the potential for prejudice. Moreover, the probative value of the contribution evidence and the extent to which it was inexorably intertwined with other evidence weighed heavily in favor of admission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a misdemeanant and a gun advocacy group, sued defendants, the U.S. Attorney General and others, to challenge 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 922(g)(1) which barred for life common-law misdemeanants from possessing a firearm. Plaintiffs alleged that the application of &sect; 922(g)(1) to that class of offenders violated the Second Amendment. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued, in part, that &sect; 922(g)(1) was inapplicable to common-law offenses because such offenses were not punishable by any particular statutory criteria. The court doubted that when Congress expanded the firearms prohibition to cover all individuals convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, it intended to exclude all common-law offenses, even those that previously fell within the ambit of the federal firearms ban. The common-sense meaning of the term &quot;punishable&quot; referred to any punishment capable of being imposed, not necessarily a punishment specified by statute. And, because common-law offenses were capable of being punished by more than two years' imprisonment, they were ineligible for &sect; 921(a)(20)(B)'s misdemeanor exception. There was no constitutional infirmity in the application of &sect; 922(g)(1) to common-law misdemeanants as a class. The court applied intermediate scrutiny and concluded that the statute easily met that standard. The disarmament of common-law misdemeanants as a class was substantially related to the important governmental objective of crime prevention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court.</SPAN></P>

The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the complaint, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction due to the Administrative Office's sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The job applicant, a resident of Kentucky, wanted to work for the Administrative Office, but it rejected her application because she did not live or work in the Washington metropolitan area. Her claim fell within the Larson-Dugan exception. Her sole allegation was that the named officers acted unconstitutionally, and she requested only injunctive and declaratory relief. Although the district court suggested and defendants argued that the Larson-Dugan exception was limited to cases alleging that defendants have acted beyond statutory authority, there was no basis for such a limitation in the logic of the ultra vires rationale for the exception. Moreover, such a limitation contradicted Larson's own language, which excepted suits alleging that the agent acted beyond statutory authority or unconstitutionally. It was also contrary to Dugan, which noted recognized exceptions to the general rule of federal sovereign immunity, for suits alleging that (1) actions by officers were beyond their statutory powers and (2) even though within the scope of their authority, the powers themselves or the manner in which they were exercised are constitutionally void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wireless telephone company challenged appellee Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adoption of a rule requiring mobile-data providers to offer roaming agreements to other such providers on commercially reasonable terms.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 303(b) directed the FCC, consistent with the public interest, to prescribe the nature of the service to be rendered by each class of licensed stations and each station within any class. Prescribe meant, among other things, to lay down a rule. That was exactly what the data roaming rule did--it laid down a rule about the nature of the service to be rendered by entities licensed to provide mobile-data service. Especially when taken together with &sect; 303(r), which supplemented the FCC's ability to carry out its mandates via rulemaking even if it confers no independent authority, and 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 316, which enabled the FCC to alter the term of existing licenses by rulemaking, it was clear that the data roaming rule fell well within the FCC's Title III authority. The FCC's classification of the voice roaming rule as a common carrier obligation did not amount to a conclusion that automatic-roaming requirements necessarily entailed common carriage. The data roaming order did not contravene the statutory exclusion of mobile-internet providers from common carrier status.</SPAN></P>

The en banc Court of Military Commission Review affirmed the conviction. The combatant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Despite the combatant's release from custody, his case was not moot. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 did not to authorize retroactive prosecution of crimes that were not prohibited as war crimes triable by military commission under U.S. law at the time the combatant's conduct occurred. When the combatant committed the relevant conduct from 1996 to 2001, 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 821 provided that military commissions could try violations of the law of war. The &quot;law of war&quot; cross-referenced in that statute was the international law of war. The international law of war proscribed a variety of war crimes, including forms of terrorism. At that time, however, the international law of war did not proscribe material support for terrorism as a war crime. Therefore, the relevant statute at the time of the combatant's conduct -- &sect; 821 -- did not proscribe material support for terrorism as a war crime. Because the circuit court read the Military Commissions Act not to sanction retroactive punishment for new crimes, and because material support for terrorism was not a pre-existing war crime under &sect; 821, the combatant's conviction for material support for terrorism could not stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and it was directed that the combatant's conviction for material support for terrorism be vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being dismissed on his sixty-fifth birthday, plaintiff employee brought suit alleging that his forced retirement violated the federal employment provisions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 633a. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a U.S. citizen who was employed by the State Department as a safety inspector at the U.S. embassy in Paris, France. He was hired as &quot;locally employed staff&quot; pursuant to a personal services agreement One provision of the Local Compensation Plan was a mandatory retirement clause that followed the (apparently) prevailing French practice of mandating retirement at age sixty-five. The district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the statute under which the employee was hired, &sect; 2(c) of the Basic Authorities Act, 22 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2669(c), permitted the Department to exempt an employee from ADEA protections. Inter alia, the appellate court held that the second clause of 22 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2669(c) did not give the Department the authority to fire the employee solely because he turned sixty-five. Neither that clause; nor &sect; 408 of the Foreign Service Act, to which the Department claimed the clause referred, nor the further sections of the Foreign Service Act that &sect; 408 itself referenced, spoke with the kind of clarity one would expect if Congress had intended to remove the protections of landmark legislation like the ADEA from a class of U.S. citizens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court, granting the State Department's motion to dismiss the ADEA claim was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Columbia sentenced appellant to concurrent prison terms of 135 months for RICO conspiracy and armed bank robbery, 60 months for conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery, and a consecutive term of 360 months for using or carrying a machinegun during the robbery. After an appeal before the instant court, appellant sought rehearing en banc.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Only a single legal question remained: whether 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 924(c)(1)(B)(ii), which imposed a mandatory 30 year sentence for any person who carried a machinegun while committing a crime of violence, required the government to prove that a defendant knew the weapon he was carrying was capable of firing automatically. Appellant argued the government presented insufficient evidence to support his conviction under &sect; 924(c)(1)(B)(ii) because the government failed to show he knew the AK-47 he carried was capable of firing automatically. By claiming &sect; 924(c)(1)(B)(ii) contained an additional, implicit mens rea requirement, appellant asked the instant court to set aside a circuit precedent that governed its interpretation for 20 years. Appellant and his amici failed to establish that any intervening legal development weakened, much less removed, the conceptual underpinnings of the instant court's decision in Harris. It could not be said that Congress simply forgot about mens rea when it drafted &sect; 924(c); &sect; 924(c)(1)(B)(ii) did not require the government to prove that a defendant knew that the weapon he used, carried, or possessed was a machinegun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee United States sued appellants, cigarette manufacturers and organizations, for civil violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia imposed injunctions. The court affirmed all but four aspects of the order and remanded for further proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, Pub. L. No. 111-31, 123 Stat. 1776 (2009), deprived the district court of jurisdiction by eliminating any reasonable likelihood they would have committed future RICO violations. The court found that the Tobacco Control Act did not make it impossible to grant effectual relief because it did not make it impossible for appellants to commit future RICO violations. If appellants were not deterred by the possibility of RICO liability, appellants were not likely to be deterred by the Tobacco Control Act either. The district court maintained jurisdiction because it applied the correct legal standard, and did not clearly err in finding appellants still exhibited a reasonable likelihood of committing future RICO violations. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to vacate its injunctions under the primary jurisdiction doctrine because, while the Tobacco Control Act gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate much of appellants' conduct, it gave the FDA no particular insight into whether appellants were likely to comply with those restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner airlines sought review of final rules of the U.S. Department of Transportation final rule entitled Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections. 76 Fed. Reg. 23,110 (Apr. 25, 2011) as arbitrary and capricious, a violation of the First Amendment, and as procedurally defective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The airlines challenged a requirement that the most prominent figure displayed on print ads and websites be the total price, including taxes (Advertising Rule); a requirement that consumers who purchased tickets more than a week in advance be allowed to cancel reservations without penalty for twenty-four hours after purchase (Refund Rule); and a prohibition against increasing ticket and baggage fees after purchase (Price Rule). Inter alia, the court held that nothing in the Advertising Rule required airlines to hide the taxes. It just required that the total, final price be the most prominently listed figure. This was not an arbitrary exercise of DOT's authority to prevent unfair or deceptive practices, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 41712(a). The First Amendment plainly permitted a rule that simply regulated the manner of disclosure and imposed no burden on speech other than requiring disclosure of total price. The Refund Rule--developed as part of a systematic effort aimed at preventing unfair and deceptive practices--regulated, not airfares, but only cancellations, and was not arbitrary or capricious. The DOT was undertaking a new notice and comment procedure before enforcing the Price Rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner trade groups sought review of an Order of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) amending the interim cap rule, which limited at 2008 levels the amount of support available to competitive eligible telecommunications carriers (CETCs) through the High-Cost Universal Service Support Program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The FCC amended the interim cap rule to provide that when a carrier relinquished its eligible communications carrier status, the cap on support available in the carrier's state was reduced by the amount the relinquishing carrier would have received had it retained its status. Inter alia, the appellate court held that the order was a lawful exercise of FCC authority because the Universal Service Administration Company was no longer required to dispose of excess funds by lowering the next quarter's contribution factor and the waiver of 47 C.F.R. &sect; 54.709(b) did staunch the outflow of funds. What kept the inflow of funds above actual expenses each quarter was the directive to continue collecting contributions &quot;as if&quot; the cap had not been lowered. Each action was necessary to create the &quot;temporary reserve&quot; by setting the level of Program contributions higher than the level of Program disbursements. As interpreted by the FCC, the Act neither &quot;raised revenue&quot; under the Origination Clause nor delegated Congress's authority to &quot;lay and collect taxes&quot; in contravention of the Taxing Clause. So the constitutional avoidance canon gave no reason to reject the FCC's interpretation.</SPAN></P>

The parties sought review the decision for compliance with 17 U.S.C.S. &sect; 114(f)(2)(A). Inter alia, the court held that the CRJs, as currently established, were principal officers who had to be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and that the structure of the Copyright Royalty Board therefore violated the Appointments Clause. U.S. Const., art. II, &sect; 2, cl. 2. To remedy the violation, the court invalidated and severed the restrictions on the Librarian of Congress's ability to remove the CRJs. With such removal power in the Librarian's hands, the Judges were inferior rather than principal officers, and no constitutional problem remained. Because of the Appointments Clause violation at the time of decision, the court vacated and remanded the determination challenged here; accordingly it did not need to reach appellant's arguments regarding the merits of the rates and terms set in that determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the Board's structure was unconstitutional at the time it issued its determination, the court vacated and remanded the determination and did not address arguments regarding the merits of the rates set therein.</SPAN></P>

Both parties moved for summary judgment. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted the Department summary judgment in almost all respects. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the District Court, holding that the Compensation Regulations did not exceed Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), Pub. L. No. 89-329, 79 Stat. 1219, 123-254, limits, and mostly rejected the claim that the regulations were not based on reasoned decision making. The court remanded two aspects of the Compensation Regulations, however, that lacked adequate explanations. The court also held that the Misrepresentation Regulations exceeded the HEA's limits by allowing the Secretary of Education to take enforcement actions against schools sans procedural protections, proscribing misrepresentations as to subjects that were not covered by the HEA, and by proscribing statements that were merely confusing. The court rejected the remaining challenges to the Misrepresentation Regulations. With respect to the State Authorization Regulations, plaintiff had standing to challenge the school authorization regulation, but the court held that the regulation was valid. However, the court upheld the challenge to the distance education regulation, because that regulation was not a logical outgrowth of the Department's proposed rules.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part and the case was remanded to the district court with instructions to remand the challenged regulations to the Department of Education for reconsideration consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, nuclear power plant owners and operators, sought review of a determination by respondent Secretary of Energy which found that there was no basis for suspending, or otherwise adjusting, annual fees collected from them totaling some $750 million a year. The fees were intended to cover the full costs of the government's long-term disposal of civilian nuclear waste.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to petitioners, the Secretary's determination, made subsequent to the decision to discontinue development of the only designated location for the disposal of the waste, failed to examine the anticipated costs of disposal, or compare them to expected revenues from the fees in violation of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, which obliged the Secretary to annually evaluate whether collection of the fee would provide sufficient revenues to offset program costs. The court agreed that the Secretary failed to perform a valid evaluation, but the court did not think it appropriate to order the suspension of the fee at that time and instead concluded that a remand was appropriate. Although the Secretary had some discretion in the manner in which he calculated costs, the government's argument suggested the Secretary had no affirmative obligation to conduct the sort of inquiry and analysis done in the past.  The Secretary could not rely on the 2008 assessment's cost calculations for the former designated location as a proxy. Moreover, the 2010 determination was an unexplained departure from long-standing Department policy and arbitrary and capricious on that ground as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the matter to the Secretary to make a proper assessment within six months.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee, who worked for a division of the Library of Congress, sued, inter alia, defendant former supervisor, alleging that his termination for publication of articles critical of high-level public officials violated the First and Fifth Amendments and entitled him to damages under Bivens. Defendant moved to dismiss. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff criticized the system of military commissions created to prosecute suspected terrorists held at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, and officials who chose to prosecute some detainees in federal courts and others in military commissions. The court had previously held against applying the Bivens model to claims of First Amendment violations by federal employees. The court would not imply a Bivens remedy where Congress had adopted a comprehensive remedial scheme, and in the instant case, the scheme was the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA). The CSRA's remedial scheme provided procedural protections  and rights of appeal for the specific underlying actions that plaintiff challenged. The CSRA's lack of relief for plaintiff (due to his status as a probationary employee of a non-Executive agency) did not prevent the CSRA from being a comprehensive remedial scheme that precluded the court from creating a Bivens remedy. The CSRA's remedial scheme evinced a considered judgment of Congress that certain remedies were not warranted. The court gave appropriate judicial deference to that judgment and thus declined to create a Bivens remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of the district court denying defendant's motion to dismiss and remanded with instructions to dismiss plaintiff's Bivens claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county, a covered jurisdiction under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), sued defendant U.S. Attorney General, seeking both a declaratory judgment that VRA &sect;&sect; 4(b) and 5 were facially unconstitutional and a permanent injunction prohibiting the Attorney General from enforcing them.

In Northwest Austin, the U.S. Supreme Court signaled that the extraordinary federalism costs imposed by &sect; 5 raised substantial constitutional concerns. As a lower federal court urged to strike this duly enacted law of Congress, the appellate court proceeded with great caution, bound as it was by Supreme Court precedent and confined as it had to be to resolve only the precise legal question before it: Did the severe remedy of preclearance remain congruent and proportional? The legislative record was by no means unambiguous. But Congress drew reasonable conclusions from the extensive evidence it gathered and acted pursuant to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which entrusted Congress with ensuring that the right to vote--surely among the most important guarantees of political liberty in the Constitution--was not abridged on account of race. In this context, the court owed much deference to the considered judgment of the people's elected representatives, so it declined to find the legislation unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenors challenged the district court's interpretation of &sect; 201 (2 U.S.C.S. &sect; 434(f)(2)(E) &amp; (F)) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA). The court of appeals found that intervenors failed to make a strong showing that they were likely to succeed on the merits, nor did they demonstrate that they would be irreparably injured absent a stay. The plain text of &sect; 434(f)(2)(F) required disclosures to contain the names of all contributors who contributed an aggregate amount of $1,000 or more to a person purchasing &quot;electioneering communications.&quot; The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike a separate provision of the BCRA did not alter the interpretation in light of the BCRA's severability provision, 2 U.S.C.S. &sect; 454. The definition of &quot;contribution&quot; under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 was inapplicable. Intervenors provided no evidence that their contributors would face threats, harassment, or reprisals if their names were disclosed and therefore failed to demonstrate how the disclosure requirements would prevent them from speaking.</SPAN></P>

The United States District Court for the District of Columbia rejected the officers' claims of qualified immunity. The officers sought interlocutory review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed that the officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights by planning and conducting a 4:00 a.m. search on a warrant that did not authorize a nighttime search and breaking and entering into their home without knocking and announcing their presence. The district court rejected the officers' qualified immunity claims, finding that the failure to knock and announce before entering into plaintiffs' home and the nighttime search violated their clearly established rights under the Fourth Amendment. The question was whether plaintiffs' asserted rights were clearly established when the officers executed the search warrant. The appellate court held that, since the court found no controlling precedent or consensus of persuasive authority from other circuits, there was no clearly established law. As neither the no-knock entry of plaintiffs' home nor the nighttime search violated clearly established law, the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator sued defendant, her former employer, under the False Claims Act's qui tam and retaliation provisions, 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3730(b) &amp; (h). The government moved to dismiss the qui tam claims after reaching a settlement agreement with defendant. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted the motion over relator's objection and granted defendant summary judgment on the remaining retaliation claim. Relator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, hired to monitor defendant's governmental contract compliance, suspected defendant was violating price reduction clauses and regularly overcharging government agencies. She continued to investigate despite being told by a supervisor to stop doing so. Her employment eventually was terminated. The government declined to intervene in the qui tam action at first but pursued a settlement, pursuant to which it eventually intervened and moved to dismiss. Relator opposed the settlement and dismissal. Inter alia, the appellate court held that the settlement agreement fell within &sect; 3730(c)(2)(B), which gave the judiciary the final word on settlement decisions. The district court erred in dismissing without finding the settlement agreement fair, adequate, and reasonable. Relator's factual allegations were sufficient to overcome the presumption that she was merely acting in accordance with her employment obligations. She set forth a prima facie retaliation case and defendant presented an alternative, non-discriminatory basis for terminating her employment. So all that remained was the ultimate question of whether a reasonable jury could infer retaliation from all the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed on all counts and remanded for review of the settlement agreement pursuant to 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3730(c)(2)(B) and consideration of the parties' remaining summary judgment arguments on the &sect; 3730(h) retaliation claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff representatives of the estates of their deceased sons, brought an action against defendant federal officials seeking money damages relating to the alleged mistreatment and eventual death of those sons while they were detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the motion of the United States to be substituted as defendant and the motion of the United States for dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Beginning in January of 2002, the first decedent, a citizen of Saudi Arabia, and the second decedent, a citizen of Yemen, were detained at the United States military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as enemy combatants. On June 10 of 2006, both men, along with a third detainee, died. Although the cause of death was the subject of dispute, a Naval Criminal Investigative Service report concluded that the deaths were the result of suicide by hanging. The District Court, while recognizing that the plain language of 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2241(e)(2) precluded jurisdiction over claims by aliens who have been determined to be enemy combatants by the United States, decided to avoid the constitutional implications it saw in the jurisdictional question and instead reached the merits of the complaint and entered a dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The litigation plainly constituted an action other than habeas corpus brought against the United States and its agents relating to aspects of the detention treatment and conditions of confinement of an alien as described in 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2241(e)(1) and (2). Therefore, the action was excluded from the jurisdiction of the court by an Act of Congress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed although for lack of jurisdiction rather than failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>

Respondent EPA agreed to petitioners' fees once they prevailed. Intervenors then moved for their fees and costs under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7607(f) of the Clean Air Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenors entered the litigation on the side of petitioners, not the government, and they offered two substantial arguments based on the EPA's alleged failure to consider intervenors' treaty rights, arguments that petitioners lacked standing to make. Although the court never reached intervenors' arguments, that was immaterial. By giving the court alternative bases for resolving the case--bases petitioners were unable to offer--the intervenors contributed to the proper implementation and administration of the Act or otherwise served the public interest. The EPA's view, embraced by the dissent--that the court should allow fee shifting only where an intervenor affected the outcome of a case as determined after the fact--would have discouraged interventions that played a useful role. Intervenors wasted no time duplicating petitioners' arguments. Instead, they focused on arguments that petitioners did not and could not make. In the court's view, their contribution was precisely the type that &sect; 7607(f) sought to incentivize.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of multiple convictions, petitioner inmate was serving an aggregate life sentence imposed by District of Columbia courts. He filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia which dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction, reasoning that the inmate was required to pursue his challenge in D.C. Superior Court rather than federal court. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the exact nature of the inmate's constitutional claims was not clear, they involved actual innocence coupled with a constitutional violation and miscarriage of justice and other due process and equal protection of law claims. The reason the inmate provided for not being able to bring these constitutional claims under D.C. Code &sect; 23-110(a) was that his actual innocence allegations were tethered to alleged constitutional violations and accordingly, in light of caselaw, the Innocence Protection Act, D.C. Code &sect; 22-4131 et seq., provided the exclusive judicial remedy for District of Columbia offenders who obtain new evidence of actual innocence more than three years after they are convicted. However, this was a misreading of caselaw. The circuit court concluded that jurists of reason would not find the inmate's claim that the district court had jurisdiction debatable. In essence this was because caselaw could not reasonably be read to bar the inmate from bringing his federal constitutional claims in D.C. Superior Court under D.C. Code &sect; 23-110. Accordingly the certificate of appealability was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, citizens and taxpayers, appealed an order from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejecting their constitutional challenge to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and denying their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. Appellants argued in particular that the minimum essential coverage provision found at 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5000A exceeded Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a threshold matter, the court rejected any challenge to its subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the Anti-Injunction Act did not, by its terms, cover the shared responsibility payment provision for not complying with the individual mandate under the term &quot;any tax.&quot; Congress did not intend for &quot;any tax&quot; to include exactions unrelated to taxes that Congress labeled &quot;penalties.&quot; The court read the shared responsibility payment under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5000A(g)(1) as not implicating the Anti-Injunction Act. As for the Commerce Clause challenge, it was irrelevant that an indeterminate number of healthy, uninsured persons would never consume health care and would therefore never affect the interstate market. Congress reasonably determined that as a class, the uninsured created market failures; thus, the lack of harm attributable to any particular uninsured individual, like their lack of overt participation in a market, was of no consequence. The right to be free from federal regulation was not absolute, and yielded to the imperative that Congress be free to forge national solutions to national problems, no matter how local--or seemingly passive--their individual origins.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged, both facially and as applied to them, the provisions of the District of Columbia's gun laws, new and old, requiring the registration of firearms and prohibiting both the registration of assault weapons and the possession of magazines with a capacity of more than ten rounds of ammunition. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted summary judgment for the District and the plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs argued the provisions (1) were not within the District's congressionally delegated legislative authority or, if they were, then they (2) violated the Second Amendment. The appellate court held that the District had the authority under D.C. law to promulgate the challenged gun laws. Using the Heller framework, the court upheld the requirement of mere registration because it was longstanding and hence, presumptively lawful, and the presumption stood unrebutted. The court also applied intermediate scrutiny to uphold as constitutional the prohibitions of assault weapons and of large-capacity magazines. However, the court remanded the other registration requirements to the district court for further proceedings because the record was insufficient to inform its resolution of the important constitutional issues presented.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the district court with respect to the handgun registration requirement and the ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. With respect to the registration requirements as applied to long guns, the judgment was vacated and this matter remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendants, the United States and the District of Columbia, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the constitutionality of the District of Columbia Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 22-4001 to 22-4017. The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to enactment of SORA, plaintiff was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape. He argued that SORA's sex offender registration requirement as applied to him violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. The court of appeals held that there was no ex post facto violation because SORA was civil and nonpunitive in nature. SORA was intended by the District of Columbia Council to be nonpunitive; significantly, the work of SORA was assigned to an administrative agency. SORA also was not punitive in purpose or effect. Sex offender registration schemes had not been traditionally regarded as a punishment, and allowing the police to notify the community of plaintiff's status did not make SORA excessive with respect to its civil and nonpunitive purpose. Plaintiff also alleged that his Fifth Amendment rights were violated because he was forced to participate in polygraph examinations and psychotherapy sessions, but he did not allege that he was exposed to the threat of incrimination, was compelled to testify, or asserted his privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six defendants were charged in a 158-count superseding indictment upon which the defendants were tried by a United States District Court for the District of Columbia jury and convicted on multiple charges, including drug conspiracy, Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act conspiracy, continuing criminal enterprise, murder, and other related charges in violation of federal and District of Columbia laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants and other separately tried co-conspirators conspired and conducted an ongoing drug distribution business. In the course of conducting that business, various co-conspirators committed a wide-ranging course of violence, including 31 murders. They asserted a variety of alleged errors including evidentiary issues, both as to admission and sufficiency; conduct of the trial; prosecutorial misconduct; and jury instructions. Upon review, the appellate court concluded that most of the asserted errors either were not erroneous or were harmless. As to one category of issue involving alleged Confrontation Clause violations, an intervening Supreme Court decision compelled remand of the convictions of some drug charges. On one defendant's claim that his counsel erroneously believed there was a Bruton problem and therefore failed to call an important witness, the record was inconclusive as to whether the allegations reflected counsel's informed tactical choice or a decision undertaken out of ignorance of the relevant law. Thus, the claim was remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing. The appellate court also vacated one murder conviction that merged with another.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed all of defendant's convictions except a murder conviction that merged with another count, which it vacated, two counts which the court remanded for an evidentiary hearing and to address the ineffective assistance of counsel claim; and several counts involving alleged Confrontation Clause violations, which it remanded for consideration in light of intervening U.S. Supreme Court caselaw.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner trade associations representing commercial ship owners and operators petitioned for review of the final action establishing a Vessel General Permit pursuant to &sect; 402 (33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1342) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1251 et seq., by respondent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the discharge of pollutants incidental to the normal operation of vessels.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners' contended that the EPA failed to provide notice and an opportunity for comment before promulgating the final permit, as required by 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 553. The EPA did provide for notice and comment regarding the draft VGP, but the petitioners argued that this was insufficient because the draft contained only the general EPA-mandated conditions for vessel discharges, but none of the more than 100 state certification conditions that were appended to the final permit. Petitioners alleged that they were therefore deprived of the opportunity to comment regarding the cumulative effects of the state conditions. The court held that petitioners failed to establish that the EPA could alter or reject state certification conditions. Thus, the additional agency procedures they demanded would not have afforded them the relief they sought. The agency correctly concluded that it could not amend or reject conditions in a state's CWA &sect; 401 (33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1341) certification. Therefore, providing notice and an opportunity for comment on the state certifications would have served no purpose, and the court declined to remand to require EPA to do a futile thing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Facts found by the district court were alone sufficient to conclude that petitioner was part of al Qaeda or the Taliban forces where petitioner, a Yemeni citizen, traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan specifically to join the Taliban's fight against the Northern Alliance, stayed in at least three guesthouses closely associated with the Tlaiban and/or al Qaeda, surrendered his passport as other al Qaeda and Taliban recruits did, received training at a Taliban-related training camp, and joined a Taliban combat unit with which he fought. It was neither clear error nor abuse of discretion for the district court's determination that petitioner's own admissions, which petitioner claimed were uncorroborated and which the district court largely relied on to establish underlying facts, were reliable. So the appellate court rejected petitioner's contention that the record before the district court was insufficient to establish the lawfulness of his detention. While the district court's denial of a thirty-day continuance was hard to understand, because petitioner's attorneys had adequate time to prepare and petitioner failed to show actual prejudice, it was not error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff local candidate, claiming entitlement to run under a new nonpartisan system that had not received &sect; 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 preclearance, sued defendant U.S. Attorney General from enforcing &sect; 5. Count 1 argued &sect; 5 exceeded the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment. Count 2 argued a facially unconstitutional racial-preference scheme. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed. The candidate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate sufficiently alleged a risk of suffering concrete and particularized injuries to 2 judicially cognizable interests: that the partisan election regime made getting on the ballot more costly and time consuming and that it provided a competitive advantage to his Democratic opponents. Voters adopted nonpartisan elections, thus, he had a cognizable interest in reaping the asserted benefits of that system. His allegation of intending to run in the next election and his announcement to do so the day he filed suit showed a substantial probability of imminent injury for standing. Because &sect; 5 prevented the city from carrying out its state-law duty to implement the nonpartisan referendum, he had both standing and a cause of action to seek declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that it exceeded Congress's enumerated powers. Standing on Count 2's equal-protection claim raised issues that had received little attention: if &sect; 1973c(b)-(d) were held unconstitutional, would &sect; 1973c(a) be left untouched, what remedy was sought, and if redressability depended on whether the city sought reconsideration of the preclearance decision. On remand, those issues were to be considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal was reversed and remanded for consideration of the merits of Count 1. The dismissal was vacated as to Count 2 and Count 2 was remanded for further consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">TSA's fees charged to the airlines for screening operations could not exceed the amount that airlines paid for screening passengers and property during the year 2000, pursuant to 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 44940(a)(2)(B)(i). According to the airlines, TSA's decisions were arbitrary and capricious because TSA should not have relied on a particular report commissioned by TSA, or at least should have more fully explained why it rejected the conclusions of the alternative report submitted by the airlines. The court stated that its deference to the agency was particularly strong because the statute stated that the fee was based on the amount TSA &quot;determined&quot; the airlines paid in 2000. Given the choice between the two reports, TSA chose the report it commissioned with good reason, and certainly sufficient reason that the court could not overturn that decision on Administrative Procedure Act arbitrary and capricious review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that petitioners' claim challenging the DOE's attempt to withdraw its construction license application from consideration by the Commission was not ripe for judicial determination because (1) the claim was unfit for judicial decision because, at this stage of the administrative process, the DOE had no say in whether the license application would have been reviewed and granted; and (2) petitioners' interest in prompt consideration of allegedly unlawful agency action would have been only minimally harmed by delay. Petitioners' challenge to the DOE's apparent decision to abandon development of the nuclear waste repository was not reviewable by the court because, inter alia, petitioners set forth no discrete action mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 10101-10270, that the DOE failed to perform or performed inadequately; the DOE's policy announcement was not a final decision or action of the Secretary or a final agency action as required by 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 10139(a)(1)(A) and 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 704; and the DOE had not failed to take any discrete agency action that Congress ordered it to take.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 702 lifted the bar of sovereign immunity in actions not seeking money damages. No exception existed shielding the IRS from suit under the APA. I.R.C. &sect; 7421(a) prohibited only those suits seeking to restrain the assessment or collection of taxes; the taxpayers' suit did not seek to restrain the assessment or collection of any tax. The assessment and collection were long-since completed and no single mechanism theory could revive them. I.R.C. 7421(a) applied only when Congress provided an alternative avenue for an aggrieved party to litigate its claims. A refund suit was not an alternative avenue for the taxpayers. &quot;With respect to Federal taxes&quot; in the Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA), 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2201(a), meant with respect to the assessment or collection of taxes. Section &sect; 702's waiver of sovereign immunity permitted the action and neither &sect; 7421(a) nor the DJA otherwise limited review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The detainees claimed that they were held at U.S. military facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan and suffered torture and abuse, including beatings, sexual assaults, and deprivation of sleep, food, and water. The court of appeals held that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity as to the detainees' constitutional claims, as it was not clearly established at the time of the alleged conduct that the detainees had any Fifth or Eighth Amendment rights. Also, allowing the detainees' claims to proceed would have presented a danger of obstructing national security policy. Because defendants were acting within the scope of their employment, the detainees' ATS claims were properly restyled as claims against the U.S. that were governed by the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1346, 2671 et seq., and the detainees failed to exhaust administrative remedies as the FTCA required. The ATS claim did not fall within the exception under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2679(b)(2)(B) for statutory violations by federal employees; the ATS was strictly a jurisdictional statute and did not trigger the exception. The detainees' claim alleged a violation of the law of nations, not of a U.S. statute.</SPAN></P>

An officer confiscated the protestor's chalk and directed him to stop. The appellate court determined that the Defacement Statute was not unconstitutional as applied because (1) the District's interest in controlling the esthetic appearance of the street in front of the White House was substantial, (2) the Defacement Statute was sufficiently tailored to serve the District's esthetic interest, and (3) the District's threatened use of the Defacement Statute left him with alternative channels of communication since the District granted him approval to conduct an assembly in front of the White House. The protestor's overbreadth challenge failed because he could not show any &quot;realistic danger&quot; the Defacement Statute actually chilled constitutionally protected speech. The protestor's RFRA claim failed because he could still spread his message through picketing, a public prayer vigil, or other similar activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The transferee claimed he could not be transferred to the custody of Iraqi officials because he was likely to be tortured after his transfer. The U.S. Executive Branch maintained that this was not likely. The appellate court held that habeas corpus and due process did not give petitioner a right to judicial review of conditions in the receiving country. Congress was free to establish additional statutory protections with respect to transfers, whether to correspond to U.S. laws or evolving international law norms or for other policy reasons. Indeed, Congress had done so in the immigration context by allowing aliens in removal proceedings to obtain judicial review of conditions in the receiving country before being transferred. But Congress had not created such a right for extradition or military transferees. As petitioner was a military transferee and not an alien seeking review of a final order of removal under the immigration laws, the FARR Act did not afford him any right to judicial review of conditions in the receiving country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner trade association sought review of a final rule of the Occupational Safety &amp;Health Administration (OSHA) promulgated pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 651-678, conserning the final vertical tandem lift (VTL) Standard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trade association disagreed with OSHA's vertical tandem lift (VTL) Standard, arguing that (1) OSHA failed to show VTLs posed a significant worker safety risk; (2) two of the Standard's requirements were not technologically feasible; (3) the Standard was not reasonably necessary or appropriate in light of the &quot;safe work zone&quot; requirement; (4) OSHA's authority was limited to requiring, not prohibiting, workplace practices; and (5) the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 651-678, made an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to OSHA. The court held that, as neither the OSH Act nor precedent unambiguously foreclosed the agency's reasonable interpretation, OSHA met its burden regarding the significant risk determination. However, the Standard was almost devoid of a feasibility analysis, containing only a bare conclusion that because all of the conditions imposed could be met by stevedores, and in fact most were being met where VTLs were currently being performed, the Standard was technologically feasible. The record lacked substantial evidence to support the feasibility of 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1917.71(i)(9) in part and of &sect; 1917.71(i)(10).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the trade association's petition in part, vacating and remanding the Standard with respect to the inspection requirement for ship-to-shore vertical tandem lifts and the total ban on platform container vertical tandem lifts. Otherwise, it denied the petition.</SPAN></P>

He also alleged that defendants, a former employer and a former union, violated a state age discrimination law. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the suit and the pilot appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pilot asserted it was possible for the airlines to avoid the FTEPA's nonretroactivity provision by temporarily demoting a pilot to required flight deck crew member when he turned 60, waiting for Congress to pass the FTEPA, and then promoting him to pilot. On appeal, the pilot argued that the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (NJLAD), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-12, entitled him to such a temporary demotion. The pilot's concession to the district court that the FTEPA preempted his NJLAD claims was fatal to his appeal. No doubt recognizing that, he argued for the first time on appeal that the FTEPA did not preempt the claim he advanced on appeal: that the employer violated NJLAD by failing to temporarily demote him to required flight deck crew member so that he could take advantage of the newly enacted and higher age limit. Regardless of whether the Federal Rules' liberal pleading standard would have permitted the pilot to assert his failure-to-demote theory without amending his complaint, he failed to do so. As a result, neither defendants nor the district court had notice of the type of NJLAD claim that the pilot asserted on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff national trade associations alleged that the Murray Amendment, Pub. Law No. 111-117, &sect; 172 (2009), violated the First Amendment petition and Fifth Amendment equal protection rights of their members, private charter bus operators. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia agreed and ordered defendant Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to enforce the Charter Rule, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5323(d)(1). The FTA appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Murray Amendment and subsequent enactments ensured that the FTA did not spend appropriated funds to enforce the Charter Rule against any public transportation system providing bus service to Seattle Mariners baseball games through the end of fiscal year 2011. Only one entity satisfied the Murray Amendment's criteria. According to the trade associations, this compromised their members' right to petition the FTA under 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5323(d)(2), and thus violated the First Amendment. There was no constitutional violation, however, because the trade associations and their members remained free to speak and petition in favor of barring the special bus service. All the Murray Amendment did was limit the FTA's authority to enforce such a bar. The trade associations also charged that the Murray Amendment violated equal protection by singling out its members for special treatment. But the Murray Amendment was rationally related to the legitimate governmental goals of accommodating handicapped fans, restoring more affordable service, and reducing traffic on game days, and thus readily passed muster under the applicable rational-basis test. Thus, there was no violation of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a cable operator and a video programmer, argued respondent Federal Communications Commission (FCC) exceeded its 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 548 authority in its 2010 Order by extending its program access rules to terrestrially delivered programming, that the FCC's rules violated the First Amendment, and that certain features of the rules run afoul of &sect; 548, the Administrative Procedure Act, and/or the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because &sect; 548(c)(2) established a floor rather than a ceiling, the FCC's reliance on &sect; 548(b), (c)(1), to regulate conduct that &sect; 548(c)(2) left unrestricted did not contravene congressional intent. For similar reasons, the argument that by leaving terrestrial programmers off the list of entities covered by &sect; 548(b) Congress unambiguously placed terrestrially delivered programming beyond FCC jurisdiction was rejected. A prior regression analysis was substantial evidence supporting the presumption the &sect; 548(c)(2)-like conduct involving regional terrestrial programming would significantly hinder the provision of satellite cable programming. There was absolutely no evidence, nor even any serious suggestion, that the FCC issued its regulations to disfavor certain messages or ideas; the First Amendment challenge failed. But, the FCC had to consider if there were relevant differences between satellite and terrestrial programming before invoking Congress's regulation of satellite withholding as a justification for treating terrestrial withholding as categorically unfair.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitions for review were denied in part and granted in part. The court vacated that portion of the Commission's order treating certain acts of terrestrially delivered programming withholding as categorically unfair and remanded to the Commission for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for unlawful possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 922(g). Despite his repeated requests for a speedy trial, his case had languished in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for 14 months before trial finally began. The district court had relied on a government's Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) motion to suspend operation of the Speedy Trial Act's 70-day time limit, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3161(c)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) filing, the government indicated that it intended to use evidence of the circumstances surrounding defendant's prior conviction for the same crime -- unlawful possession of a firearm -- as evidence that his possession of the seized weapon was knowing and intentional, not due to accident or mistake. At a status conference held on the ninety-third day following indictment (the eighty-ninth day on the Speedy Trial Act clock) defense counsel told the district court that he had not yet filed a motion to suppress the seized evidence and defendant's statement (unrelated to the prosecutor's Rule 404(b) filing) because of an unexpected delay in obtaining a needed transcript. Although the prosecutor raised Speedy Trial Act concerns, the district court stated that the Rule 404(b) filing had tolled the statute. Although defendant raised his ineffective assistance of pretrial counsel claim for the first time on appeal, the record sufficed to decide the issue and a remand was unnecessary. Defendant's pretrial counsel fell below standard in failing to object to the exclusion of the Rule 404(b) filing time in the Speedy Trial Act calculation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was vacated because defendant was denied his right under the Sixth Amendment to the effective assistance of pretrial counsel, and the case was remanded to determine whether dismissal for violation of the Speedy Trial Act should be with or without prejudice to his re-prosecution.</SPAN></P>

Syria did not respond, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered default judgment in favor of the families. Syria moved to vacate the default judgment under Fed. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Syria argued that it never received service of process because the mail carrier did not deliver it.

The court found that Syria's factual argument that the carrier's letter was a fraud was speculative. The district court did not clearly err in finding that Syria received service of process under the FSIA. The families adequately effected service of process against Syria when they first filed suit under former 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1605(a)(7) of the FSIA. Before the district court entered judgment, the families moved to convert their action and proceed under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1605A in accordance with &sect; 1083 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA), Pub. L. No. 110-181, 122 Stat. 3 (2008). Under &sect; 1083 of the NDAA, the families did not have to serve Syria anew because the statutory text did not treat converted claims as new claims for relief.

The citizen argued he suffers continuing, adverse effects sufficient to support standing because the Government denied and continued to deny him the ability to purchase a firearm. More specifically, he argued the Government denied him the ability to buy a firearm by requiring that he reside in a state as a condition of making such a purchase. The circuit court agreed with the citizen that the Government had denied him the ability to purchase a firearm and he thereby suffered an ongoing injury. The Government could not avoid suit merely by erecting a regulatory scheme that precluded the citizen from truthfully completing the application form the Government required for the purchase of a firearm. The citizen had raised a constitutional challenge under the Second Amendment to the regulatory and statutory classifications that barred him from acquiring a firearm. His desire to purchase a firearm was sufficiently actual and imminent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff pilot filed suit against defendant U.S. Coast Guard and others (collectively the Government), challenging the Coast Guard's determination to terminate his appointment as an unaffiliated, independent pilot; he claimed violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), as well as his First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the Government summary judgment. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from a previous appeal in the case, the Coast Guard held that, a &quot;voluntary association&quot; under 46 U.S.C.S. &sect; 9304 referred to a group of people joined together for a certain purpose, and not a legal entity distinct from the persons who are members, and, therefore, the pilot had no right to serve as an independent pilot during the 2004 navigation season, because, as of December 2003, a regional pilots' association appeared to have a sufficient number of pilots to provide pilotage service for the upcoming season. The Coast Guard's interpretation of the term &quot;voluntary association&quot; in &sect; 9304 easily survived review under Chevron Step Two. The pilot's First Amendment claim was barred by issue preclusion because the Second Circuit had ruled against him on the same issue in a suit against the regional pilots' association. In any event, the claim failed on the merits. The Coast Guard did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in determining that the pilot's dispatch as an independent pilot expired after the 2003 season. The pilot's Fifth Amendment due process claim was rejected, because he had no constitutionally protected entitlement to continued dispatch by the Coast Guard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor sued defendants, the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) and officials, alleging that the termination of her contract violated her First Amendment free speech and Fifth Amendment equal protection rights. The officials moved to dismiss on several grounds, including qualified immunity. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia denied the motions to dismiss. The officials filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor's primary duties were to translate material into Farsi and to provide &quot;voice-over&quot; services. When the contractor appeared in a music video that criticized the United States' involvement in Iraq, the BBG terminated her contract. Defendants contended that the BBG's interest in promoting the efficiency of its provision of public services, and more specifically, in providing the level and sort of service dictated by statute, outweighed the contractor's interest in speaking through the video and the public's interest in hearing that speech. The appellate court determined that the district court did not err in denying the officials' motions for dismissal based on qualified immunity because (1) the contractor stated a claim for violation of her First Amendment rights, (2) the appellate court was unable to determine without an evidentiary record whether any act the BBG committed in defense of its governmental functions constituted a violation of clearly established rights, or even in general terms, where the Pickering balancing tipped, and (3) her complaint was susceptible to the interpretation that her contract was terminated &quot;because of&quot; her ethnicity or national origin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an institutional investment manager that wished to purchase stock and was subject to the disclosure requirements of 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 78m(f)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, brought suit against respondent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to challenge the disclosure requirements as violative of the First Amendment and as constituting a taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was not yet certain that petitioner needed to comply with &sect; 78m(f)(1); the SEC could have granted it confidential treatment or an exemption. If it did, the constitutional issue would not need to be resolved. Petitioner's allegedly proprietary information had not been disclosed publicly, and petitioner had not yet suffered any hardship from the requirements. When and if an exemption or confidential treatment were denied, petitioner could still seek judicial review of the SEC's decision before its filings were made public. Thus, neither the First Amendment nor Fifth Amendment challenges were ripe. As for the merits of petitioner's claim that its inability to control what the SEC did with the information it disclosed was a form of compelled speech, mere disclosure to the SEC did not raise First Amendment concerns. The requirements had a rational basis and did not require petitioner to endorse or acknowledge positions that were anathema to it. There was no public audience. Nor did disclosure raise Fifth Amendment concerns under Ruckleshaus even assuming petitioner had a cognizable property interest in knowledge of its investment positions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the constitutional challenge to the regulations as unripe, and the court denied the challenges to the disclosure of information to the SEC as compelled speech and as a regulatory tacking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Provider Reimbursement Review Board held that the investment limitations in Centers for Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual &sect; 2162.2.A.4 were a valid extension of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1395x(v)(1)(A) and the regulations governing reasonable cost. The district court found that the Board's adherence to the Manual's interpretation was not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the statute or the regulation. The question was whether the Manual's investment limitations for offshore captives was an interpretive rule. Section 1395x(v)(1)(A) gave the Secretary authority to promulgate regulations defining the method or methods to be used, and the items to be included, in determining what constituted a provider's reasonable costs. The court found that there was no way an interpretation of reasonable costs could have produced the sort of detailed--and rigid--investment code set forth in &sect; 2162.2.A.4. The connection between &sect; 2162.2.A.4 and reasonable costs was simply too attenuated to represent an interpretation of those terms as used in &sect; 1395x(v)(1)(A) and the regulations. Section 2162.2.A.4 could not have been sustained as a valid interpretation of reasonable cost.</SPAN></P>

Reversing as to one defendant, the court agreed that the district court erred in admitting evidence acquired by the warrantless use of a GPS device to track that defendant's movements continuously for a month. The court held that United States v. Knotts did not govern the case and the police action was a search because it defeated defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy. Without the GPS data, the evidence that defendant was actually involved in the conspiracy was so far from &quot;overwhelming&quot; that the court held that the Government had not carried its burden of showing the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff almond producers and retailers sued defendant U.S. Department of Agriculture, arguing that 7 C.F.R. &sect; 981.442(b), promulgated under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937(AMAA), 7 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 601-674, was arbitrary and capricious, exceeded agency statutory authority, and violated procedural requirements. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the suit. The producers and retailers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rule required use of approved methods for reducing salmonella bacteria in almonds, all involving either pasteurization or chemical treatment. 7 C.F.R. &sect; 981.442(b). The current dispute arose because the rule had the effect of largely eliminating the domestic raw almond market. Inter alia, the appellate court held that the AMAA did not preclude producer suits challenging rules and orders issued under it. Indeed, precluding producers' suits would effectively undermine the presumption in favor of judicial review that the U.S. Supreme Court had consistently reaffirmed. The government's argument that handlers could sue and that was good enough for producers was inconsistent with bedrock tenets of administrative law. However, the retailers' argument that the regulation improperly required them to exhaust administrative remedies was a challenge to the agency's exhaustion requirement that had to be raised first to the agency. As the retailers' administrative remedies were not exhausted, the district court properly dismissed their claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the judgment of the district court with respect to the suit of the ten producers, so their claims could go forward. The appellate court affirmed the district court's judgment dismissing the claims of the three producer-retailers, which first had to be raised first to the Department of Agriculture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of various federal drug and conspiracy offenses. He appealed his three concurrent 20-year sentences and $ 1,000 fine, arguing that the United States District Court for the District of Columbia failed to observe the requirements of 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 851(a) and (b) when it enhanced his sentence based on a prior drug conviction and that it levied a vindictive fine on him in violation of his constitutional due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant failed to preserve his 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 851(a) and vindictive sentence claims before the district court, those claims were subject to plain error review. The inclusion of a co-defendant's name in the body of the &sect; 851(a) pre-trial information instead of his own did not render the information invalid under &sect; 851(a). It was undisputed that the prosecutor filed and served in a timely manner an information detailing defendant's prior convictions. Thus, the prosecutor strictly complied with &sect; 851(a)'s requirements. Defendant failed to show prejudice. Under a de novo standard of review for defendant's &sect; 851(b) claim, the district court erred by not conducting the required colloquy, and the government conceded as much. However, the government carried its burden of showing that the error did not substantially harm defendant by affecting his sentence. At no point had defendant indicated that the drug conviction on which his sentence enhancement depended was invalid in any way. Defendant unsuccessfully argued that the imposition of the fine at resentencing created a presumption of vindictiveness since the district court had not imposed a fine in his original sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia sexual exploitation of a minor, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2251(a); transportation of a minor to engage in prostitution, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2423(a); and first degree child sexual abuse, D.C. Code &sect; 22-3008. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment followed by supervised release. On appeal he challenged his sentence, including several special conditions of his release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that his lawyers should have had him evaluated by a mental health expert before he was sentenced, but his claim of ineffective assistance failed because he had not raised a colorable claim of prejudice under the second prong of Strickland. Because defendant did not oppose the challenged supervised release conditions at any point--not in his sentencing memorandum, not in allocution before the sentence was pronounced, and not after it was imposed--the circuit court reviewed for plain error under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b). Defendant did not use a computer to facilitate his crimes. The government did not recommend that the court impose any supervised release conditions related to computers, but the Probation Office did. Neither the Probation Office nor the district court explained its reasons for restricting defendant's computer access. Not knowing the court's reasons for imposing these conditions, finding the government's reasons unsupported by the record, and unable to identify any itself, an appellate court vacated the conditions as plainly out of sync with the relevant factors and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supervised release conditions that required defendant to allow the monitoring of his computer use and to maintain a daily log of all addresses accessed by way of any computer, other than those authorized for employment, were vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After reviewing an administrative record with both classified and unclassified information, the Secretary denied the petition.

However, a review was not sufficient to supply otherwise absent due process protection of notice to the organization and an opportunity for a meaningful hearing, which did not happen here. Petitioner was notified of the decision and permitted access to the unclassified portion of the record only after the decision was final. Even though petitioner was given the opportunity to include in the record its own evidence supporting delisting, it had no opportunity to rebut the unclassified portion of the record the Secretary was compiling. Despite the Secretary's claims, there was no basis for relaxing due process requirements and the failure to provide required notice and unclassified material in advance of the decision was not harmless. The court left the designation in place but remanded with instructions to provide petitioner the opportunity to review and rebut the unclassified portions of the record on which the Secretary relied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his next friend contended that the preponderance of the evidence standard employed by the district court was unconstitutional, that it was error to admit hearsay evidence, and that the evidence was insufficient to show that the detainee was part of al Qaeda and Taliban forces. The appellate court held that the law of the circuit was that a preponderance of the evidence standard was constitutional in considering a habeas petition from an alien detained pursuant to AUMF authority. Decisions of the instant court and the Supreme Court established that in this type of habeas proceeding, hearsay evidence was admissible if reliable, which the disputed evidence was. The record strongly supported the district court's finding that defendant was part of al Qaeda and Taliban forces. He traveled to Afghanistan on a series of one-way plane tickets purchased with cash. Once there, he located and followed a Taliban official, spent time at a Taliban training camp, did what the official recommended to him, including giving up his passport and other possessions, obtaining an AK-47 rifle, and participating in a march with armed men that was attacked by United States and allied warplanes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a federal employee who suffered a work-related injury and her husband, sued defendant, the U.S. Department of Labor, after the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) issued a decision that plaintiffs were to reimburse to defendant its subrogation interest from a settlement received from third-parties. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted summary judgment to defendant. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) found that the settlement proceeds were jointly paid to both plaintiffs, that the husband was entitled to retain 25% for his loss of consortium, and that defendant was due a payment in an amount less that what it had paid to plaintiff in benefits. Plaintiff wife, as a beneficiary of benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 8101 et seq., was required to reimburse defendant for those payments. Clearly, the settlement was for the joint benefit of both plaintiffs, not just the husband for his loss of consortium. Defendant's 25% allocation for loss of consortium was neither unauthorized nor arbitrary; it was by the book. Defendant was not estopped from seeking reimbursement because it did not actively participate in the litigation against the third parties. A requirement that defendant participate in litigation in order to preserve its reimbursement rights would have been inconsistent with one of the purposes of FECA's reimbursement scheme. Finally, defendant's denial of certain costs to plaintiff's lawyer as not litigation-related was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a pharmaceutical plant owner and its principal, appealed the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which dismissed its claims against defendant, the United States of America. Plaintiffs brought suit seeking a declaration that the United States violated international law and asserted claims for defamation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1998, plaintiffs' pharmaceutical plant was destroyed following a missile strikes conducted by the United States after two foreign embassies were bombed. President William Clinton had ordered the missile strikes. Plaintiffs' request for compensation from the Central Intelligence Agency was denied and they filed the underlying action. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that international law was violated by the United States failing to compensate them for the unjustified destruction of their property. Plaintiffs also claimed that they were defamed by President Clinton and senior officials, who linked them to international terrorism. The court upheld the district court's dismissal of the action based on the political question doctrine. The court held that the case at hand involved the decision to launch a military strike abroad, which raised nonjusticiable political questions. The court noted that the defamation claim similarly required the court to determine the factual validity of the Government's stated reasons for the strike. The court determined that it could not assess the merits of President Clinton's decision to launch an attack on a foreign target.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The U.S. Supreme Court remanded for a determination of what  proceedings were necessary for the full and prompt disposition of the case in light of new developments. The new developments the Court identified included the fact that all 17 detainees had received at least one offer of resettlement in another country, and 12 had accepted an offer. The remaining five rejected three offers and were still being held at Guantanamo Bay. On remand, and after oral argument, the appellate court held that even if the remaining five detainees had good reason to reject the offers, they had no legal right to be released into the United States. In addition, an intervening opinion of the appellate court precluded the sort of judicial inquiry the detainees sought. It was for the political branch, not the courts, to determine whether a foreign country was appropriate for resettlement. Intervening congressional legislation prohibiting the expenditure of funds to bring any Guantanamo detainee to the United States did not violate the Suspension Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, cl. 2, nor was such legislation an unlawful bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, three detainees at a U.S. military base in Afghanistan, appealed a judgment from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denying them habeas corpus relief from confinement as unlawful enemy combatants. The district court had certified the suit for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1292(b). Appellant government filed a petition for an interlocutory appeal pursuant to that certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The detainees were citizens of Yemen and Tunisia who were captured in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Thailand and held as military prisoners at a U.S. Air Force Base in Afghanistan. The district court held that &sect; 7(a) of the of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-366, 120 Stat. 2600 (2006), purported to deprive the court of jurisdiction, but that it did not constitutionally apply to deprive the court of jurisdiction under the U.S. Supreme Court's test in Boumediene v. Bush. Considering the jurisdictional question on interlocutory appeal, the court applied the three-factor Boumediene v. Bush test and held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the petitions for habeas corpus. The jurisdiction of the courts to afford the right to habeas relief and the protection of the Suspension Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, cl. 2, did not extend to aliens held in Executive detention in a military detention facility in the Afghan theater of war. The government did not exercise de jure sovereignty over the air base--unlike on its base on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba--but held the detainees pursuant to a cooperative arrangement with Afghanistan on sovereign Afghan territory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the district court and ordered that the detainees' petitions for habeas corpus be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The shippers claimed that the railroad's rates for coal shipments were unreasonable under the Board's stand-alone-cost test, which required design of a hypothetical stand-alone railroad (SARR). The proceedings were held in abeyance while the Board developed new methodologies for evaluating rates, which applied retroactively. The shippers then redesigned their SARR, and the Board found that the railroad's rates were unreasonable. The railroad claimed that the proceeding should have been dismissed because the three-year time limit under 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11701(c) expired prior to the Board's decision. The court of appeals held that the railroad forfeited the three-year limit argument by failing to timely raise it before the Board; the railroad did not raise the issue until after the three-year period had purportedly run. The Board's decision to allow the shippers to redesign their SARR by rerouting traffic was not arbitrary and capricious, as the decision was consistent with Board precedent. However, the Board did not specifically address the railroad's objection that the Board's modified average total cost methodology caused variable costs to be counted twice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The atheists objected to the President-elect's inviting ministers to lead prayers at his 2009 inaugural ceremony and his request that the Chief Justice conclude the oath of office with the phrase &quot;So help me God.&quot; The atheists also sought to enjoin inclusion of similar religious elements in future presidential inaugural ceremonies. The district court had denied a preliminary injunction. Two similar suits filed by the lead plaintiff had been dismissed due to his lack of standing. The instant suit was dismissed after the 2009 ceremony was held. On appeal, the court held that inclusion of other plaintiffs in addition to the lead plaintiff sufficed to confer standing. The suit was mooted with regard to the completed 2009 inaugural. Even assuming that the situation was capable of repetition, the atheists were barred from asserting that the issue evaded review because they failed to appeal the denial of their preliminary injunction motion. The atheists lacked standing with regard to future inaugurals because there was no certainty that religious expression would be included in those ceremonies, as the content of inaugurals fell exclusively within the discretion of each President-elect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The California standards applied to transportation refrigeration units (TRUs) powered by diesel engines. Cal.

The association argued that EPA erred in applying &sect; 7543(e)(2)(A)(ii), which required a finding that California needed the rule at issue to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions in California. The court of appeals held that EPA reasonably interpreted the statute and found that California continued to suffer from some of the worst air quality in the nation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convicted on multiple drug, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1962(d), murder, and firearms charges in connection with his drug enterprise in the District of Columbia (D.C.), and sentenced under the Violent Crimes in Aid of Racketeering statute (VICAR), 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1959, to 10 life sentences with two consecutive sentences, defendant appealed from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">VICAR penalties were separate from and in addition to what was authorized by any state or federal law, based upon an additional statutory element -- the underlying violent offense being related to racketeering. VICAR did not authorize cumulative punishments. The D.C. murder conspiracies were charged merely as racketeering acts within the RICO count; there was no multiplicity. The 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 924(c) gun counts were not multiplicitous with D.C. Code &sect; 22-4504(b) gun counts because each required proof of a fact the other did not. The Commerce Clause was irrelevant to applying VICAR in D.C. as U. S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 17, art. IV, &sect; 3, cl. 2, gave Congress plenary authority in D.C. No remand was needed for treating the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual as mandatory because &sect; 1959(a)(1), not the Guidelines, mandated life for the VICAR conviction. Even if there was a merger, the D.C. convictions would merge into the federal counts; the federal mandatory sentences would not change. But, limited resentencing remand was proper because 6 distribution of, or possession with intent to distribute convictions merged into the analogous drug convictions for being near a school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, petitioner cable television companies sought review of a decision by respondent Federal Communications Commission to extend for five years the prohibition under 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 548(c)(2)(D) of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 against exclusive contracts between cable operators and cable affiliated programming networks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 548(c)(2)(D) directed the Commission to promulgate regulations prohibiting exclusive contracts for cable and broadcast programming between a cable operator and a cable programming vendor in which the cable operator had an interest. The exclusivity provision was subject to a sunset provision under &sect; 548(c)(5) under which it would lapse after 10 years unless the Commission found that the prohibition continued to be necessary to preserve and protect competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming. The Commission extended the exclusivity provision in 2002 and again in 2007. The companies challenged the 2007 extension. The court held that &sect; 548(c)(2)(D) had been found facially constitutional under the First Amendment, and the companies failed to raise an as-applied challenge. The Commission reasonably interpreted the meaning of &quot;necessary&quot; under &sect; 548(c)(5) in finding that the prohibition should continue. The Commission found that the ability and incentive for vertically integrated cable operators to withhold programming remained substantial enough to require further extension of the exclusivity prohibition, and that finding was entitled to deference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of narcotics and firearm offenses after the contraband was found in a briefcase in his car during a traffic stop, appealed the United States District Court for the District of Columbia's denial of his motion to suppress. He argued the evidence was discovered during an unconstitutional search of his vehicle and property in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was properly stopped because a police officer's firsthand observations gave him probable cause to believe that defendant had been speeding and driving with windows tinted in excess of the legal limit. Upon approaching defendant's car, the officer saw a knife with a five-and-a-half-inch sheath in plain view on the backseat, easily within reaching-distance of defendant. Although the officer removed the knife and placed it out of arm's reach on the roof of defendant's car, he was justifiably concerned that additional weapons might be hidden elsewhere in the vicinity. While knowledge of a recent double-stabbing homicide in the same neighborhood was not itself sufficient to justify a protective search, it added to the circumstances warranting a search of the car. Finding a second knife concealed under a floor mat provided probable cause for a warrantless arrest of defendant for violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-4504(a). The officer was reasonable in expecting there might be additional weapons in the car, particularly in a locked briefcase found on the backseat. Also, it was reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the locked briefcase.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a 150-month sentence imposed by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia upon entry of his guilty plea to five counts of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2113(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The length of defendant's sentence was based, in part, on the finding that his criminal history under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &sect; 4A1.1 included four Maryland theft convictions. Defendant argued that the certified state court computer records proffered by the Government were insufficient to prove prior convictions by a preponderance of the evidence. The court rejected defendant's contention that the records were unreliable. The records constituted competent evidence under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &sect; 6A1.3, and the mere possibility of error did not warrant the conclusion that the records were inherently unreliable. Further, the fact that the records did not cite the statute under which defendant was convicted did not render them inadequate for the criminal history calculation. Finally, the court rejected defendant's contention that Shepard and Apprendi established a requirement that the Government prove prior convictions only through a conclusive judicial record of conviction. The court joined its sister circuits in concluding that Shepard did not apply when determining whether the Government had satisfied its burden of proof as to the existence of prior convictions.</SPAN></P>
