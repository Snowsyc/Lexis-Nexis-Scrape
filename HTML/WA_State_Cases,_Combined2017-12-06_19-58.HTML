<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Spokane Superior Court (Washington) that convicted him of two counts of first-degree rape and one count of second-degree assault with sexual motivation, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his prior rape conviction and that the assault should have merged into the rape since it was an element of the rape and had no independent purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Approximately 14 months after being released from prison after being convicted of rape, defendant raped two women within days of each other, strangling each one in the commission of the sexual assault. On review, the court held that evidence that defendant previously committed rape was admissible under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.58.090 and Wash. R. Evid. 404(b); the evidence was relevant and appropriate because defendant claimed that his current victims consented to sexual intercourse and because the evidence was relevant to the element of forcible compulsion. However, second-degree assault with sexual motivation under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.36.021(1)(a) and 9.94A.835 should have merged into first-degree rape under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.040(1)(c) because the only assault was the attack and strangulation of one of the victims before and during the act of rape. The assault was used to effectuate the rape and had no purpose or effect independent thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction of second-degree assault was vacated, but his two convictions of first-degree rape were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city approved a temporary use agreement (TUA) that permitted defendant church to use its property to host a homeless encampment. Plaintiff citizens group filed a complaint, challenging the TUA. The group asserted claims alleging due process violations, nuisance, and violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The King County Superior Court, Washington, granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The group appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church was located in a single-family residential zone. The city code did not permit a temporary encampment in a single family residential area. The TUA permitted the homeless encampment to be operated on the church's property for a period of up to 93 days. The court concluded that the city's approval of the TUA was a land use decision within the meaning of the Washington Land Use Petition Act (LUPA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.70, because it was a decision on the church's application for government approval required by law of a property use. As a land use decision under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.020(2)(a), the TUA was subject to LUPA and any challenges to it had to be made within a strict 21-day limitation under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.040(3). The group did not challenge the TUA until July 10, 2008, more than 21 days after the city approved it on June 16, 2008. Therefore, the group's complaint was properly dismissed. The group's failure to challenge the city's decision in a timely LUPA petition barred its due process claims, including its claims for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, because those claims were simply challenges to the approval of the TUA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On remand, the Lewis County Superior Court (Washington) granted the State's request to impanel a jury to consider the exceptional sentencing factor under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(c), rejected defendant's arguments, stayed the sentencing, and certified an order to the court to consider whether the court had jurisdiction to impanel a jury under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.537(2). Defendant sought discretionary review, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it granted the State's motion to impanel a jury. The court agreed that defendant was not entitled to resentencing within the standard range because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(2)(c) authorized the sentencing court to consider the free crimes factor without a jury finding. The court remanded for resentencing with instructions. There was no authority allowing the resentencing court to impanel a jury to consider the free crimes aggravating factor, but Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.537(2) did not prohibit the resentencing court from considering the sole remaining free crimes aggravating factor without a jury. The free crimes factor alleged did not involve any factual finding that a jury had to make. The legislature crafted a procedure for the sentencing court to consider particular enumerated exceptional sentencing factors, including the free crimes factor alleged here, and thus certain case law did not apply. Under case law, pre-trial notice under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.537(1) of the State's intent to seek exceptional consecutive sentences on remand for resentencing was not required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the ruling granting the State's motion to impanel a jury to consider the free crimes exceptional sentencing factor. The court remanded for resentencing at which the trial court could determine this factor and decide whether to impose an exceptional sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Lewis County Superior Court, Washington, convicted defendant of felony harassment, threats to kill and one count of third degree assault. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that a &quot;true threat&quot; was an essential element of the crime of felony harassment and, as such, had to be included in the charging information and defined in the &quot;to convict&quot; instruction. The appellate court found that the definition was sufficient to protect defendant's U.S. Const. amend. I rights. It ensured that the jury would convict defendant only if it deemed his threat toward the victim a &quot;true threat.&quot; The State was required to prove that defendant knew of the officer's status at the time of the assault. The instruction relieved the State of its burden of proving defendant knew the officer's status if the jury found the assault was intentional. The appellate court could infer with confidence that the jury considered all the evidence tending to prove or disprove defendant's knowledge of the officer's status. There was overwhelming evidence by witnesses to the encounter between defendant and the two officers that defendant knew the status of the officer at the time of the assault. The unrebutted evidence showed that defendant knew the person he assaulted was a law enforcement officer. The instructional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction was affirmed; the sentence was reversed and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owner sought review of an order and judgment from the Skagit Superior Court (Washington), which denied his cross motion for summary judgment and dismissed his action under the Land Use Petition Act (LUPA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.70C, challenging respondent county's denial of his rezoning proposal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner sought to rezone property from commercial forest land to low density rural residential land and to amend the comprehensive plan land use map. After an initial review and evaluation, the county declined to place the proposal on its final docket under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70A.130. The owner filed his LUPA petition more than 21 days after the rejection of his proposal and without an administrative appeal. The court held that futility excused the owner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70A.280(1) because the growth management hearings board, erroneously believing that it lacked jurisdiction, had refused to hear appeals in other cases involving rejection of proposals. The lawsuit was properly dismissed under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.040(2), (3) because the owner did not file within the 21-day deadline for land use appeals. Although Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.030(1)(b) made clear that LUPA did not preclude judicial review of a request for writ of mandamus under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.16.170 or prohibition under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.16.300, these remedies and declaratory relief were unavailable because a LUPA appeal was an adequate legal remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment and affirmed the order denying the owner's cross motion for partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.215, arguing that the juvenile court misinterpreted the statute in concluding that he failed to meet the statutory criteria for filing a reinstatement petitioner because he had achieved permanent placement within three years of the termination order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile was born in 1993. In 1998, his mother voluntarily relinquished her parental rights, and the juvenile court ordered a guardianship, placing the juvenile in the care of his grandmother and another relative. The guardianship was in place for 10 years before being terminated upon the request of the guardians. In 2008, the 15-year-old juvenile petitioned for reinstatement of his mother's parental rights pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.215. The juvenile court held that the statute barred the juvenile's petition because he achieved permanency when he was placed in a dependency guardianship within three years of the order terminating parental rights. The juvenile contested that conclusion, arguing that he had not achieved permanency because the guardianship ultimately failed. On review, the court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.215 was unambiguous and did not allow the juvenile to petition for reinstatement of his mother's parental rights. The court rejected the juvenile's contention that &quot;permanent&quot; meant &quot;forever,&quot; and agreed with the State that permanent simply mean &quot;intended to last.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to his demise, the decedent was admitted to the nursing care facility. At the time of his admission, he executed a resident and facility arbitration agreement, which provided that all disputes and claims for damages arising from personal injury or medical care would be resolved through arbitration. After the decedent succumbed, his heirs instituted a wrongful death and survival action. The nursing care facility moved to compel arbitration, relying upon the agreement executed by the decedent, but the trial court denied the motion. On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying the motion because decedent's heirs, as nonsignatories, were not bound by the arbitration agreement signed by the decedent. Further, the decedent's agreement to arbitrate his claims could not restrict his heirs to arbitration of their wrongful death claims because he held no right to those claims. Wrongful death claims were for the benefit of the heirs for the losses suffered by them as a result of the decedent's demise. As such, their claims were distinct from any claims held by the decedent during his lifetime, and his execution of an arbitration did not bind his heirs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Thurston County Superior Court, Washington, which convicted him of first degree robbery as an accomplice, second degree assault, possession of a stolen motor vehicle, and bail jumping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that it was prosecutorial misconduct to offer a witness's plea agreement and to question the witness's about it. According to defendant, the prosecutor used the agreement to impermissibly vouch for the witness's credibility.

The error was harmless, however, as the agreement was not prejudicial and was admissible for rehabilitation. The accomplice liability statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.08.020, was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The trial judge did not err in admitting testimony that defendant supplied marijuana to the witness for resale and drove him to drug sales. The evidence was relevant because it explained why the witness would trust defendant enough to recruit his help with a drug related robbery. The evidence was arguably not more prejudicial than probative. However, the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's bail jumping conviction. Defendant's notice required him to be present on February 4, 2009, at 9:00 a.m. Nothing before the jury established that defendant was absent at the time specified on his notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case was remanded for resentencing. Defendant's bail jumping conviction was reversed for insufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant citizens organization sued respondent county, alleging, among other things, that several provisions in the county's newly adopted shoreline master program (SMP) violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.02.020. Respondent Washington Department of Ecology was allowed to intervene as a defendant. The Skagit County Superior Court, Washington, dismissed the action pursuant to Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(b)(6). The organization appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The organization argued that the county's SMP provisions requiring various buffers from shorelines and restricting the building area of nonconforming lots to no more than 2,500 square feet were indirect taxes, fees, or charges imposed on development by a local government and, as such, were prohibited by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.02.020. The court concluded that the statute's prohibitions did not apply to the county's SMP regulations. The purpose of &sect; 82.02.020 was to prevent local governments from imposing the general societal costs of development on developers. It was not effective against the state. Although the organization argued that 1995 amendments to Washington's Growth Management Act caused SMPs to become subject to &sect; 82.02.020, these amendments did not alter the pervasive level of state control over and involvement in the development of SMPs. Thus, these amendments did not bring SMPs within the ambit of &sect; 82.02.020. The court's holding was driven by the state's pervasive involvement throughout the entire SMP development process. The state's statutorily-required role in oversight and approval of SMPs dictated that &sect; 82.02.020 did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff patient sued defendant dentist, asserting claims for lack of informed consent, breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation, and violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act (CPA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 19.86. The Jefferson County Superior Court, Washington, granted summary judgment in favor of the dentist. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the patient's informed consent claim was time-barred because it was not filed within the three year statute of limitations. The last act occurred by June 1, 2005. The statute of limitations on the patient's informed consent claim expired on June 11, 2008. Because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.70.100(1) required strict compliance with the statute and a 90-day waiting period, when the patient filed her complaint on June 13, 2008, the statute of limitations had expired. Accordingly, summary judgment was properly granted on the informed consent claim. The patient's breach of contract claim was also time-barred. However, regarding the patient's intentional misrepresentation claim, there was a genuine issue of material fact about when the patient discovered or could have discovered the facts constituted the fraud. Thus, it was error to grant summary judgment on the intentional misrepresentation claim. In addition, because there was a question of fact about whether the dentist had an entrepreneurial motive when he withheld information from the patient that nickel would comprise the majority of her crown, summary judgment was improperly granted on the CPA claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order granting summary judgment on the patient's informed consent and breach of contract claims. It reversed the summary judgment on the patient's intentional misrepresentation and CPA violation claims and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a citizen and an individual, sued defendants, a city, a city council, a property owner, and a company, challenging an engineering permit issued to the owner. Under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(b)(6), the Thurston Superior Court (Washington) dismissed the petition under Land Use Petition Act (LUPA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.70C. The citizen appealed. The owner and company sought fees on appeal under Wash. R. App. P. 18.9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen argued that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition. The court affirmed. For purposes of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.060, regardless of whether a petitioner was the owner of the property or an aggrieved person, LUPA required the petitioner to exhaust administrative remedies. Exhausting administrative remedies was always a condition precedent to challenging a land use decision that was subject to review under LUPA. The citizen had actual notice of the city's decision to grant the engineering permit, but the citizen did not file an administrative appeal until more than 14 days later. Thus, for purposes of Olympia, Wash., Municipal Code &sect; 18.75.020, the citizen failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Equitable tolling would not cure the citizen's failure. Like the 21-day statute of limitation under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.040, exhausting administrative remedies was a fundamental tenant under LUPA, and the failure to do either was an absolute bar to bringing a LUPA petition to superior court. For purposes of Wash. R. App. P. 18.9, the citizen's appeal was frivolous and the company and owner were entitled to fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed. The owner and company were entitled to reasonable fees and costs in defending this frivolous lawsuit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State charged defendant, who was a recidivist, with two counts of robbery in the second degree and two counts of robbery in the first degree. Defendant pleaded guilty as charged. The King County Superior Court, Washington, sentenced defendant to life without parole. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his federal constitutional rights were violated when the trial court, and not a jury, found the existence of his prior two strikes for sentencing purposes under the Washington Persistent Offender Accountability Act. The instant court concluded that the State did not have to prove defendant's prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, as would be required if the prior conviction were an element of the crime rather than an aggravating factor in sentencing. There was a rational basis for treating the two categories of recidivists differently. Defendant's argument that the judgment and sentence for his prior robbery conviction was unconstitutional on its face and could not be considered in a sentencing proceeding failed. On its face, the judgment and sentence was consistent with a voluntary plea. The guilty plea statement did not prove defendant was not otherwise informed that an unlawful taking of property was an element of the offense. Because the plea documents did not show the judgment and sentence for defendant's first strike to be facially invalid, the trial court did not err by relying on that conviction to aggravate his sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) of first degree felony murder, first degree burglary, first degree kidnapping, second degree assault, and second degree conspiracy to commit robbery. The jury also found as aggravating factors that the victim was vulnerable and present in the residence during the burglary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised various issues on appeal, but the court affirmed. Although no Washington court explicitly held that the burglary anti-merger statute allowed for separate punishment when burglary was the predicate crime of the felony murder, under case law, the clear legislative intent behind the burglary anti-merger statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.050, compelled such a result, and defendant was unable to show prejudice sufficient to raise a manifest constitutional error. Defendant failed to show that the kidnapping restraint was incidental to the burglary. The 2007 amendments to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.537 changed, rather than clarified, the statute. The amendments affirmatively changed the 2005 statutes so that case law procedural requirements applied to all cases before the court, not just those where the defendant had not pleaded guilty or been tried. Defendant failed to show that applying the 2007 amendments violated the separation of powers doctrine, and the amendments applied. Thus, the trial court had power to convene a jury to hear the State's alleged aggravating factors in defendant's 2006 trial, regardless of whether the court characterized it as a trial or retrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Lewis County Superior Court (Washington) of third degree child rape and the jury found that finding that he abused a position of trust to facilitate the commission of the crime, under Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised many issues on appeal, but the court affirmed. Because aggravating factors were not the same as elements of crime under all circumstances, the court rejected the argument that the addition of the abuse of trust factor under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(3)(n) was a per se substantive change for purposes of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.01.040. Applying Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535 did not alter his penalty, increase the status of his crime, or change the facts the State had to prove to support an aggravating factor. Because the amended statute did not alter the consequences of the crime, defendant was not prejudiced from lack of notice. 2005 amendments were not retrospective and did not disadvantage defendant, who was effectively on notice of the punishment at the time the crime was committed. Defendant had not shown that he faced a presumptively higher sentencing range or was otherwise aggrieved by the trial court's application of the statutory abuse of trust aggravator. The jury had to find the aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt, such that defendant failed to demonstrate an ex post facto violation under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9, 10, Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1998, a jury of the Pierce County Superior Court, Washington, convicted petitioner of two counts of first degree robbery. In 2007, petitioner filed a personal restraint petition, contending that his rights to due process and a fair trial were violated during his trial when he appeared in shackles visible to at least one juror, and that his California assault conviction was not comparable to a Washington strike offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner filed his personal restraint petition almost seven years after his judgment and sentence became final. The court concluded that petitioner did not succeed in showing that a significant change in the law rendered the shackling issue exempt from the one-year bar set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090. However, the court agreed with petitioner that his California assault conviction was not a strike offense. Petitioner's California assault conviction was not legally comparable to second degree assault in Washington because of the different intent elements. In assessing factual comparability, the court observed that petitioner merely conceded that the facts were sufficient to convict him of assault of a peace officer with a firearm in California. The facts were silent as to his state of mind during the shooting, and petitioner had no incentive to introduce any such facts. The facts did not show that petitioner acted with the specific intent to injure a police officer or create an apprehension of injury. Consequently, petitioner's California assault conviction should not have been counted as a strike. Petitioner was actually innocent of being a persistent offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated petitioner's persistent offender sentence and remanded for resentencing, but rejected the shackling challenge as untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Lewis County Superior Court (Washington) that convicted him of failure to register as a sex offender, arguing that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130(7) is unconstitutional as applied because it violates the separation of powers doctrine in delegating authority to county sheriffs to classify the risk level of convicted sex offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130(7) was not unconstitutional as applied and did not violate the separation of powers doctrine for delegating authority to county sheriffs to classify the risk level of convicted sex offenders because the county sheriff adopted the recommendations of state agencies regarding defendant's classification. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.5502  required that the Department of Corrections (DOC) and the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) develop consistent risk level assessment standards, and the legislature intended that the Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration (JRA) consider those same sources of information when making its assessments. Therefore, the legislature provided adequate standards for guiding DSHS and JRA in classifying a sex offender's risk level. Additionally, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13-.40.217(2) required DSHS, when it classified a sex offender as level II or III, to specify the underlying reasons for that classification, and this provided adequate procedural safeguards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order from the King County Superior Court (Washington), which convicted him of possession of methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer stopped defendant for running a red light. The officer arrested him on an outstanding warrant, handcuffed him, and placed him in the back of the patrol car. Another officer searched defendant's car after his arrest and found methamphetamine and glass pipes in the center console of the vehicle. Defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine. On appeal, the court held that defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution were violated when a postarrest search of his car was conducted while he was secure in the back of the patrol car. However, the officer who conducted the search relied on settled case law and had no way of knowing that he was conducting an unconstitutional search. The good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied to permit the jury to consider the evidence obtained during the search. Because suppressing the evidence could not deter police misconduct and would further neither privacy rights nor judicial integrity, it was admissible under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) convicted petitioner of attempted second degree assault under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.021(1)(a), (c) (2003), first degree criminal trespass, and second degree malicious mischief. He petitioned for a new trial or a reference hearing, arguing that his due process rights were violated, his right to a fair trial was called into question, and his counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the evidence supported an inference that petitioner only displayed a sword and that he had no intent to create reasonable fear or apprehension of bodily injury, the evidence could have allowed the jury to find that petitioner was unable to form the intent necessary to commit attempted second degree assault and that he only committed the lesser offense of unlawful display of a weapon under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.270(1). Furthermore, because a conviction of only that lesser crime would have resulted in a sentence of less than a year instead of a life sentence, counsel was ineffective for failing to request an instruction on the lesser included offense of unlawful display of a weapon. Also, based on the conflicting testimony of two doctors, had the trial court instructed the jury on the lesser included offense, there was a reasonable probability that the jury would have convicted petitioner of unlawful display of a weapon instead of attempted second degree assault. Because petitioner was entitled to a lesser included offense instruction and he was able to establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel, he demonstrated prejudice sufficient to grant him relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court granted the petition and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial on the second degree assault charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Pierce County Superior Court, Washington, which convicted him of first degree unlawful possession of a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that absent other grounds to support it, the search of defendant's car exceeded the bounds set by Arizona v. Gant and the evidence obtained in the search had to be suppressed. Defendant was not within reaching distance of the passenger compartment of the car at the time of its search, and there was no reason to believe that the car contained evidence related to the offense for which he was arrested (driving with a suspended license). Therefore, absent other legal support for the search, the search of the car was unlawful. Although the State contended that defendant waived his right to obtain relief under Gant because defendant did not move to suppress before trial, defendant was unaware of the change in the law that would render the search of his car potentially unlawful until well after his conviction. The warrantless search of defendant's car presented an issue of manifest constitutional error prompted by a change in the law, and the court declined to hold that defendant waived the right to challenge that search under Gant by failing to bring a meritless motion to suppress before trial. The court also declined to apply the good-faith exception to the search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for a hearing as to whether grounds other than the arrest supported the search of defendant's car.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Lewis County Superior Court, Washington, convicted defendant of vehicular assault and driving under the influence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court found that the State proved that defendant received notice of his right to independent blood alcohol testing. Defendant did not assert prejudice at trial, nor did he allege prejudice on appeal. A blood alcohol test maintained its probative value despite any variance in administering the special statutory notice. The record contained uncontroverted evidence confirming the reading of the special statutory notice to defendant, including notice of his right to independent testing, at the time of the compulsory blood draw. Any error was harmless as there was sufficient independent evidence that defendant was driving while under the influence of or while affected by alcohol when he ran through the stop sign, crashed into the victim's vehicle, and drove away from the scene. The trial court did not err in admitting the beer cans on the back floorboard of defendant's vehicle following the lawful inventory search. Sufficient evidence supported the verdict that defendant operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and operated his vehicle in a reckless manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sex offender challenged an order of the King County Superior Court (Washington) that denied his motion for summary judgment in a proceeding for his civil commitment as a sexually violent predator, arguing that the State failed to establish as a matter of law that he committed a recent overt act as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.060.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sex offender appealed to authorities to civilly commit him because he felt like reoffending. The State filed a petition under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.060 to civilly commit the sex offender as a sexually violent predator. While the petition was pending, the sex offender moved for summary judgment, contending that the petition should be dismissed because the State failed to establish that he committed a recent overt act and because he had no desire to reoffend but had requested commitment because he needed a place of refuge from harassment by the community. On review, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the sex offender expressed an intent to inflict harm because he described a specific plan to molest minor boys and told authorities that he would carry out his plan if not committed. His expressed intent alone established the threat, regardless of whether he wished to prevent it from being carried out. The trial court properly denied the summary judgment motion and concluded that there was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury on the issue of whether the sex offender had committed a recent overt act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Snohomish Superior Court (Washington) of multiple counts of child molestation in the first degree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that evidence of defendant's prior sex offense was admissible under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.58.090. Defendant was subsequently convicted. On appeal, he challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court affirmed. Section 10.58.090 was permissive, preserving to the court authority to exclude evidence of past sex offenses under Wash. R. Evid. 403. The legislature recognized the court's authority to determine what evidence was to considered by the fact finder. Because the statute permitted, but did not mandate, the admission of evidence of past sex offenses, it did not circumscribe a core function of the courts. The separation of powers doctrine was not violated. The statute did not alter the facts necessary to establish guilt and left unaltered the degree of proof required for a sex offense conviction. The State still had to prove all the elements of the charged crime, in this case, child molestation in the first degree, regardless of whether evidence was admitted under &sect; 10.58.090. The statute did not violate the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws because the statute did not alter the quantum of evidence necessary to convict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant homeowners challenged a decision of the King County Superior Court (Washington), which dismissed their land use petition against respondent city and upheld a preservation board's decision that rejected the homeowners' proposal to develop their home site because it did not preserve protected historic features. The homeowners contended in part that Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code ch. 25.12 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board refused to approve the landowners proposal to develop their property and the trial court ultimately upheld that decision. On appeal, the court affirmed. The ordinance that designated the property as a landmark clearly designated the entire site as a historic landmark, not just the house. The landowners received feedback that any successful proposal would include structures that were smaller than the house and did not visually overpower it. These clarifications removed any ambiguities in the Seattle Landmarks Preservation Ordinance, Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code ch. 25.12, and were sufficient to defeat a vagueness claim. The conclusions of law addressed required considerations under Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code &sect; 25.12.750. Substantial evidence supported the conclusions that the landowners' proposal did not satisfy the Preservation Ordinance. The landowners did not show a total taking destroying a fundamental attribute of property ownership, for taking purposes. The landowners also demonstrated no deprivation of substantive due process. The landmark preservation was a legitimate state interest and the rejection of the proposal was aimed at achieving that purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant professional guardians sought review of an order from the King County Superior Court (Washington), which denied in part their request for extraordinary fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The two wards were profoundly retarded adults living in a residential habilitation center (RHC). In requesting approval of their guardian fees, the guardians sought an allowance of $ 225 per month for guardian fees for routine services and $ 150 per month for &quot;special advocacy fees.&quot; The trial court denied the guardians' request for extraordinary fees in part. On appeal, the court found that the guardians did not show that their advocacy activities directly benefited the wards. While they claimed that the direct benefit derived from the advocacy activities was the prevention of the wards' removal from the RHC, none of the perceived threats to the RHC, as described in the reports, would have necessarily led to its closure and forced the wards to relocate. Nor did they present any expert evidence in support of their opinion that maintaining the wards at the particular RHC would be in their best interests. It was necessary to reverse the trial court's award of a monthly allowance of $ 75 for the guardians' community outreach activities on the same ground. The order did not provide the factual basis for determining the amount of the allowance for community outreach activities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment denying an allowance for the guardians' political and lobbying activities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued in part that the trial court erred in admitting prior sexual offenses under Wash. Rev.

There was no suggestion that evidence admitted pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.58.090 would have been sufficient, alone, to result in a sex offense conviction. The statute did not subvert the presumption of innocence and there was no constitutional violation. Section 10.58.090 showed the legislature's intent that evidence of sexual offenses could be admissible, subject to the modified Wash. R. Evid. 403 balancing test, but the legislation also left the ultimate decision on admissibility to the trial courts. There was no violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.58.090 passed the rational basis test for equal protection purposes and there was no due process violation under U.S. Const. amend. 14 and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants one and two were convicted of second degree felony murder. The court reversed the exceptional sentences and remanded. Because a rational basis existed for the distinctions the legislature made in the felony murder statute, it did not violate equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The felony murder statute was also not ambiguous. Aggravating factors were elements of the crime for purposes of instructing the jury on exceptional sentencing. Where an appellate court had further defined the legal standard of a statutory aggravating factor yet the jury instruction failed to include the legal standard, an error of constitutional magnitude was present. The instructions under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(3)(a), (b) lacked any articulation of the specific elements of each factor, and error was patently obvious on the record. Reversal of the exceptional sentences was required. The trial court comported with &sect; 9.94A.535 through its findings and conclusions regarding the exceptional sentence, but to the extent the trial court went beyond the findings made by the jury, it erred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowner challenged a decision of the Stevens Superior Court (Washington), which ordered an easement as an equitable remedy after finding that respondent landowners encroached on land owned by appellant. Respondents had sued for quiet title and equitable relief or for the establishment of a true boundary, and respondents' bankruptcy court ruled that the case could proceed to judgment. Appellant sought fees and costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue in this case was whether the trial court erred in its equitable remedy by ordering an easement favoring respondents without granting any offsetting relief to appellant. The court held that the trial court erred and vacated the easement and remanded. The unchallenged findings of fact and conclusions of law established that respondents' residence, a pool, and a well were constructed on a parcel acquired by appellant, thereby establishing respondents' encroachment on appellant's property. It appeared that respondents conceded that the easement granted was an inappropriate remedy. The court agreed because respondents' improvements were built entirely on appellant's parcel. The easement awarded in essence rewarded respondents' encroachment without any counter-balancing equitable compensation for appellant. Thus, in equity, the easement did not do substantial justice for appellant. The court vacated the easement and remanded. Certain warranties did not authorize an award of attorney fees on appeal, such that appellant was not entitled to attorney fees and costs on this basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the easement and remanded to the trial court with instructions to decide an equitable remedy. The court denied fees and costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a medical negligence suit against respondent hospital, the hospital moved for summary dismissal of the suit of appellants, the patient and her husband. The Spokane Superior Court (Washington) concluded that the patient and her husband failed to notify the hospital of their intent to sue under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.70.100 and granted the hospital's motion to dismiss. The patient and her husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient was treated at the hospital between October 20, 2003, when she was seen in the emergency room and hospitalized for a stroke, and November 9, 2003, when she was discharged from the hospital. The patient and her husband served on the hospital's registered agent the proposed summons and complaint. They later filed a summons and complaint on October 17, 2007, and properly served an agent of the hospital on November 8, 2007. The patient and her husband argued that their service of the proposed summons and complaint on October 19, 2006, satisfied the notice requirements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.70.100. The appellate court agreed finding that the patient and her husband had satisfied the notice of intent to sue required by the 2006 version of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.70.100 (2006). Further, the service of the proposed summons and complaint was adequate notice that the patient and her husband would sue. Thus, the hospital received a copy of the patient and her husband's proposed summons and complaint along with the offer to mediate. Therefore, their medical negligence claim was improperly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court reversed the summary dismissal of the patient and her husband's suit and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Pierce County Superior Court, Washington, denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence, defendant entered a Newton  plea to six counts of second degree identity theft. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress; the State maintained that defendant's plea was voluntary and thus he waived his right to appeal pretrial motions. The appellate court held that the prosecutor's notation on defendant's statement on plea of guilty waived any objection to defendant's appeal of the Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.6 decision by the State. While defendant did not, and could not, have raised his challenge under Arizona v. Gant, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485 (2009), which was not yet decided, he sufficiently challenged the scope of the search incident to his arrest. However, based on defendant's movements as if he were hiding something under the driver's seat, his odd behavior, the location of the methamphetamine pipe, and the plastic baggie containing the white substance, the officer could have reasonably suspected that defendant had used drug paraphernalia. As proximity of the object to a controlled substance would have helped determine whether the pipe was drug paraphernalia, the officer properly searched the vehicle for drugs, as it was a search related to the crime for which defendant had arrested defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent landowners sought a declaratory judgment ruling that a county assessment within appellant Conservation District was an unconstitutional property tax, which was ultimately dismissed as untimely.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the District contended the trial court erred in rendering a summary judgment in favor of the landowners. The appellate court agreed, finding that the assessment constituted a fee rather than a tax, as the trial court improperly determined. The first Covell factor weighed in favor of treating the assessment as a regulatory fee as the District used the funds to protect water for drinking, recreation, fishing, and commercial activity. The second Covell factor, whether the County allocated the funds for a regulatory purpose, weighed in favor of the District because it segregated the funds the assessment generates into an account used only for water management, storm water maintenance programs, and education. The third Covell factor also weighs in favor of treating the assessment as a regulatory fee because the County used the funds it collected to manage the storm water runoff for the benefit of all county residents. All three Covell factors weighed in favor of a fee  and the trial court therefore erred in finding that the assessment constituted a tax rather than a regulatory fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant nonprofit organization sued respondents, a county, a flood control zone district, and a wrecking yard business, challenging the relocation at public expense of the business from a flood-prone island to a residential neighborhood. The Yakima County Superior Court, Washington, granted respondents' motion for summary judgment. The organization appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The business was located on an island in the Yakima River. Foundations for a bridge were set on the island. The bridge contained an access ramp to the island. The court concluded that the relocation of the business was authorized by the county's interest in limiting further flooding, and, thus, did not constitute a gift of public property or credit in violation Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7. The relocation was for the benefit of the public and came after a lengthy period studying the various means of fighting flood problems. Substantial evidence in the record established that emptying the island and allowing it to return to a natural state (and eventually erode) would safeguard the bridge and ameliorate downstream flood damage. While the business may have benefited from moving to a new facility prepared for it at public expense, that fact alone did not suggest that the purpose of the move was to benefit the business. The evidence clearly and conclusively established that the move was part of regional flood control efforts. The relocation also did not violate the land swap statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.34.330. The statute did not apply because this was not a simple land swap.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, defendant contended the police officer who searched the car in which she was riding violated her right against unreasonable searches and seizures under U.S. Const. amend. IV and violated her right to privacy under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The appellate court agreed, finding that under both Wash. R. App. P. 2.5(a) and controlling precedent, defendant preserved the matter for appeal because a prior supreme court opinion (which applied retroactively to all similarly situated defendants in Washington) held that a search very similar to the one conducted by police in defendant's case violated the Fourth Amendment. Police stopped defendant for a traffic violation and arrested her for driving with a suspended license. Absent proof of a risk to officer safety or destruction of evidence, a search under these circumstances was unconstitutional. The officer testified that he did not search defendant's bag for officer safety reasons, and the State presented no evidence of a destruction risk. Thus, the search violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. And because Washington did not recognize the good faith exception, there was no basis to affirm this unconstitutional search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant dentist sought review of an order from the King County Superior Court (Washington), which upheld an order from respondent, the Washington Dental Quality Assurance Commission (DQAC), revoking his license, prohibiting him from owning a dental practice for seven years, and fining him $ 50,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two former employees filed complaints against the dentist. The complaints alleged that the dentist had engaged in fraudulent billing practices and that he had provided substandard dental care to some of his patients. The Washington Department of Health (DOH) commenced an investigation into the dental practice that included a warrantless inspection of his office, during which an investigator seized various documents and collected other evidence, without any determination from the DQAC as to the complaints' merit. At an adjudicatory hearing, the panel found that the dentist had provided treatment below the standard of care in four cases and that he had committed 11 acts of fraudulent billing. His license was revoked and he was fined. The trial court upheld the decision. On appeal, the court found that the warrantless inspection was invalid under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.130.080(2) because it was commenced before the determination of merit required by the Washington Uniform Disciplinary Act (UDA) was made, indeed before the commission or a panel thereof was even aware of the complaints. The inspection violated the dentist's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the judgment of the DQAC and remanded the case to the DQAC for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered an Alford plea to one count of second-degree rape and one count of third-degree rape. While he was in confinement for his rape convictions, the State petitioned to have him classified as a sexually violent predator (SVP). Before he was released, the State transferred him to the Washington Special Commitment Center (SCC) for involuntary commitment proceedings. While awaiting his SVP commitment, he sought certificates of discharge for his rape convictions. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not entitled to certificates of discharge because he did not complete his community placement term under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.030(7). His community placement term did not commence because he was never in the community under &sect; 9.94A.030(5). Instead of releasing him from confinement at the end of the prison term portion of his rape sentences, the State transferred him to confinement at the SCC. He failed to meet the requirements for issuance of a certificate of discharge because he had not completed the requirements of his sentence, as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.637(1)(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent tenant made a demand for arbitration against appellant, its commercial landlord, pursuant to the parties' lease agreement. An arbitration was held with the arbitrator ruling in the tenant's favor on some of its claims, including an award of attorney fees to the tenant as the prevailing party. The King County Superior Court, Washington, denied the landlord's motion to vacate or modify the arbitration award. The landlord appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied the landlord's motion to vacate or modify the arbitration award because the parties' lease contained a clause in which each party agreed to waive the right to seek judicial review of any such award. On review, the landlord contended the trial court erred in holding the lease's waiver clause was enforceable. The appellate court agreed, finding that Washington's Uniform Arbitration Act,  Wash. Rev. Code ch. 7.04A applied retroactively to all arbitration agreements, prohibiting parties to an arbitration agreement from waiving the right to seek judicial review of an arbitration award. Although the Act was adopted after the formation of the parties' lease, it did not unconstitutionally impair the parties' preexisting contractual obligations to one another because the waiver clause in the lease was invalid even before the passage of the Act. Moreover, even if the nonwaiver provision of the Act did impair the parties' contractual obligations, it was still constitutional, as it was reasonably necessary to accomplish a legitimate public purpose. Thus, the superior court erred by concluding that the lease's waiver clause was enforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer, a retailer, paid state sales tax for purchases made at its Washington stores. The taxpayer sought a refund for the amount of sales tax it paid on defaulted transactions made on its private label credit card. Respondent Department of Revenue (DOR) denied the refund petition. The taxpayer appealed, and the Thurston Superior Court, Washington, granted the DOR's motion for summary judgment. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the taxpayer contended the trial court erred in granting DOR summary judgment, arguing that it was entitled to a refund under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.08.037 (2002). The instant court found that the taxpayer sold all of its interest in its credit card accounts; thus, the taxpayer surrendered both its right to deduct these losses as bad debt and its ability to claim a refund for this defaulted debt. As a result, the taxpayer no longer had the authority to deduct the defaults as bad debt or to seek the sales tax refund. At the time a buyer purchased an item on his or her the taxpayer card, the taxpayer paid the sales tax due to the DOR. This created a statutory &quot;debt&quot; due from the buyer to the seller under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.08.050. As the buyer's statutory debt, as well as the underlying debt for the purchase price, was discharged, the taxpayer no longer held any &quot;debt,&quot; either as defined by state law under &sect; 82.08.050 or by federal law under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 166, directly attributable to its sales tax payment to the DOR.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employee sought review of an order from the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington), which awarded summary judgment to respondents, the Washington Department of Corrections (DOC) and the State of Washington, in an action for negligence under general maritime law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was a DOC employee who worked on McNeil Island. Part of his commute was on a ferry that the DOC operated. One day, he was riding the ferry home after a work shift and was resting his feet on a chair. The ferry captain kicked the chair out from under his feet, causing him to fall and injure himself. The employee received workers' compensation benefits for permanent injuries that allegedly prevented him from working. He then brought an action against the DOC for negligence under general maritime law. The trial court granted the DOC's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that the employee's federal maritime claim against the DOC survived even if he was also covered under the Washington Industrial Insurance Act (IIA). His claim fell within maritime jurisdiction. He was on the ferry for the sole purpose of being transported from work. Further, the State waived its sovereign immunity under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.090. Because a private person or corporation would have been subject to liability under the general maritime law had it operated the ferry and engaged in the same allegedly tortious conduct, the State was subject to such liability as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Washington State Gambling Commission staff denied respondent gaming supply distributorship (supplier) permission to distribute its VIP electronic pull tab machine. An administrative law judge (ALJ) upheld the Commission staff's decision, and the full Commission upheld the ALJ. The supplier sought judicial review, venue was changed, and the Thurston Superior Court, Washington, overruled the Commission's order. The Commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the Commission contended, inter alia, that neither superior court had subject matter jurisdiction over the supplier's petition for judicial review, and that because the supplier's cash cards used in the VIP machine did not meet the definition of a universally accepted currency equivalent. The supplier responded that, as routinely applied by the Commission, the definition of cash equivalents did not include universal acceptance. The appellate court agreed with the supplier, finding that to obtain a &quot;cash card,&quot; the player had to tender U.S. currency or a universally accepted currency equivalent; substantial evidence did not support the Commission's finding that the supplier's cash card did not meet the Commission's own regulatory definition of cash. Further, a constitutional reading of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46.095 showed that the statute was intended to govern venue and that the Washington Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 34.05, governed appeals of agency decisions. Because the APA governed this appeal, Pierce County Superior Court had subject matter jurisdiction over the supplier's appeal and its order changing venue to Thurston County was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission's appeal was denied; the supplier's cross-appeal from the superior court's attorney fee award was granted, in part; and the case was remanded to the superior court for reconsideration of attorney fees and costs and further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent drug task force instituted a civil in rem forfeiture action against the deceased owner's property when a large amount of marijuana was found there; the action was stayed pending the resolution of criminal charges against the owner, to which he eventually pleaded guilty. The Snohomish Superior Court, Washington, rejected the claims of appellants, the estate and its beneficiaries, against the property. The beneficiaries appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the beneficiaries contended they were entitled to assert the &quot;innocent owner defense&quot; to the forfeiture, notwithstanding that the property had been seized prior to the deceased owner's death based on his use of it for commercial marijuana production. The appellate court disagreed, holding that the deceased owner was unable to devise a greater interest in his property than he had, that his interest was subject to the forfeiture proceedings, and the testamentary transfer of the property to the beneficiaries could not prevent its forfeiture. After the property was seized upon probable cause to believe that it was subject to forfeiture, the guilty owner of the property could not defeat its forfeiture by transferring it to someone innocent of drug activity. The beneficiaries were not &quot;innocent owners,&quot; regardless of their involvement in drug activity, as the deceased owner could only transfer his or her interest in the property, which was subject to the outcome of the forfeiture action. The number of marijuana plants found was more than sufficient to indicate that the growing operation on the property was conducted for commercial purposes under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.505.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of four counts of child molestation, misdemeanor indecent exposure, and felony communication with a minor for immoral purposes. The victims were children belonging to his son's girlfriend. On appeal, the court held that evidence that he touched the victims' upper inner thighs while rubbing and moving his hand back and forth and breathing heavily sufficiently established contact with intimate parts for sexual purpose under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.010(2). Further, there was no basis to hold that &sect; 9A.44.010(2) was vague. The statute provided fair notice to any reasonable person of common intelligence that rubbing and touching a child's upper inner thighs, adjacent to her genitals, in a sexual manner was prohibited sexual contact. Finally, counsel was not ineffective for not objecting to the competency of one victim. Because nothing else in the record cast doubt on the victim's competency, reasonable counsel would not have objected to the victim's curious but satisfactory explanation of why telling the truth was better than lying.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the county's assertion that characterizing the utility's generators as personal property required reading the statute out of context. The statute unambiguously provided that the utility's generators were taxed as personal property. Regarding the county's contention that the court's reading of &sect; 84.12.280 contradicted the Washington Constitution, the court concluded that the tax code, as plainly read and properly applied, while in derogation of the common law, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the King County Superior Court, Washington, which convicted him of felony harassment, misdemeanor harassment, and misdemeanor stalking after he threatened the victim on two separate occasions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that insufficient evidence supported his stalking conviction. According to defendant, this was so because the stalking statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.110, required proof of at least six predicate acts of harassment. The court concluded that proof of two incidents of harassment was sufficient to support a conviction for stalking and that the stalking statute was not unconstitutionally vague. In both of the interactions during which defendant directly threatened the victim, defendant engaged in numerous instances of escalating and profane sexual proposals, discriminatory rhetoric, physical intimidation, and, finally, threats to kill. Defendant's contention that this behavior did not constitute a series of acts, and so could not constitute a harassing course of conduct, was without merit. Defendant's contention the stalking statute was unconstitutionally vague appeared to stem either from an incorrect reading of the statute or from foreign case law with flawed reasoning. The double jeopardy clauses of the U.S. and Washington Constitutions were not violated by the fact defendant was sentenced for stalking as well as for harassment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded the review judge's factual findings were supported by substantial evidence, the review judge correctly applied the law, and the factual findings supported the review judge's legal conclusions. The review judge properly applied the preponderance of the evidence standard to the revocation of the licensee's home child care license. The licensee had allowed her son unsupervised access to children in the day care, in violation of a safety plan in which she agreed to never allow her son to have unsupervised access to children. The licensee's agreement to the safety plan showed at least some recognition on her part of the seriousness of her son's problems. Given the evidence of the son's behavioral problems, and particularly the fact that he had been convicted of sexually assaulting a child, the review judge did not err in finding that the licensee's allowing her son access to the children showed a lack of good judgment as to what was in the best interests of the children. This evidence also supported the review judge's determination that the licensee lacked an understanding of how children develop and lacked the characteristics necessary to provide child care.</SPAN></P>

The ALJ found that the building was commercial and subject to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.27.114(1)(b), and determined that the owner was not a contractor and was not excluded from the disclosure requirement under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.27.114(4) (2001). The appellate court ruled that the eight-unit apartment building was a commercial building and that the owner was not a contractor at the time of the roofing contract. The building was not used as the owner's residence, and the owner had always rented out five or more rental units. The roofer violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.27.114(1)(b) by failing to provide the disclosure notice. Also, the contractor to contractor exemption did not apply because the owner, although registered as a contractor in connection with his home inspection business, did not engage in any of the activities set forth in Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Clark Superior Court (Washington), which convicted him for two counts of failure to register as a sex offender under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the State failed to prove that his prior California convictions for lewd acts on a child, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288(a), and for failure to register as a sex offender, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 290(c), were comparable to Washington sex offenses, and thus, the State failed to prove an element of the crime of failure to register as a sex offender in Washington. Upon review, the court determined that although neither Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.010 nor Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288 required the touching of unclothed genitals, Washington, unlike California, required the touching be directed to protecting the parts of the body in close proximity to the primary erogenous areas which a reasonable person could deem private with respect to salacious touching by another. Consequently, the California statute was broader than the Washington statute; the statutes were not legally comparable. In addition, nothing in the record supported a finding of factual comparability. Furthermore, because the California failure to register conviction encompassed underlying acts that were a crime in California but were not necessarily a crime in Washington, such conviction also failed a comparability test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and vacated both convictions and remanded the matter for dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer sued appellee city, seeking a refund of business and occupation (B&amp;O) taxes paid under Seattle, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 5.45.080. The King County Superior Court (Washington) ruled that the city properly calculated the portion of the taxpayer's revenue subject to the B&amp;O taxes by using its payroll costs to estimate the revenue generated by the taxpayer's Seattle employees. The taxpayer appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sole issue was whether the city used an unlawful method to calculate the B&amp;O taxes owed in the audit period. The taxpayer argued that the city was required to use the actual bills that clients paid for work done by its Seattle employees, i.e., the separate accounting method. Neither the city's own tax ordinances nor case law interpreting the United States Constitution required the city to utilize separate accounting methods. However, the specific manner in which the city utilized cost apportionment in this case unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce by improperly attributing revenue to Seattle that should have been attributed elsewhere. Thus, the method failed to meet the Seattle, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 5.45.080(C) requirement that allocations of amounts under the section be made in accordance with and in full compliance with the provisions of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Although the taxpayer had met its burden of showing that the city's tax assessment was incorrect, a remand, rather than an award of summary judgment in the taxpayer's favor, was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

In a personal restraint petition, petitioner argued that police violated his right under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 to be free from intrusion into his private affairs when they viewed the motel registry without a warrant. The Court of Appeals of Washington held that he was not entitled to relief. The Washington Supreme Court had only recently held that a motel registry was a private affair. Trial counsel's failure to file a motion to suppress on this basis was not ineffective assistance of counsel at the time petitioner was convicted. By failing to move to suppress the fruits of the motel registry search, petitioner waived his claim that admission of the evidence was illegal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with robbery and three counts of kidnapping. At trial, the victim identified defendant as the individual who forced his way into her minivan and drove off with her children. After the State presented its case in chief, defendant testified in his defense. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked questions drawing attention to defendant's opportunity to tailor his testimony to the evidence introduced at trial. Defendant contended that the questions constituted prosecutorial misconduct. The Court of Appeals of Washington disagreed. The prosecutor's questions did not infringe upon defendant's rights under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 to be present at trial, to meet witnesses face to face, and to testify in his behalf. Defendant's rights under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 were interpreted no differently than his Sixth Amendment rights. Because the federal constitution permitted the jury to consider a defendant's opportunity to tailor testimony, the questions posed by the prosecutor were allowable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the King County Superior Court, Washington, convicting him of misdemeanor harassment and bail jumping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested and charged with felony harassment after threatening to kill the victim. Released on bail, defendant failed to appear at a hearing on the charge. Defendant was eventually rearrested, tried, and convicted of a lesser-included charge of misdemeanor harassment. Defendant was also charged with and convicted of bail jumping. On appeal, defendant argued that because he was convicted of misdemeanor harassment, his bail jumping conviction should have been sentenced as a misdemeanor. The appellate court disagree. Bail jumping was classified for sentencing purposes according to the nature of the underlying charge at the time defendant jumped bail, not on the basis of the underlying charge's ultimate disposition. Under the plain language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.170, the seriousness of an incident of bail jumping was determined by the status of the underlying offense at the time that the offender jumped bail. The bail jumping penalty classifications were not essential elements of the offense, but rather they defined the seriousness of an incident of bail jumping for purposes of sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Snohomish County Superior Court, Washington, for violating the county noise ordinance after she repeatedly honked her car horn. Defendant appealed. Discretionary review was granted for the limited purpose of determining whether the ordinance under which defendant was prosecuted was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the county noise ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, both facially and as applied, because it criminalized protected speech. The court concluded that the context in which defendant repeatedly honked her horn did not constitute speech as there was no particularized message. Defendant was unhappy with a neighbor for complaining to the neighborhood homeowners association about chickens she was keeping in her backyard. She honked her horn repeatedly at 6:00 a.m. while in front of the neighbor's house to retaliate. After being explicitly warned by a police officer not to do it again, defendant drove down the street and honked her horn three long times when she saw another neighbor involved with the association's decision. Nothing in the record indicated that this conduct was done for any reason other than for purposes of harassment. The ordinance was not void for vagueness. Shortly after the officer's warning not to honk her horn again, defendant drove down the street and for no apparent reason connected to public safety honked her horn several times. Under the particular facts here, there was not an inordinate amount of police discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The King County Superior Court, Washington, convicted defendant of three counts of bank robbery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court improperly limited expert testimony concerning his defenses and improperly instructed the jury about diminished capacity. The appellate court found there was no meaningful difference between the two instructions unless the State was required to prove defendant had a normal capacity to form intent. This was not the law. The State had to prove actual intent. Defendant was entitled to present evidence that he had a mental disorder that interfered with his ability to form intent. The jury was properly instructed that the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did have the intent to steal at the time of the robberies, and that evidence of defendant's mental disorder could be considered. Defendant's expert's testimony presented a significant risk of misleading the jury about the legal standard for insanity and the expert's general testimony would have been duplicative. It was properly excluded. The trial court did not err by counting defendant's prior robbery convictions as strikes as the crimes were comparable to Washington felonies. Defendant's sentence did not constitute cruel punishment, Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code ch. 34.05. The university suspended the professor for two academic quarters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In response to complaints about his verbally abusive behavior, the university brought disciplinary charges against the professor that were adjudicated at an administrative hearing closed to the public and press. The university suspended the professor for two academic quarters without pay and he brought a challenge pursuant to the Act. The superior court denied relief, but the appellate court vacated the university's final order and remanded to the university for a new hearing. The appellate court held that the university did not violate the professor's employment contract, that the Faculty Code of Ethics was not unconstitutionally vague under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and that the university did not violate the professor's free speech rights under U.S. Const. amend. V and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. Verbal abuse and intimidation did not implicate academic freedom. However, the university violated the Act by conducting the professor's disciplinary hearing in secret. The closure of the disciplinary hearing violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.05.449(5) and the faculty handbook did not constitute a provision of law exempting the university from those statutory procedural requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The King County Superior Court, Washington, granted respondent insurer's motion for full satisfaction of judgment after it paid appellant doctor the amount it had calculated as due on the corrected judgment plus post-judgment interest. The doctor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court noted that the parties appeared to agree that only one interest rate under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.56.110 should apply to the corrected judgment. The appellate court found that &quot;Interest on judgments&quot; meant exactly what it said. The interest was applied to judgments, nothing else. Interest was to be applied to the judgment, not the various categories of claims or damages underlying the judgment. Considering the component parts of the judgment, it was clear that it was primarily based on amounts founded or based on the tortious conduct of the insurer. Over $1,000,000 of the total judgment was based on such conduct. Since the legislature chose to impose different interest rates on judgments based on what they were founded on, application of the tortious conduct interest rate to the mixed judgment best effectuated the intent of the legislature. Application of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.56.110(3) to the entire judgment in this case was most persuasive. The doctor was not entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed except for the conditional ruling on application of multiple interest rates, which was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, three erotic dancers, appealed a judgment of the Pierce County Superior Court, Washington, which affirmed a hearing examiner's decision upholding a county auditor's decision to suspend their erotic dancer's licenses for one year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the auditor's representative and the hearing examiner abused their discretion. In determining the length of the suspensions, the auditor's representative erred by using a fixed formula without consideration of appellants' individual circumstances. The auditor's representative considered every violation of the county code provisions regulating erotic dancing to be serious and worthy of the maximum suspension. The auditor's representative failed to exercise the discretion that Pierce County, Wash., Code &sect; 5.14.230(B) provided to her. Because the hearing officer adopted the decision of the auditor's representative without any evidence of consideration regarding the length of the suspensions, his decision was implicated as well. The court rejected appellants' argument that Pierce County, Wash., Code &sect; 5.14.240(C) violated due process because it allowed a hearing examiner to base his or her decision on the preponderance of the evidence standard of review. Appellants did not cite any authority showing that erotic dance licenses are professional licenses. Accordingly, their due process argument failed and the preponderance burden of proof was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for another hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order from the Cowlitz County Superior Court (Washington), which convicted him of telephone harassment, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.61.230.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant called his estranged wife's apartment. The wife's friend answered the telephone. The wife, who was standing very close to the friend, heard defendant threaten to kill her. Both women recognized defendant's voice. Defendant was convicted of telephone harassment. On appeal, defendant claimed that the information was unconstitutionally vague under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. However, defendant did not specify what facts were missing. He also did not allege how the information prejudiced him. The court found that the information contained all of the essential elements under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 2.1(a)(1). Further, a &quot;to convict&quot; instruction did not mislead the jury, did not cause defendant to be wrongly convicted, and, therefore, was not reversible error. It was sufficient that the wife heard defendant's telephoned threat to kill her, regardless of who initially picked up or held the telephone receiver. Even if the &quot;to convict&quot; instruction was erroneous, any such error was harmless. There was no chance that the jury believed that defendant intended or directed his threat to kill anyone other than the wife.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also erred when it held that the spousal incompetency rule, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 5.60.060(1) barred defendant's wife from testifying because the violation of a no-contact order was a crime committed by one spouse against the other, and therefore the exception to the spousal incompetency rule applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court dismissed the underlying action after finding that the taxpayer had failed to pay all taxes, penalties, and interest before instituting legal action to contest all or any part of such taxes, penalties, or instates as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.32.150. On appeal, the court held that where the Department had assessed additional taxes, penalties, or interest against a taxpayer for a given period, &sect; 82.32.150 required the taxpayer to pay the entire sum assessed before seeking a tax refund in a superior court for any partial period within the assessment period. Accordingly, the taxpayer had to pay its entire four-year assessment prior to initiating its action. Furthermore, any inconsistency caused between the application of &sect; 82.32.150 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.32.160 was caused by the taxpayer's simultaneously seeking two different types of review. Although the taxpayer chose to pursue both remedies simultaneously, in pursuing judicial review, it did not comply with &sect; 82.32.150. Finally, the court held that the taxpayer satisfied neither the letter nor the spirit of &sect; 82.32.150.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the superior court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) that denied his motion to dismiss the charge of escape of a sexually violent predator (SVP) under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.115, arguing that the statute violated the double jeopardy and equal protection guarantees under the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant attempted to escape from the facility to which he was committed as an SVP and was charged with attempted SVP escape under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.115 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.28.020. On review of the order denying defendant's motion to dismiss the escape charge, the court held that defendant's prosecution did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, because defendant was not put in jeopardy twice for the same crime. Charging defendant with escape of an SVP prosecuted him for his attempted escape, not for the events that led to his placement in the facility. Further, no equal protection violation occurred because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.115 applied equally to all SVPs and a rational basis existed for distinguishing SVPs from non-SVPs, as SVPs were more dangerous to others than other mentally ill persons who were also committed. Further, a rational basis existed between punishing those who violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.115 and the State's interest in protecting the public from them because such a punishment would likely deter an SVP from escaping and potentially harming members of the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The King County Superior Court, Washington, entered summary judgment in respondent State's favor on appellant poker enthusiast's action seeking a declaratory judgment that the amendments to the state Gambling Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.46, impermissibly interfered with Congress's authority to regulate interstate and international commerce. The enthusiast appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The enthusiast argued that a dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, analysis dictated the outcome of the dispute. The appellate court found that the State identified nothing in the text or legislative history of the statutes it cited that suggested Congress wished to validate state laws that would be unconstitutional without federal approval. The appellate court had to decide whether the burdens imposed by the Gambling Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.46, were clearly excessive in relation to the State's interest in regulating gambling. The regulation was not excessive and the Internet was not entirely off-limits to state regulation. The question was whether the burdens on commerce that the regulation imposed were clearly excessive in relation to the interests that the regulation sought to serve. Given the importance of the State's interests in protecting its citizens from the ills associated with gambling, and the relatively small cost imposed on out-of-state businesses by complying with the Gambling Act, the enthusiast failed to meet his burden of showing that the Gambling Act was clearly excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Washington State University Police Department created a MySpace page using a fictitious name, describing a 13-year-old girl living in Pullman, Washington. Defendant contacted her through the profile and sent instant messages to the account listed on her MySpace page. He was later charged with communication with a minor for immoral purposes. The information alleged that defendant did communicate with a person he believed to be under the age of 18 years through the sending of an electronic communication, for immoral purposes of a sexual nature; contrary to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.090(1). Defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and burdened protected speech. The Court of Appeals of Washington held that the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The requirements under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.090 that the communication be made with the intent that it reach a minor, and done with the immoral or predatory purpose of exposing or involving a minor in sexual misconduct, sufficiently limited the amount of speech or conduct that the statute regulated and ensured that a substantial amount of protected expressive activity was not deterred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner sought relief from personal restraint after he received two 60-month consecutive firearm enhancements on two counts of first-degree robbery and one 36-month firearm enhancement on one count of first-degree possession of stolen property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was convicted of two counts of first-degree robbery, first-degree unlawful possession of a firearm, and first-degree possession of stolen property. The trial court instructed the jury on deadly weapon sentencing enhancements, but it did not instruct the jury on firearm enhancements. The jury returned special verdicts for the sentencing enhancements, finding that petitioner was armed with a deadly weapon when he committed first-degree robbery and first-degree possession of stolen property. Petitioner filed a petition for relief from personal restraint. The court found that the trial court did not enter a finding that the weapon petitioner used was a firearm. Instead, the trial court's notation on the judgment and sentence indicated that it believed the jury had made such a finding. The notation misstated the jury's verdict, in which it found only that petitioner was armed with a deadly weapon. Accordingly, the record did not support the firearm enhancement provisions of the judgment and the sentence enhancement portion of the judgment and sentence was invalid on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the petition. The court vacated petitioner's judgment and sentence and remanded the case to the trial court with directions that it correct the erroneous firearm enhancements. The trial court was to impose the deadly weapon enhancements that the jury's special verdicts authorized and strike the firearm enhancements that the trial court erroneously imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Thurston Superior County Court, Washington, agreed with appellant, school district alliance, that respondent State's 12.7 percent cap on the number of funded students was unconstitutional, but it held that the alliance had improperly excluded the basic education allocation (BEA) in calculating the amount of funding available to school districts for special education. The alliance appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the alliance had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Washington's special education funding process violated Wash. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. The alliance argued that the F-196 reports demonstrated the unfunded difference between the districts' special education costs and all available state and federal special education revenues. Specifically, the alliance contended that, for the 2004-05 school year, the F-196 reports showed statewide underfunded special education costs of $ 147 million. The appellate court found that, to require itemization of each child's BEA was not feasible and there was no constitutional requirement for such an accounting. The Safety Net, 2005 Wash. Laws 518, &sect; 507, did not unconstitutionally limit the districts' access to ample Safety Net funding. The F-196 reports and Worksheet A did not establish underfunding. The alliance could not properly exclude the BEA from its calculations. The special education cost multiplier was an adequate funding calculation to allocate for average special education costs. The Safety Net was constitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the delegated classification system was unconstitutional. Defendant contended that by enacting Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.550(6), the legislature improperly delegated authority to classify sex offenders to the county sheriffs. The appellate court noted that the Thurston County Sheriff's Office became solely responsible for determining defendant's sex offender risk level where none of the other entities listed in &sect; 4.24.550(6) assessed him. The sex offender classification statute did not provide any guidance to a local law enforcement agency. It instructed a local law enforcement agency to consider offender classifications made by other agencies; however, these prior classifications were not binding on the law enforcement agency. By failing to provide criteria or standards, the legislature delegated full responsibility for defining offenders' risk levels, an element of a felony, to local law enforcement agencies. The legislature improperly delegated the task of classifying defendant as a sex offender under &sect; 4.24.550(6) to the Thurston County Sheriff's Office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a bench trial, the Spokane County Superior Court, Washington, convicted defendant of six counts of first degree sexual misconduct, one count of communication with a minor for an immoral purpose, and one count of sexual exploitation of a minor. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions stemmed from his contacts with two teenage girls while he was their youth pastor and teacher. While communicating via the computer, defendant persuaded one of the victims to remove her top and expose her bare chest. Defendant viewed the victim's bare chest through a Webcam. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to support his sexual exploitation conviction because his Webcam viewing of the victim did not constitute a photograph. The instant court, which interpreted the term &quot;photograph&quot; as broadly as possible to encompass any technology containing child pornography, concluded that the sexually explicit acts viewed by defendant over his Webcam involving the minor exposing her bare chest qualified as a &quot;photograph&quot; for purposes of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.040. Therefore, sufficient evidence existed to support defendant's sexual exploitation conviction. The instant court also concluded that defendant could not show prejudice as a result of the trial court's untimely filing of the findings of fact and conclusions of law.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, finding that the Department's proposed guidelines, which were not in effect when the City forwarded its amendment to for review, were not applicable to the City's amendment to its SMP. Also, the City's amendment to its SMP prohibiting private docks in this shoreline of statewide significance was consistent with statutory guidelines because it promoted the public's ability to enjoy the harbor's aesthetic qualities and to navigate its waters. The amendment elevated the public interest over local interest, and preserved the unique character of the harbor. The amendment was consistent with the City's SMP and Comprehensive Plan; and the amendment did not violate the &quot;public trust&quot; doctrine. To the contrary, it protected the public interest in navigation and recreational use of the harbor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The King County Superior Court, Washington, convicted defendant of one count of first degree assault, one count of second degree assault, and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm. Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.533(3), he received a firearm enhancement on the first degree assault conviction and a deadly weapon enhancement on the second degree assault conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the prosecutor was guilty of misconduct in questioning the victim. The appellate court noted that defendant failed to object below to the prosecutor's questions and raised prosecutorial misconduct for the first time on appeal. The issue was waived. Nothing in the witness's answer to the prosecutor connected the word &quot;cuz&quot; with a gang or gang activity. The trial court imposed a firearm enhancement, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.533(3)(a). Defendant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute because he was adversely affected by the statute. Defendant was not similarly situated to persons who committed crimes where possession or use of a firearm was a necessary element. The sentence for first degree assault was the same regardless of whether the defendant used a firearm. Defendant's privileges and immunities claim, Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, failed because the firearm enhancement statute did not impact a right that the privileges and immunities doctrine recognized as fundamental. The appellate court could not adopt a different rational basis standard. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of first degree assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The King County Superior Court, Washington, affirmed respondent's, Washington State Department of Health, Dental Quality Assurance Commission (Commission) order determining that appellant dentist's treatment of a patient constituted unprofessional conduct in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.130.180(4) and (7) and Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 246-817-310. The Commission imposed sanctions. The dentist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dentist argued that the presiding officer improperly failed to disqualify a panel member for bias. The appellate court disagreed. There was nothing to show that the panel member prejudged any issue in the case. The dentist based his assertion of bias on mere speculation, which was unsupported by either the record or logic. The appellate court did not address the dentist's claim of ex parte communication. The dentist failed to object to the panel member's questioning during the hearing and, therefore, did not preserve the issue for review. The dentist's argument that Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 246-817-310 was vague failed. The regulation was construed in relation to the purposes of professional discipline. The dentist failed to include reference to the tests or their results rendered in his file incomplete. The Commission did not arbitrarily enforce the regulation against the dentist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owners sought review of a judgment of the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington), which reversed the decision of a hearing officer from appellee county, granting a reasonable use exception and allowing them to build single family residences on their property. Appellee neighbors objected to the exception.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners argued that they were entitled to a reasonable use exception because the lots at issue were vested by March 1, 2005 under Pierce County, Wash., Code &sect; 18E.20.050(2)(a). The court noted that the owners argument that the neighbors were prohibited from arguing that the lots were not vested and that the owners were responsible for the hardship because although such issues were not the primary issues before the hearing examinerr, they were raised and the owners responded to them. The Pierce County, Wash., Code's plain language demonstrated that vested rights had to be obtained by filing an application, not by the mere existence as lots. The court found that when Pierce County, Wash., Code &sect; 18E.20.050(C)(2)(1) and Pierce County, Wash., Code ch. 18.160 were read together, the hearing examiner could approve a reasonable use exception under that particular set of codes only if the applicants submitted their completed applications by March 1, 2005. Because the owners admittedly did not submit their master application until November 28 and November 29, 2005, they were not eligible for a reasonable use exception because they failed to meet all of the required enumerated criteria.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the superior court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two defendants sought review of the decision of the Clark Superior Court (Washington), which convicted them of possession of a controlled substance (methamphetamine), manufacture of a controlled substance (methamphetamine) with enhancements, and possession of pseudoephedrine with intent to manufacture a controlled substance (methamphetamine) with enhancements, in violation of Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated appeal, defendants challenged their jury trial convictions for possession of a controlled substance (methamphetamine), manufacture of a controlled substance (methamphetamine) with enhancements, and possession of pseudoephedrine with intent to manufacture a controlled substance (methamphetamine) with enhancements. They argued, for the first time on appeal, that the trial court placed them in double jeopardy by refusing to merge their convictions for manufacturing methamphetamine and possession of pseudoephedrine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine. The appellate court affirmed however, stating that under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(1), simply possessing a precursor ingredient with the intent to manufacture could establish the crime of possession with intent to manufacture. Defendants' two methamphetamine offenses did not meet the &quot;same elements&quot; test; they did not merge; and the convictions did not violate the constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy set forth in U.S. Const. amend. V and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The King County Superior Court, Washington, convicted defendant of unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree and unlawful possession of a firearm in the second degree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his prior Oklahoma burglary convictions could not be used as the predicate offenses required to prove that his possession of a firearm was unlawful. The appellate court found that Oklahoma law at the time of defendant's guilty pleas established that those pleas admitted the facts alleged in the informations. The State introduced sufficient evidence to prove factual comparability between defendant's Oklahoma convictions and serious offenses in Washington. The State presented sufficient evidence to support the jury's determination that the pistol with which defendant was arrested was a &quot;firearm.&quot; The missing flint, leather piece, ball, wadding, and powder together performed precisely the same functions that were combined in a single modern ammunition cartridge. The fact that this technology was dated did not render it something other than what it was: ammunition. Any challenge to the trial court's instructions concerning the definition of &quot;firearm&quot; was waived. A gun need not be loaded or even capable of being fired to be a firearm, so long as it was a real gun. Counsel was not ineffective for not objecting to the jury instructions as they were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient alleged that the doctor failed to diagnose an ankle fracture. Suit was filed outside of the three-year limitation period. The patient argued that his lawyer's letters to the doctor were a &quot;request&quot; for mediation and thus the statute of limitations did not run by operation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.70.110. The appellate court found, however, that the correspondence at issue expressed a willingness to consider mediation, but not a request for mediation. Even if a letter to the doctor started the 90-day waiting period under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.70.100(1) (2006), the filing of the patient's complaint was still too late. Former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.70.100(1) extended the time to file. Even if it did not, it created no arbitrary or irrational classification because the time period helped achieve the aim to settle malpractice cases before resorting to court. The requirement was not unconstitutional. The patient's new arguments alleging continuous treatment and concealed negligence were dependent on additional facts and were not mentioned in the trial court's order denying reconsideration. Thus, they were not properly raised. In any event, these challenges had no merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant entered an Alford plea to first degree manslaughter, the Franklin County Superior Court, Washington, imposed an exceptional sentence of 306 months imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State conceded that the sentencing court's imposition of an exceptional sentence based on an aggravating factor not found by the jury could not deemed harmless error in light of the Washington Supreme Court's decision in In re Personal Restraint of Hall. The point of contention in this case concerned the proper remedy for the sentencing court's error. The State proposed two options: either remand for resentencing under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.537(2), which allows a sentencing court in cases where an exceptional sentence was imposed and new sentencing hearing is required, to empanel a jury to find any alleged aggravating factors, or remand for resentencing without determining the applicability of  &sect; 9.94A.537(2). The appellate court remanded for resentencing without determining the applicability of &sect; 9.94A.537(2). Whether the State would seek an exceptional sentence upon remand was speculative - therefore, the applicability of &sect; 9.94A.537(2) was not ripe for the appellate court's review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In granting respondent ex-wife's motion for summary judgment in a paternity action, the Island County Superior Court, Washington, found that appellant ex-husband was the legal father of the ex-wife's child and that Washington's Division of Child Support (DCS) lacked standing to challenge paternity because there was a presumed father. The ex-husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In addition to arguing that the DCS lacked standing to challenge paternity, the ex-wife argued that her ex-husband failed to challenge paternity within two years of the child's birth as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.26.530. The ex-husband argued that his challenge to paternity was timely. The instant court held that the DCS has standing to file a petition challenging paternity whether or not there is a presumed father. The ex-wife and respondent alleged father offered no plausible reason why the legislature would expressly grant standing to the DCS in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.26.505 only to take it away by implication in another section because there was a presumed father. There was no point to such a distinction, especially given the role of DCS in securing child support from the appropriate party. Because the instant court reversed the summary judgment disposition on the ground the trial court erred in concluding that the DCS lacked standing, it did not need to reach the arguments raised by the ex-husband's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the G H County Superior Court (Washington) denying his motion to dismiss the charge of first-degree sexual misconduct with a minor under Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a high school choir teacher, was charged for having sexual intercourse with the victim, an 18-year-old student and member of the choir. Defendant filed a Knapstad motion to dismiss the charge, arguing that he did not commit a crime under &sect; 9A.44.093(1)(b) because it implicitly limited the age of the victims to 16- and 17-year-olds. On appeal, the court agreed, holding that &sect; 9A.44.093(1)(b) was ambiguous but that legislature history indicated that the legislature intended to only criminalize sexual contact between school employees and students aged 16 and 17. The governor's veto statement of the first bill defining student-victims as 16- and 17-year-olds constituted a clear indication of legislative intent and acceptance of the definition. In addition, the final bill report made it clear that lawmakers viewed &sect; 9A.44.093(1)(b) as criminalizing school employees' sexual contact only with a minor who was 16- or 17-years-old.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support defendants' convictions. The State proved that both defendants left a drug house that contained over 68 pounds of marijuana, $ 126,000 in cash, and many other items used in a major marijuana distribution operation, such as scales, cellular phones, packaging materials, and a loaded firearm. Each defendant left the house with one or two black garbage bags that appeared to contain something light. From the pattern of conduct engaged in by others leaving the house that day with similar black garbage bags, including one driver who was found to have three pounds of marijuana in the black garbage bag contained within his vehicle, any rational trier of fact could infer that the black garbage bags defendants were seen carrying contained marijuana. In addition, a detective testified that he smelled fresh marijuana in both defendants' cars. The State also presented sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could infer that defendants intended to deliver the marijuana to others. Likewise, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to convict defendants of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant child's substitute counsel moved to set aside a truancy finding, contending both that the child should have been provided counsel at the preliminary hearing and that the original truancy petition was legally insufficient. A commissioner with the King County Superior Court, Washington, ruled that the child had no right to counsel at the preliminary hearing and denied the child's motion for revision. The child appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that due process required that the child be represented at the initial truancy hearing. Expecting the child to represent herself in the truancy proceeding was to expect her to exercise judgment the law presumed she did not have, in a proceeding that could lead to her incarceration. The truancy proceeding affected the child's rights to liberty, privacy, and education. The initial truancy hearing provided no procedural safeguards to protect the child's rights, and the child could not be expected to protect them herself. Errors in the proceedings were therefore likely, and the risks to the child's liberty interests were great. Although respondent school district argued that there was little risk of error because of safeguards in the prefiling process, these prefiling requirements provided no protection against error after the petition was filed. Representation was required to ensure that the child understood her rights and the consequences of a truancy finding, that the district was held to its statutory duties and standard of proof, and to ensure that the child could explain her circumstances and respond to any suggested changes in her education program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because counsel was not provided to the child in this case, the finding of truancy was vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Snohomish County Superior Court, Washington, which convicted him for felony and misdemeanor telephone harassment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim of defendant's harassing phone calls was a police officer. The instant court concluded that applying the telephone harassment statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.61.230, did not violate defendant's First Amendment right to petition the government to redress grievances. While defendant may have been legally voicing disapproval about the way in which the victim handled an investigation, once defendant used speech to harass, intimidate, torment or embarrass the victim, his conduct became criminal. By threatening to harm and kill the victim, and by using obscene language and vulgar descriptions of sexual acts he threatened to perform on the victim's wife to demean and humiliate the victim, defendant demonstrated a criminal intent to harass, intimidate, torment and embarrass. However, the trial court's order banishing defendant from a city as a condition of sentence did not survive strict scrutiny because less restrictive measures were available to serve the State's interest in protecting the victim's safety and other police officers, the restriction was unrelated to rehabilitation, and the order did not allow defendant to temporarily lift the restriction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, but the banishment order was vacated, and the case was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Thurston Superior Court, Washington, denied appellant Washington Education Association's (WEA) motion for judgment on the pleadings, ruled that the statute of limitations on one of respondent nonmembers' claims was five years, and granted the members' motion to certify a class. WEA appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The nonmembers argued that each employer deducted an agency shop fee from his or her salary and paid it to WEA and that WEA later spent the money in violation of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.760. WEA argued that the trial court erred in denying its Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12 motion for judgment on the pleadings. The appellate court found that, when the 1992 voters enacted Section 16 of Initiative 134, they neither expressly nor impliedly manifested an intent that Section 16 serve as the basis for a new private statutory cause of action. Pursuant to former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.760, the nonmembers did not have the kind of &quot;property interest&quot; that they needed to sue for conversion, and they had not stated a cause of action for that tort. However, they had a common law cause of action for restitution where, assuming the statutory condition later failed, it deprived the initial transfer of its justification and rendered unjust WEA's retention of its benefits. The trial court was directed to modify its class certification as the nonmembers had a cause of action for restitution and unjust enrichment, but not a private statutory action under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 42.17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed and remanded to the trial court to modify its class certification to reflect a three rather than a five-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant alleged illegitimate daughter sought review of a judgment of the King County Superior Court (Washington), which dismissed her petition to recover from respondent personal representative under the decedent's will pursuant to the Trust and Estate Dispute Resolution Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 11.96A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The daughter sought a determination that the decedent's predeceased husband was her father and that, as such, the daughter was entitled to recover as a beneficiary of the decedent's will under the provision that provided for the lawful descendants of the decedent's predeceased husband. The court held that the use of the term lawful descendant in a will manifest the intent on the part of the decedent to limit a class gift to children of married parents. Such did not violate any applicable constitutional provision for probate courts to give effect to such intent. When used in a testamentary instrument to modify words such as children, issue, or descendents, the word lawful had to be read as representing the intent to limit a bequest to children of legally married parents. The decedent's will showed that the decedent intended to exclude from inheriting any children that her predeceased husband might have had with women to whom he was not married. The daughter's claim under the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. amend. XIV was meritless because giving effect to the intent of an individual as manifested in a will did not constitute state action for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A judge found defendant guilty of third degree assault and attempting to elude a police vehicle. The Superior Court Spokane County, Washington, imposed 60 months of confinement and 9 to 18 months of community custody on the third degree assault conviction. It imposed 29 months of confinement on the attempting to elude conviction to run concurrently with the assault sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal of defendant's conviction for third degree assault and attempting to elude a police vehicle, he took issue with the sentencing court's calculation of his offender score for several reasons. He contended that the two 1994 adjudications merged or constituted the same criminal conduct for sentencing purposes. He made the same arguments for the two 1996 convictions. The Court of Appeals of Washington rejected his claims. Defendant's 1994 offenses for attempted robbery and third degree assault did not share the same criminal intent. The informations indicated that defendant attempted to take the victim's coat and negligently caused bodily injury while fleeing. Defendant's 1996 convictions for assault and robbery also did not share the same criminal intent. The purpose of the assault was to attain retribution after the victim disrespected one of defendant's gang members. After defendant fled, a gang member robbed the victim. The Court of Appeals noted that the judgment failed to state that defendant's community custody term would not extend his sentence beyond the statutory maximum of 60 months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction was affirmed. The sentence was remanded to the trial court for clarification that defendant's total confinement and community custody would not exceed 60 months.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tribe owned a casino near to the casino owner's non-tribal casino. The tribe's casino had multiple electronic scratch ticket game terminals. The casino owner maintained that his casino was losing money because he was unable to operate electronic scratch ticket games. At issue was whether the tribe was an indispensable party under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 19. The trial court properly determined that the tribe was a necessary, but absent, party. Because the tribe could not be sued without waiving its sovereign immunity, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider all of the casino owner's claims challenging the validity of the State-Tribe Compact, both directly and indirectly. The appellate court also determined that proposed private electronic scratch ticket game was not equivalent to either the State lottery or the State's previously offered, but now defunct, paper game. Further, the State-Tribe Compact did not violate the casino owner's equal protection, due process, or privileges and immunities rights. Finally, the casino owner failed to establish equitable estoppel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a lessor and a lessee, challenged a decision from the Pend Oreille Superior Court, Washington, which granted civil enforcement of respondent Washington Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) order and injunctive relief in an action under the Washington Forest Protection Act of 1974 (FPA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 76.09.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The DNR issued two stop work orders prohibiting further timber harvesting on two pieces of property. These orders were not appealed, and the DNR later sought enforcement in the superior court. An injunction was granted, and this appeal followed. In partially affirming, the appellate court determined that, due to the failure to appeal, the stop work orders were final orders under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 76.09.080(1). The superior court also had jurisdiction to heard the DNR's enforcement action. Defenses to the civil enforcement action were limited due to the failure to appeal. Arguments that the property did not constitute forest land was rejected. The superior court's order did not violate due process, constitute an unreasonable exercise of police power, or result in unconstitutional takings. A privacy issue was not considered because there was no argument or citation to authority. Finally, expanded costs could not have been awarded under the FPA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's order granting civil enforcement of the orders and the injunctive relief were affirmed. The award of expanded fees was reversed, and the award of fees in the trial court was affirmed. Attorney fees were awarded on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Superior Court No: 06-2-00184-9. Superior Court judgment or order under review. Date filed in Superior Court: November 15, 2007. Superior Court Judge signing: ALLEN C. NIELSON.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mobile home park (the park) filed an action seeking declarative relief invalidating a capital facilities rate (CFR) imposed by respondent county. The Superior Court of Pend Oreille County, Washington, granted summary judgment in favor of the county, concluding that the CFR was not barred by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.67.370 and was a proper regulatory fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The park operated a septic system for the 143 spaces in the park and was not connected to the county's sewage system. In 2006, the county charged the park a CFR fee of $ 253,782 as part of the county's sewer construction program. The county argued that the CFR was not barred by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.67.370 because it was a proper regulatory fee imposed to alleviate the park's burden on an aquifer. The parties disagreed over the meaning and application of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.67.370(2). The appellate court ruled that the plain language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.67.370(2) prohibited charges for available but unused sewer service. The plain language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.67.370(2) prohibited the county from charging the park with the CFR. The county's argument that the CFR was based on the park's impact on the aquifer was unpersuasive. While the ultimate benefit from the CFR may be to abate degradation to the aquifer, nonetheless, the CFR fell within the broad language of the statute prohibiting charges associated with available but unused sewer service.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to the county and its agents. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner's permit to operate a home-based business was revoked upon a finding that he had violated three approval conditions. One violation included the owner's failure to comply with an unlimited and unfettered access condition by being abusive and hostile when county agents came to his property to conduct an inspection. On appeal, the court found that the owner failed to provide a sufficient record to review his claim that the trial court should have granted the owner's motion to continue the summary judgment proceeding so that the owner's recently hired attorney could have prepared for the hearing. In addition, there were no issues of material fact as to whether the county violated the owner's constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and XIV because (1) the owner voluntarily consented to an inspection by county agents during which they learned that the owner was violating his conditional use permit to operate a business out of his home; and (2) the county did not violate the owner's due process rights in the revocation of his conditional use permit. Finally, the owner failed to present sufficient argument for consideration as to his civil conspiracy claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petitioner was prohibited from possessing firearms after, as a juvenile, he pleaded guilty to having repeated forced sexual contact with his two younger sisters. The petitioner argued that because he had fulfilled all the conditions listed in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(4), restoration of the petitioner's firearm rights was mandatory. On appeal, the petitioner contended both that the trial court was required to grant his petition and that, if it was not, the statute mandating this result was unconstitutional. The trial court, however, had no authority to grant the petition because the petitioner was both a class A felon and a sex offender. Nothing in the juvenile court's notification of ineligibility to possess firearms could be read as a guarantee the court would restore the petitioner's rights. Further, the juvenile court's musings as to whether the petitioner's rights could be restored did not constitute rulings. Moreover, the statute imposing the prohibition was constitutional because permanent restrictions on felons' rights to possess firearms constituted acceptable regulation of the right to bear arms under both the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with rape of a child in the second degree. A jury before the Superior Court, Whatcom County, Washington, found defendant guilty on all counts. The jury also found aggravating factors proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecutor filed a pretrial notice alleging three aggravating factors to be submitted to the trier of fact pursuant to Blakely. The trial court found that only one of the factors was a substantial and compelling reason for imposing an exceptional sentence. The appellate court determined that the plain language of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.94A (amended 2007) authorized the trial court to empanel a jury on remand to make the factual findings necessary to support an exceptional sentence. Defendant's argument that the SRA could not be retroactively imposed was rejected because the 2007 amendment was procedural in nature, did not alter the legal consequences of defendant's conduct, and was triggered not by the criminal act but by the sentencing hearing. The Ex Post Facto Clause was also not implicated because, at the time of the offense, the SRA authorized exceptional sentences. Sufficient notice of the possibility of such a sentence was provided. Finally, the fact that the trial court empaneled a jury before rendering sentence was not harmless error because the trial court, at the time, lacked the authority to empanel a jury for such purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction was affirmed. The sentence was vacated, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Pierce County Superior Court, Washington, which convicted him of eight counts of sexual exploitation of a minor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The instant court concluded that the trial court violated defendant's constitutional right to a public trial when it heard defendant's Batson challenge in the jury room. The Batson challenge was an integral part of the jury selection process requiring the trial court to make credibility determinations when evaluating the prosecutor's purported reasons for excluding the only two African-Americans on the panel. Nothing in the record suggested that the trial court recognized, let alone considered, defendant's right to a public trial before removing the hearing to the jury room. Although defendant had not shown prejudice, his right to public trial was structural error that was per se reversible error. The trial court erred when it concluded that a second warrantless entry into defendant's residence by law enforcement for the sole purpose of obtaining information to support a search warrant application was lawful. The trial court properly admitted defendant's statements to law enforcement. Defendant's argument that the statutory defense to the sexual exploitation of a minor charges set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.110(3) was unconstitutionally vague as applied was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions were reversed, and the case was remanded for a hearing on the validity of the search warrant under the independent source doctrine and, if the search warrant was valid and the State elected to retry defendant, for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Clark Superior Court (Washington) convicting him for first degree assault, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.011, and sentencing him to an exceptional sentence of 240 months due to enhancements for using a deadly weapon and for knowingly committing the offense against a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer approached defendant outside of a shopping center because defendant had bizarre behavior. Defendant attempted to run from the scene and, after being restrained, hit the officer with a metal object. Defendant was arrested, taken to the police station, and advised of his Miranda rights. Defendant contended that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to have him evaluated by a psychiatrist in support of his diminished capacity defense and for failing to object to propensity evidence. The court found that the trial strategy decisions were legitimate and did not render his counsel ineffective. Defendant also contended that the exceptional sentence was unlawful and clearly excessive. The jury found that the offense was committed against a law enforcement officer, which was an aggravating factor under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535(3)(v) that justified a departure from the guidelines. The record amply justified a sentence in excess of the standard range. The court also held that the sentence of 240 months was not unconscionable or excessive, given that defendant wielded a deadly weapon and violently assaulted a police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court, King County, Washington, found that petitioner was the de facto parent of a child with whom he had lived since the child was four months old. The court also entered parenting plan decisions. Respondent mother appealed both the de facto parent designation and the final parenting plan granting petitioner primary residential placement of that child and petitioner's biological child, the other child's younger brother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The de facto parent doctrine did not depend upon the availability of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.10.030, the nonparent custody statute. One who met the rigorous test that defined a de facto parent stood in legal parity to an otherwise legal parent, and therefore was vested with the same parental rights and responsibilities, limited only by the best interests of the child. Petitioner met the strict criteria for designation as a de facto parent. The evidence plainly showed that he had developed a bonded, dependent, parent-like relationship with the child, and that he had fully and completely undertaken a permanent, unequivocal, committed, and responsible parental role in the child's life. The superior court did not err in recognizing petitioner as the child's de facto father. Given the evidence of respondent's mental instability and resistance to her diagnosis and treatment, the court reasonably determined that it would be in the younger child's best interests to reside primarily with petitioner. Indeed it was difficult to see how the court could have reached a different conclusion. The superior court did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from her conviction and terms of her sentence to community custody by the Clark Superior Court (Washington) following two jury convictions and sentences for methamphetamine possession. She argued that the trial court erred when it denied her suppression motion, (2) denied her motion to sever the counts, and (3) imposed certain community custody conditions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant was arrested on the first occasion when an individual with an outstanding arrest warrant was spotted in her truck. The officers effected an arrest of the passenger and then demanded to search the truck. When the defendant refused, the officers seized her for obstructing justice and removed her from the truck. The truck's passenger compartment contained a purse containing methamphetamine and syringes. She was arrested a year later with other drug paraphernalia. The court upheld the search and seizure. The officers had authority to search the passenger compartment of the truck incident to the passenger's lawful arrest, and to order the defendant out of the vehicle so they could search it. The search of her purse was directly related to her refusal to get out of the truck and her arrest for obstructing justice. The court also held that both the cellular phone and handheld electronic scheduling and data storage device prohibitions were crime-related prohibitions that were not supported by the record. There was no evidence that she used a cellular phone or data storage device to facilitate her drug possession. Prohibition of drug paraphernalia was upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The condition of community custody prohibiting the defendant's possession of a cellular phone and a handheld electronic scheduling/data storage device. was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on one count of first degree child molestation and three counts of first degree child rape. The state appealed the determination by the Superior Court Spokane County, Washington that it lacked authority to impanel a jury to consider an aggravating factor. Defendant argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.537(2) could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the 2007 legislation only had prospective application because the amendment contradicted the previous interpretation of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.537(2) (2005), the Blakely-fix statute, by the Washington Supreme Court in the Pillatos decision. He maintained that the trial court did not err by determining that a jury should not be impaneled because retrospective application of the 2007 amendment to the facts and circumstances of the case would violate the separation of powers doctrine. The 2007 enactment was intended to amend the Blakely-fix statute, former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.537. Former &sect; 9.94A.537 was clear and unambiguous. The surrounding circumstances in the case supported the presumption that the 2007 legislative enactment was an amendment, rather than a clarification of existing law, and defendant failed to show a separation of powers violation. The Washington legislature clearly intended the 2007 amendment to operate retroactively. Further, the 2007 amendment, by its terms, applied to exceptional sentence cases where resentencing was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the case was remanded for a jury determination of the alleged aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty by a jury in the Pacific County Superior Court (Washington) of second degree assault and attempting to elude a police vehicle. The jury returned a special verdict finding aggravating circumstances under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535 (2005). The trial court sentenced defendant to an exceptional sentence of 100 months on the assault charge and 29 months on the eluding charge. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant led police on a high speed chase in a populated area. During the chase, defendant turned around to avoid a tire spike and drove his vehicle directly toward another law enforcement vehicle that had its lights flashing. To avoid a head-on collision, the officer had to veer off to the side of the road. Defendant later said he was &quot;trying to back the cops off.&quot; Defendant argued that the record did not support the imposition of an exceptional sentence on the assault charge under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535 (2005). The court held that the record supported the jury's special verdict on the aggravating circumstances: that the victim of the assault was a law enforcement officer performing his official duties, and that the victim's status as a law enforcement officer was not an element of the underlying offense. The trial court's findings of fact did not include any additional findings not made by the jury and gave substantial and compelling reasons for imposing the exceptional sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's exceptional sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Cowlitz Superior Court (Washington) conducted a show cause hearing for continued commitment pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090 of petitioner civilly committed individual. The individual appealed a decision denying his request for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether he met the definition of a sexually violent predator. The State cross-appeal a ruling that &sect; 71.09.090, as amended in 2005, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual had been involuntarily civilly committed as a sexually violent predator (SVP). He had remained in custody since 1992, but had refused to participate in treatment. In light of caselaw decided since the individual took his appeal, the court reversed the trial court's ruling that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090 (amended 2005) was unconstitutional. The State had met its statutory burden of presenting prima facie evidence that (1) the individual's condition had not changed sufficiently and he therefore continued to meet the definition of an SVP and (2) any proposed less restrictive alternative (LRA) placement was not in his best interest, and conditions could not be imposed that would have adequately protected the community. The State had met its burden of showing current mental illness and dangerousness. Because the individual failed to demonstrate a change in his mental condition brought about through positive response to continuing participation in treatment, he was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on those issues. A psychiatrist's reports did not provide sufficient evidence that his condition had changed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The denial of an evidentiary hearing was affirmed, but the trial court's ruling that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090 (amended 2005) was unconstitutional was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) that granted the State's motion to vacate his second-degree felony murder conviction and reinstate the original first-degree murder charge 11 years after defendant completed his sentence and was discharged, arguing that reinstatement of the first-degree murder charge placed him in double jeopardy in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with first-degree murder and agreed to plead guilty to second-degree felony murder based on an underlying felony of assault. Defendant received a five-year prison sentence. After defendant served his sentence, he received certification that he had completed all sentencing requirements and obtained an order of discharge. After the Washington Supreme Court, years later, held that second-degree felony murder predicated on assault was a nonexistent crime, the State moved to vacate defendant's conviction and reinstate the first-degree murder charge. On review of the superior court order granting the motion, the court held that convictions for second-degree felony murder predicated on assault were voidable and not automatically void. Thus, double jeopardy barred retrying defendant absent manifest necessity. The State failed to show manifest necessity to recharge defendant. Because defendant served his sentence and because it was the State, and not defendant, that sought to set aside the conviction, double jeopardy barred the recharging and retrying of defendant for the same criminal act for which he had already satisfied his debt to society under the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The superior court order was reversed, and the trial court was ordered to reinstatement defendant's original conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The appellate court found that there was nothing in the record that established that the finding would cause her to lose her teaching certification. She was not working in a position tied to a professional certificate. The proper standard of proof involving abuse of a vulnerable adult was a preponderance of the evidence. The employee failed to cite any authority supporting her claim that Adult Protective Services (APS) had to conduct its investigation in any specific way or indicating how these alleged problems undermined any particular finding of fact. The findings of fact substantially supported DSHS's conclusion that the employee mentally abused a vulnerable adult under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.34.020(2)(c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While committed as a sexually violent predatory (SVP), the sex offender petitioned for conditional release to a less restrictive placement (LRA). On review of the order denying the petition, the court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090 did not violate the sex offender's due process rights. The statute established a procedure by which a sex offender committed as an SVP could be conditionally released to an LRA placement, and the statute thereby created a liberty interest in conditional release that could not be denied absent due process of law. The court held that the best interests standard under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090 was directly related to the offender's dangerousness and mental illness and was narrowly tailored to serve the State's compelling interest in appropriately treating dangerous sex offenders. It also accounted for the inherent dangerousness of sexually violent predators and their unique extended treatment needs by ensuring that the LRA does not remove the incentive for successful treatment participation or distract an offender from fulling engaging in sex offender treatment. As such, the statute did not deprive the sex offender of his due process rights.</SPAN></P>

However, based on the testimony of a mental health professional that defendant repeatedly said he wanted to kill his neighbors and that he had been thinking about it for months, an incident wherein defendant cut down his neighbors trees, the fact that the neighbors had obtained protection orders against defendant, and law enforcement had respondent to a prior harassment complaint regarding defendant, a reasonable person could have seen defendant's statements as a serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm upon or to take the life of another. As such, the failure to instruct the jury on the definition of &quot;true threat,&quot; did not contribute to the ultimate verdict and constituted harmless error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department argued that the statutory reimbursement use of the term recovery included all damages except loss of consortium and that it was entitled to seek reimbursement for the pain and suffering portion of the employee's damages. On appeal, the court held that because the Department did not compensate the employee for his pain and suffering, it could not be reimbursed from that portion of the employee's award. The pain and suffering portion of the employee's third party damages was not a recovery as it was defined under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.24.030(5). The court further noted that the legislative history did not provide evidence that the legislature intended to allow the Department to access the pain and suffering portion of a third party recovery to reimburse it for money it paid to compensate an injured worker's other losses. Finally, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.24.030 did not give the employee adequate notice that third party settlement funds earmarked as compensation for their personal pain and suffering were subject to distribution under Wash.

Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.44.130(11)(a), 26.50.110(1), 10.99.020, and 10.99.050.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A restraining order was entered preventing defendant from knowingly coming within one mile of his niece or her residence. Defendant claimed that the niece's mother informed him that the niece would not be there and told him to pick up some of his belongings. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to find a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.99.050. Because defendant stipulated to the felony sex offense at trial and did not dispute that he was required to register as a sex offender, he provided the trial court with the evidence required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the prior conviction should be included in his offender score. However, the State did not provide independent proof of two prior convictions for sex offender registration statute violations used to calculate defendant's offender score. Finally, although the trial court could impose random polygraph tests, urinalysis, personal breath tests, or blood alcohol content tests as conditions of defendant's community placement sentence, it could not impose a sentence of confinement and community placement that could exceed the statutory maximum allowed under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.20.021(1)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, but remanded for a new sentencing hearing and for clarification of defendant's judgment and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Snohomish County Superior Court, Washington, of two counts of residential burglary and one count of possession of a controlled substance. The trial court ruled that defendant's subsequent convictions in King County, Washington, for second degree trafficking in stolen property and second degree identity theft added back two points to each of his offender scores. Defendant appealed his sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Washington's sentencing statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.589, violated his right to equal protection under the U.S. and Washington Constitutions. The instant court concluded that defendant failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the sentencing statute violated equal protection. The statute was neutral on its face. It treated all those sentenced in a similar fashion by calculating the sentence range for each current offense by using all other current and prior convictions. The statute's sentencing scheme was rationally related to the legislature's stated purposes. It did not offend justice that after an error in calculating defendant's offender score was corrected, the sentencing court calculated defendant's new sentence by taking into account his conduct and then existing convictions. The sentencing scheme did not violate due process. The only reason defendant received the same length sentences at resentencing was because of his continued criminal activity. Moreover, the sentencing court had objective information about defendant's crimes to support the sentence it imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff prison inmate sued defendants, the Washington Department of Corrections (DOC) and several DOC employees, alleging that defendants violated his First Amendment rights and his substantive due process rights, and retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment rights. Pursuant to Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(b)(6), the Clallam County Superior Court, Washington, dismissed the inmate's suit. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The DOC infracted the inmate for referring to a correctional center's superintendent as &quot;anti-male--a lesbian&quot; in a letter to the DOC Secretary. It based the infraction on Washington's criminal libel statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.58.010. The court concluded that Washington's criminal libel statutory scheme, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.58.010 and 9.58.020, was facially unconstitutional for overbreadth and vagueness, and that the DOC based the infraction on an unconstitutional statute. The scheme did not meet constitutional standards under Garrison v. Louisiana because it permitted prosecution of persons for making false statements without actual malice and or making true statements without good motive or intent. Section 9.58.020 was void for vagueness because it included the term &quot;malicious&quot; without reference to &quot;actual malice&quot; as required under New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. The inmate established a cognizable retaliation claim. The inmate alleged that the DOC retaliated against him because it did not issue the infraction until nearly three months after he attempted to send the letter to the DOC Secretary, around the time he was actively pursuing litigation against prison officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of dismissal was reversed, the inmate's infraction was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings at which the inmate would be allowed to raise his claims for damages against the DOC for violating his First Amendment rights, violating substantive due process, and retaliating against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Washington Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) appealed an order of the Spokane County Superior Court, Washington, reversing a board of appeals' decision that had reversed an administrative law judge's ruling that respondent caregiver's actions in restraining a hostile adult resident of an assisted-living facility did not amount to abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The resident suffered from mild retardation, Tourette's syndrome, a bipolar disorder, and was known to become verbally abusive and aggressive. The caregiver was employed part-time by the assisted-living facility, which unlike the caregiver's regular employer, had a &quot;no hands on policy&quot; when dealing with residents. DSHS argued that the trial court should have deferred to its interpretation of abuse, which DSHS contended was supported by substantial evidence. The instant court concluded that the caregiver's actions did not amount to abuse as defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.34.020(2). Substantial evidence showed the caregiver did not willfully injure the resident, nor did she unreasonably confine her. The caregiver properly intervened in the presence of danger to herself, her coworkers, and another vulnerable adult resident. The caregiver's actions were protective, not injurious or ill-intended; thus, they were warranted and not abusive. The trial court properly found that the caregiver did not abuse the resident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent county initiated a lawsuit, and appellant State filed counterclaims, in a contract matter arising out of the treatment of mental health patients. The Thurston Superior Court (Washington) concluded that the State was solely responsible for the care and treatment of long-term public mental health patients under the Involuntary Treatment Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.05. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State contracted with the county for the use of inpatient psychiatric facilities. The issues presented on appeal, among others, were whether the: (1) Department of Social and Health Services was financially responsible for the care of long-term patients; (2)  legislative amendments applied to the grant of injunctive relief; (3) Department could withhold liquidated damages; (4) Department illegally required the county to use Medicaid funds. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.24.300(1)(d)-(f) (former) (2004) did not specify that the county was responsible for the care of long-term patients, and the county was entitled to damages to recoup its losses for the care of these patients. The State's imposition of liquidated damages was an effort to shift responsibility for long-term care, which was inconsistent with the legislative directives. The amendments to Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.05 and 71.24 applied to the county's request for injunctive relief. The contracts did not violate Medicaid policy. Finally, prejudgment interest with respect to the long-term care claim was not available because sovereign immunity was not waived, but prejudgment interest was available on the liquidated damages claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment awarding monetary damages was affirmed. The dismissal of the Medicaid-funding claim and the 85 percent short-term care requirement claim was affirmed. The denial of the motion to vacate the injunction and the denial of prejudgment interest were reversed. The denial of prejudgment interest on the long-term care claim was affirmed. The appellate court granted the State's motion to strike in part and denied sanctions against the county.</SPAN></P>
