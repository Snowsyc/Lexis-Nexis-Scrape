</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The participant received housing-assistance benefits for more than two decades, with one interruption around 1991. In April 2001, the participant pled guilty to misdemeanor fifth-degree assault related to a February 2001 incident for which she served three days in jail. The participant's recertification applications for her housing-assistance benefits included a question as to whether she had participated in a violence related activity, and the participant marked no every time. In 2007, an criminal background check revealed the 2001 conviction, and the county agency decided to terminate the participant's housing-assistance benefits based on the alleged repeated misrepresentations. The court ruled that the participant's fifth-degree assault did not have as one of its elements the infliction of serious bodily injury, and the participant could reasonably conclude that the fifth-degree assault conviction was not within the scope of the recertification applications. Mere bodily harm, as was required for a conviction of fifth-degree assault, was not serious bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of DWI. The district court enhanced the offense from second-degree to first-degree DWI, based on his prior DWI conviction in Alaska in 1999 and the resulting revocation of his Alaska driver's license. Defendant challenged the enhancement of his offense by arguing that his 1999 Alaska plea of nolo contendere was entered in violation of his right to counsel; the district court properly held that defendant validly waived his constitutional right to counsel prior to his plea. The district court properly rejected defendant's challenge to the factual basis of the plea; under Alaska law, it was impermissible for a trial court to inquire into the factual basis of a plea of nolo contendere. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota held that defendant's DWI charge could be enhanced based on a foreign state's revocation of his driver's license, even if he was not given the opportunity to consult with an attorney before he submitted to an alcohol-concentration test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hearing officer concluded that the participant violated her program obligation of cooperating with the CDA due to her failure to attend a required annual recertification appointment, and that her Section 8 participation should be terminated as proposed by the CDA. The participant argued that the CDA misapplied the law to conclude that she did not comply with disclosure obligations, the record did not support the conclusion that she refused or failed to make required disclosures, and the hearing officer's findings were inadequate. The court ruled that the CDA's stated basis for terminating the participant's benefits was legally insufficient, and the evidence did not support a finding that the participant failed to cooperate with the CDA. The CDA's administrative plan did not provide the CDA with authority to terminate benefits for missing an appointment, because the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) declared that the administrative plan bound the CDA, not the participant, and the C.F.R. requirements of the administrative plan did not include provisions for mandatory attendance at annual reexamination appointments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Dakota County District Court (Minnesota), which denied his motion to suppress evidence of drugs found in his car after a traffic stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that police unlawfully expanded the scope of a stop and that the evidence from the stop was inadmissible. On appeal, the court held that defendant's nervousness, the nervousness of his passengers, a report of a suspicious vehicle, dishonesty in answering a simple question, change of an answer, and the out-of-place nature of defendant's car, all logically provoked the police officer's suspicion of illegal activity after stopping defendant's car for failing to signal a lane change. The court held that the officer had reasonable, articulable suspicion, and that the stop's expansion was adequately supported. Each incremental intrusion on defendant's liberty was justified as Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 required. The court found that the officer's efficient, five-minute investigation lacked any constitutional infirmity. Furthermore, the expansion of the substantive scope and duration of the traffic stop was justified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, convicted defendant of fifth-degree possession of cathinone. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.025, subd. 2(1) (2006) was void for vagueness. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the State did not need to prove that the quantity of the cathinone present in the khat had a stimulant effect; khat contained cathinone, which was illegal to possess. The omission of &quot;khat&quot; from the controlled substance law did not preclude a conviction under Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.02, subd. 2(6) (2006), which prohibited possession of cathinone. The district court did not err in determining that the State satisfied the requirement that defendant knowingly possessed a controlled substance. Prior caselaw made it clear that Minnesota law prohibited the possession of khat because it contained cathinone. Therefore, the fair warning requirement was satisfied. Minnesota's scienter requirement overcame any vagueness concern that a person of ordinary intelligence would expose himself to criminal penalties due to the vagueness of the controlled substances schedules with respect to khat. The State presented sufficient evidence to satisfy all three of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the district court erred when it admitted evidence obtained as the result of an unconstitutional stop and search; defendant also argued that the district court failed to make requisite findings of fact pursuant to Minn.

The appellate court disagreed in part, holding first that, based on the totality of the circumstances (the place, time of night, defendant's mannerisms, actions, how he was carrying himself, how he was dressed, and his nervousness), the police sergeant had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to suspect that defendant was involved in a burglary of the closed businesses and, therefore, the investigatory stop was justified. Further, the sergeant had a reasonable basis for the pat-down search based on defendant's furtive movements, avoiding eye contact, refusing to answer, not complying with police requests by continuing to reach his hands into his pockets, and acting nervously. However, the appellate court agreed that the district court erred by failing to make any findings as to each element of the offense, as required by Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.01, subd. 4.</SPAN></P>

The CDA had not produced evidence that the participant's husband was actually living in her rent-assisted unit from July to December 2007. Also, the participant made two attempts to submit what she thought was her tax information, and the record did not show whether she had sufficient income to necessitate filing a tax return in Minnesota. Furthermore, the court found that the CDA decision was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider evidence of the participant's poor English proficiency, and the effect that termination of her rental assistance would have on her five young children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The participant had been involved in the Section 8 rental assistance program through the county agency since 2005. In October 2007, the participant was notified that her participation in the program would be terminated for failing to report employment. The participant requested an informal hearing, and the hearing officer found that the participant's termination was justified because her failure to report three separate places of employment established a pattern of failure to report employment. The court ruled that the participant failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that the hearing officer's decision was unsupported in light of the record considered as a whole. The participant did not contest that she failed to report the income. The record demonstrated that the program required participants to annually recertify. In her July 2007 recertification application the participant listed no current or previous work history. The regulations made no distinction between minor and serious violations. The participant had a responsibility to correctly report household income, and she signed statements affirming that she understood the consequences of failing to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Itasca County District Court (Minnesota) that convicted him of fifth-degree possession of a controlled substance under Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.025, subd. 2(1) (2006), arguing that trial counsel was ineffective and that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he possessed methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a blizzard, a police sergeant saw two vehicles parked in the middle of a road. He approached, thinking that one of the driver's might be having car trouble and need assistance. He noticed three men standing beside a truck exchanging something. Suspecting that they were engaged in a drug transaction, the sergeant began walking quickly toward the vehicles. When the men attempted to get into the truck, the sergeant drew his gun and ordered all of the men to exit the vehicles. When defendant did so, he tossed a baggie away. The baggie was retrieved, and testing revealed that it contained methamphetamine. On review, the court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence showed that he had only momentary control of the drugs and held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction. The statutory language did not require defendant to possess the drugs for any specific period of time, and Minnesota did not recognize a &quot;fleeting possession&quot; exception to the offense of drug possession. Because Minnesota did not recognize the fleeting possession defense, counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a fleeting possession jury instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a divorce action in Washington County District Court (Minnesota), appellant husband filed a motion to vacate an order directing respondent county to withhold income from the husband and pay it to respondent wife. The district court denied the motion to vacate, and the order was affirmed on appeal. Following the issuance of a new income-withholding order, the husband filed another motion to vacate, which was also denied. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the case was on appeal from the original denial of the motion to vacate, the husband's child support obligation ended, leaving only his maintenance obligation. Therefore, the county issued a new income-withholding order and began imposing a $ 15 fee for collecting the income. The husband argued that any standing and authority that county had to withhold income ended when his child-support obligation ended. The court held that the husband's standing claims were barred by the res judicata effect of the prior judgment on appeal because the claims and parties were identical, and the husband had a full opportunity to litigate his claims. The court held that there was no statutory support under Minn. Stat. &sect; 518A.53, subd. 3 (2008), or Minn. Stat. &sect; 518A.50(b) (2008) for the husband's argument that the wife was required to reapply for withholding-only services before the county could impose the service fee. The husband's challenge to the county's status as an intervenor under Minn. R. Civ. P. 24 was also barred by res judicata.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the withholding order to the extent that it did not require the husband to pay the wife's health insurance premiums and remanded the case for issuance of a new order. The court affirmed as to the remaining issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant had received housing assistance since 1997. Beginning in September 2006, the claimant received housing assistance through a voucher program administered by the public housing authority. The public housing authority terminated the claimant's housing assistance effective August 31, 2007, after the claimant allegedly failed to report that another adult was living with her. At that time, the claimant had five children, including one with profound disabilities, and was pregnant with her sixth child. The court ruled that the public housing authority failed to make findings of fact to support its decision to terminate the claimant's public housing benefits, and that the legal basis for termination was unclear. The claimant presented evidence indicating that she had numerous children and that she and her children would be homeless if she lost her housing assistance. The record further indicated that the claimant was pregnant at the time of the hearing, and that one of her children suffered from profound disabilities and could not walk. The hearing officer's decision did not reflect a consideration of these circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants received housing assistance through the Section 8 voucher program, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1437f(o). The claimants were required to submit to annual review of income by the CDA, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1437f(o)(2)(A), because the amount of assistance received was based on family income. The claimants challenged the CDA's calculation of family income, arguing that the CDA should have given them a standard $ 20 exclusion. The court held that exclusions of the first $20 of unearned income did not apply in the Section 8 context. The claimants next contended that the CDA erred in failing to exclude a special dietary allowance from his income. The regulatory definition of medical expenses, under 24 C.F.R. &sect; 5.603(b) (2008), did not exclude medical-diet allowances. The court held that, if the special diet was medically necessary as prescribed by a licensed physician, relators could receive a Minnesota Supplemental Aid medical-diet allowance, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 256D.44, subd. 5(a) (2008).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of first-degree assault, in violation of Minn.

He was sentenced to 68 months for the burglary and 200-months for the assault, which was an upward departure based on a four-week pattern of harassment and stalking of the victim prior to the assault. Following his conviction, petitioner was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. In his fourth postconviction petition, petitioner argued that his sentence should be reduced to the presumptive sentence because of his mental illness and memory loss and because he learned that the stalking charges against him had been dismissed. The court held that petitioner was not entitled to further review of the claims based on his mental illness because they were raised in his earlier petitions. A claim known at the time of a direct appeal and not raised at that time will not be considered in postconviction proceedings. The court also held that the upward departure was not based on a conviction for stalking. The fact that the charges were dismissed did not, by itself, demonstrate that no stalking occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in declining to instruct the jury that intent is an element of the crime of violating an OFP. The instant court concluded that the trial court did not err in declining to instruct the jury on intent. Because defendant had telephone contact with the complainant, knowing of the OFP, the trial court determined that a jury could reasonably conclude that defendant violated the OFP. This was not a situation in which accidental contact was a defense and a jury instruction was necessary to avoid a wrongful conviction. However brief defendant's telephone contact with the complainant was, he engaged in conversation with her, knowing of the OFP, and that prohibited contact resulted in his conviction. The OFP statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague because it defined the violation of an OFP with sufficient definiteness and was properly limited in scope. Defendant was not entitled to a new trial.

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the county, and the landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1976, the landowner purchased the land for the purpose of advertising his museum; the land was then zoned R-2 residential. In 1984, he had the property rezoned to C-3 commercial. In 1988, the county enacted a comprehensive zoning ordinance under which the property was zoned agricultural/natural-resource. The landowner argued that the 1988 ordinance was enacted without the proper procedural, legal, and statutory safeguards and violated his right to due process. The zoning ordinance was signed by the chairman of the county board of commissioners and the county clerk. The county auditor stated that the zoning ordinance had been compiled in the official ordinance books since 1989. The landowner's complaint was not filed until 2007. Therefore, the ordinance was conclusively valid under Minn. Stat. &sect; 599.13 (2006) and not subject to challenge based on alleged notice and publication defects under Minn. Stat. &sect; 462.357, subd. 3 (1988), and Minn. Stat. &sect; 375.51, subd. 3 (1988). The landowner's inverse condemnation claim was barred by the six-year limitations period.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury in the Carlton County District Court (Minnesota) for two counts of failure to register as a predatory offender in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subd. 5 (2006). The district court sentenced appellant to 30 months and 40 months, respectively, to be served concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to convict him because the State failed to prove that his time to register had elapsed and because he was not required to register with his prison case manager. The court held that &sect; 243.166, subd. 3a, concerned offender registration when a person lacked a primary address. For defendant to claim that the incorrect person sought his compliance with the law put form over substance. Defendant was required by law to register as a sex offender, and he did not. Defendant next argued that by filing his 1994 Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) registration form, he was no longer required to comply with the statute (i.e., the time period in which he was required to register ended in 2004). The court held that this 1994 form, filled out by defendant's correction agent, required defendant's signature, among other things, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subd. 4, and defendant did not comply with any of these requirements, including a fingerprint, a photograph, and a consent form. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant. The court also rejected defendant's double jeopardy claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions. However, the court reversed the sentences and remanded for consideration of defendant's correct score under the correct sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed four petitions for postconviction relief, all of which were denied. He filed his fifth petition in 2007.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose out of a nightclub shooting. He was sentenced in 1999 under &sect; 609.11, which provided a mandatory minimum sentence for each conviction of second-degree assault with a deadly weapon. Defendant argued that a jury should have determined the aggravating factors, such as sentencing enhancement and mandatory minimum statutes, beyond a reasonable doubt. Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11 was modified in 2006 to require the finding that a defendant used a dangerous weapon be made by the jury; defendant argued that the amendment should be applied retroactively. However, the court held that defendant not receive an upward departure in his sentence; therefore, the Blakely rule and Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.10 did not apply to defendant's sentences. Moreover, in convicting defendant, the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant assaulted the victims with a dangerous weapon, a firearm. Therefore, the sentence imposed was based on jury findings, not on the judicial finding under &sect; 609.11. The court held that many of defendant's were barred because they could have been brought on direct appeal, because they were brought in a previous petition, or because they were without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's summary denial of defendant's motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the driver contended his right to counsel was violated because what he said to his attorney was not only heard but recorded; he argued that the police officer violated his constitutional rights when he did not turn off the recording device while he was contacting his attorney on the telephone. The appellate court disagreed, holding that the driver was not entitled to a private telephone conversation; thus, his limited right to counsel was fully vindicated notwithstanding the officer's recording of the driver's side of the conversation. Further, the driver did not dispute that he was read the implied-consent advisory and informed of his right to consult with an attorney. The record indicated that he did not ask the officer to stop recording his statements, which would have given the officer an opportunity to address the driver's concerns. Under these circumstances, the appellate court concluded that the drivers right to counsel was vindicated and there was no statutory or constitutional basis for rescinding the license revocation.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals of Minnesota concluded that the facts available to the officers did not afford them reasonable grounds to believe that the woman had common authority over the premises.

He found empty rolling paper containers, plastic baggies and corners of plastic baggies, evidence of drug use, green stems, green leaves, and a substance that later tested positive for THC. Based on this information, the officer obtained a warrant for a no-knock search of defendant's home. The court rejected defendant's argument that the search of his garbage was unconstitutional because the containers sat partially on his driveway. Defendant still had no reasonable expectation of privacy.

The appellate court affirmed however, stating that the district court did not commit clear error in upholding the peremptory strike. Defendant overlooked the fact that the State did not inquire about the circumstances surrounding any of the convictions disclosed by the veniremembers, and the veniremember in question was the only veniremember who had a close family member with multiple criminal convictions. Moreover, the district court found that the venireman might have had &quot;some possible knowledge&quot; of the case after reading a news article.

On appeal, the court held that the trooper's request to search defendant's car was not an unconstitutional expansion of the stop because, even though he may have begun the traffic stop with a hunch insufficient to form a basis for reasonable suspicion that drug use was afoot, he did not ask to expand the search until after making further observations of defendant's behavior and motor skills at close proximity and determining that defendant's behavior and apparent impairment were not the result of being under the influence of alcohol. Defendant had multiple signs of impairment, including weaving and crossing the fog line while driving, slow and deliberate movements, and confusion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint stated that appellant peered into a restroom stall occupied by an officer who observed appellant tap his foot several times and move his foot closer to the stall occupied by the officer. Appellant moved his right foot so that it touched the officer's left foot; appellant was within the stall area of the stall occupied by the officer. Appellant was convicted on a plea of guilty to disorderly conduct. Without a transcript of the plea proceeding, it could not be determined whether the district court erred by denying appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The failure of the complaint to acknowledge entrapment as a defense based on the officer's conduct did not justify withdrawal of the guilty plea. In postconviction proceedings, the Court of Appeals of Minnesota upheld the constitutionality of the disorderly conduct statute against an overbreadth challenge. Appellant's conduct was invasive of the privacy of another and could be prohibited as disorderly conduct under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.72, subd. 1(3). The disorderly conduct statute did not require that anyone other than the officer be disturbed by appellant's conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Mower County District Court, Minnesota, found defendant guilty of second-degree burglary, third-degree burglary, possession of burglary or theft tools, and fleeing a peace officer in a motor vehicle. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the burglary convictions under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.582 (2006). The evidence showed that defendant was the only person near a scrap yard when police arrived soon after someone or something triggered a silent alarm. Someone had cut a gate chain, and police found bolt cutters in defendant's car, which was parked at that same gate. The warehouse door had been opened and a forklift driven from the warehouse out into the scrap yard loaded with a box of copper. Defendant fled the scene. The court also held that none of the acts of prosecutorial misconduct alleged by defendant merited reversal. Counsel was potentially rendered ineffective under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 by conceding guilt on the charge of fleeing a peace officer in both the opening statement and closing argument, but the court could not determine on the appellate record whether defendant consented or acquiesced. Finally, a consecutive sentence for possession of burglary tools was vacated because it arose out of the same behavioral incident as the burglary and thus violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.035, subd. 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed on the issue of consecutive sentences for burglary and possession of burglary tools, vacated the sentence for possession of burglary tools, and remanded for the district court to amend the sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A witness reported to police that pickup truck collided with a street-light pole, left the scene, and drove to a residence. After an investigating officer learned that defendant's brother was listed as the property owner/occupant, he contacted the brother and informed him of the accident. The brother arrived at the home and admitted the officer. The brother went to defendant's bedroom to see if he needed medical attention; the officer followed the brother, observed that defendant was intoxicated, and arrested defendant. On review, the court held that the search was permissible under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, because the brother consented. The brother was listed with the utility company as the owner/occupant of the residence, told the officer that he lived at the residence, voluntarily met the officer at the house, had a key and unlocked the door, and led the officer directly to defendant's bedroom. In light of these facts, it was reasonable for the officer to conclude that the brother had authority to consent to the warrantless entry and search of the residence. Therefore, the brother validly consented to the entry and search of defendant's residence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's daughter continued to live with the family, and her income made the family ineligible for Section 8 assistance. The daughter testified that she moved out of her parents home, but upon learning that her family was excluded from the Section 8 program, she moved back in with her family. The issue was whether the determination by the OCHRA hearing officer that the father's family was not income-eligible for public housing assistance was supported by substantial evidence. The single dispositive question was whether there was substantial evidence for the hearing officer to conclude that the daughter was residing in the father's unit on a certain date. The father and the daughter testified that the daughter had moved out of the home. There was no evidence at the hearing that daughter was actually living in the home on September 1. OCHRA and the hearing officer proceeded on the assumption that, absent the requested documentary evidence of a move, the daughter was still there, and she intended to stay. The hearing officer's decision was unsupported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer arrived at the scene of petitioner's single all-terrain vehicle accident. The officer observed petitioner to be somewhat incoherent. The officer noticed that petitioner had an odor of alcohol emitting from him. While petitioner was in the hospital, the officer, concluding that petitioner was incapable of responding to a request for a blood draw, ordered a blood-alcohol test. Petitioner's driver's license was revoked due to the results of the blood test. On appeal, the court found that the one-vehicle accident, in combination with the indications of intoxication observed by the officer, supported a finding of probable cause to suspect that petitioner was driving while intoxicated. The implied consent statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.51, subd. 1(a) (2006), was constitutional and was constitutionally applied in the case. The trial court's finding that the Commissioner made a prima facie case that the test result was reliable under Minn. Stat. &sect; 634.15, subds. 1(b) and 2 was supported by evidence that a medical technologist administered the blood draw, a Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) kit was used, and the sample was analyzed by the BCA.</SPAN></P>

One of the passengers in defendant's car had an active warrant for her arrest, had escaped from a locked squad car just moments before the pat frisk, and her whereabouts were unknown. The deputies suspected that defendant and others might have aided the prisoner's escape. The deputy reasonably believed that defendant had tried to distract him during the vehicle search by continually interrupting and by failing to follow directions to stand back. The deputy had also discovered an open container of alcohol and a butane torch in defendant's vehicle.

The district court stated why it thought an upward departure was appropriate, and then it adopted the reasons given by the prosecutor. Later, the inmate sought postconviction relief.

Moreover, the plea agreement alone was sufficient to support an upward departure in this case because the Misquadace decision applied only prospectively.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner challenged a summary judgment entered by the Lake of the Woods County District Court, Minnesota, which dismissed his taking and negligent and intentional misrepresentation claims against respondents, a county, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The case centered on the landowner's efforts to develop his property and the regulation of wetlands on the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that summary judgment for the county was appropriate under both a categorical and an ad hoc taking analysis under U.S. Const. amend. V and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 because the landowner failed to raise genuine issues of material fact regarding whether his entire 86-acre parcel was rendered valueless and whether he was deprived of all reasonable use of his parcel. The landowner's misrepresentation claims were barred under the doctrine of res judicata. Even if the claims were not barred, summary judgment was appropriate based on the county's defense of official and vicarious immunity. The trial court did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law for the DNR because the landowner failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the complete diminution in value, or elimination of all reasonable use, of his entire property. Similarly, the landowner's claim that the order for fill removal deprived him of the right to access to his property via a public road was without merit. Because the MPCA's revocation of the certification under 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1341 was an effort to prevent a nuisance and potential harm to human health, no taking occurred as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioner pleaded guilty to third-degree criminal sexual conduct, subsequently failed to appear at the scheduled sentencing hearing, and was later sentenced to the presumptive 33-month term, followed by a five-year conditional-release period. The petitioner sought postconviction relief challenging the imposition of the conditional-release period. The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, denied the petition, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the petitioner contended the district court erred in denying him postconviction relief when the five years of conditional release were not part of his earlier plea agreement, and the imposition of the five-year conditional-release period violated his constitutional rights under Blakely. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that it was undisputed that the petitioner pleaded guilty to third-degree criminal sexual conduct in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.344, subds. 1(b), 2 (2002). Thus, the imposition of the five-year conditional-release period was mandatory. His claim that his plea was not intelligent failed because he was deemed to have been aware of the law since it was enhanced several years before he entered his plea, and he failed to object to the imposition of the conditional-release term at sentencing. Because the petitioner's sentence was final before the ruling in Blakely, and because Blakely did not apply retroactively, the petitioner was not entitled to benefit from the rule in Blakely. Moreover, even if Blakely applied retroactively to the petitioner's sentence, the conditional-release period did not constitute an upward departure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the test-refusal statute, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2 (2006), violated the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. The court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2, did not authorize an unreasonable search and did not condition a privilege on surrendering a constitutional right. Defendant also argued that the test-refusal statute violated his constitutional right to privacy. The test-refusal statute served the State's compelling interest in protecting residents from intoxicated drivers and provided officers with the means to test those that they had probable cause to believe drove while intoxicated. The balancing test favored intrusion by the State on the privacy rights held by defendant. The court also held that the State could use defendant's prior unchallenged license revocations to enhance the current charge without violating his due-process rights. A prior impaired-driving-related loss of license was a qualified prior impaired-driving incident for enhancement purposes, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.03, subd. 22 (2006).</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court disagreed. The legislature could properly define a non-owner driver's failure to provide proof of insurance as a strict liability crime, and it could condition the State's need to prove scienter on a pre-arraignment defense notice of the owner's identity. The court also held that defendant had waived his due process argument by failing to raise it in the trial court but considered the issue in the interests of justice, as permitted by Minn. R. Crim. P. 28.02 subd. 11, because the constitutionality of the provision had not been taken up before, as related to a defendant who was not the owner of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in an attack on the victim. The court affirmed. The trial court acted within its discretion in admitting evidence under Minn. R. Evid. 609(a). Through the admission of a false-imprisonment conviction in conjunction with three crimes of dishonesty, the jury was in a better position to evaluate defendant's credibility as a repeat offender, the false imprisonment conviction was less than 10 years old, and defendant's credibility was an important issue in the case. The prosecutor's statement that it was &quot;every woman's worst nightmare&quot; was improper, but the likelihood of prejudice to defendant was remote because the evidence against defendant was strong and reversal was not required. For purposes of Minn. R. Evid. 404(b), evidence of a prior sexual assault was relevant to the State's case. The similarities between the prior assault and current assault were sufficient to permit admission of the prior assault. Witnesses testified that exhibits fairly and accurately represented the victim's injuries and the floor plan of her apartment, and thus there was proper authentication for purposes of Minn. R. Evid. 901(a), (b)(1).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the tip was not stale, and that the officers had probable cause to believe that defendant's vehicle contained cocaine based on the detailed and credible information the informant provided. The information provided by the informant indicated that there was ongoing criminal activity, selling two kilos of cocaine. A lapse of approximately 24 hours between when two individuals in the vehicle solicited the informant to purchase cocaine and the search of a matching vehicle driven by defendant did not preclude a probable-cause determination. Since the officers had probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained cocaine, the district court properly determined that it was reasonable for the officers to detain defendant while waiting for the drug-sniff dog.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2005, the district court imposed a 48-month prison sentence on defendant after he pled guilty to a charge of driving while impaired, but the district court stayed execution of the sentence and placed defendant on probation. In 2007, the district court revoked the stay and executed the sentence. Defendant appealed, challenging the district court's findings of fact and its ultimate decision to revoke the stay. The appellate court ruled that the district court did not abuse its discretion by revoking defendant's probation and executing his prison sentence. The record reflected that defendant had five prior DWI convictions. The record reflected that defendant had been on probation on at least two prior occasions. Although the district court could have imposed jail time in response to the probation violations, it was not unreasonable to decline to do so in light of defendant's multiple probation violations and his recidivist behavior. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the need for confinement outweighed the policies favoring probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Security guards employed by operators of a music festival saw defendant approach a man they suspected of selling cocaine. Three security guards followed defendant to his tent and eventually requested permission to search the tent. After the search uncovered 90 grams of cocaine, the security guards handed defendant over to the county sheriff's department. On review of defendant's conviction, the court concluded that the district court did not err in denying defendant's suppression motion because the security guards could not be viewed as acting as state agents where there was no showing that the government knew of and acquiesced in the search and where the search was not conducted to assist law enforcement efforts. The evidence established that the county sheriff's department did not know of or acquiesce in the search; the county sheriff's department did not have a role in hiring the security firm, nor did it have control over the security guards. Further, the search was conducted for private purposes; the searches were largely conducted to shield the festival operators from liability, not to assist any local law enforcement agency.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant's requested modification was not an accurate statement of current law in Minnesota. Even if the district court erred in denying defendant's requested instruction, that error was harmless. Defendant was given wide latitude to present his theory of the case, which was that he acted in defense of his brother. But little evidence was presented from which the jury could have concluded that defendant's actions were reasonable for a juvenile but not reasonable for an adult. Defendant did more than just get the victim off the brother: he admitted to police that he hit the victim with a hammer, stabbed him with a barbeque fork, and kicked him. The physical evidence showed that the victim sustained multiple, severe injuries, some of which were consistent with having been beaten with the metal rod on which defendant's bloody fingerprints were found.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, finding that the parties' purchase agreements required the buyer to provide the sellers with a letter from a bona fide mortgage lender indicating that the lender had reviewed the buyer's credit report and that the buyer was preapproved to purchase the properties; but there was no evidence that the buyer met this condition precedent. Further, the financing addendum to each purchase agreement required the buyer to provide the sellers with evidence that she had secured financing by a certain date. Each addendum specified that if the buyer failed to comply with this term, the sellers had the right to terminate the purchase agreement by giving the buyer written notice of their intent to do so. Because the buyer failed to satisfy the condition precedent regarding financing, she was not entitled to any relief.</SPAN></P>

The foster care parents were an uncle and his wife and were the adoptive parents. On appeal, the court held that the district court had to grant a petition for third-party visitation if it found that (1) visitation rights would be in the best interests of the children; (2) the grandparents and the grandchildren had established emotional ties creating a parent and child relationship; and (3) visitation rights would not interfere with the relationship between the adoptive parents and the grandchildren. Minn. Stat. &sect; 257C.08, subd. 4(1)--(3) (2006). Although the documents filed by the grandparents presented a basis for their claims under factor one and factor two, the grandparents did not address factor three. Furthermore, the court did not agree with the grandparents' assertion that on the day set for the hearing the district court was only going to consider the county's motion to dismiss for lack of standing.

Furthermore, the violations were of core conditions of probation such as completion of sexual-offender training and remaining law abiding with no sexual offenses.

In affirming, the appellate court rejected the argument that the MacGyver bombs used in this case were not explosive devices because they did not produce destructive effects. It was not necessary to show that the bombs actually produced the destructive effects; to meet the definition of an explosive device, it was only necessary that the device be capable of doing so. The evidence at trial established that the bombs were capable of producing destructive effects. There was testimony that any MacGyver bomb that exploded was capable of causing destructive effects if it went off near a person or highly flammable material. Moreover, there was other testimony from witnesses about the effect of a bomb actually created by defendant. A vagueness argument was waived because it was presented for the first time on appeal.

The Crow Wing County District Court, Minnesota, found defendant guilty and sentenced him to 30 days in jail, but stayed the sentence for one year on the condition that he remove the dock or confine it to the property's riparian zone. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant raised several issues challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance, arguing that it violated the owner's right to continue a preexisting, nonconforming use, and that the State failed to prove that defendant engaged in any conduct that violated the ordinance. The appellate court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional as it did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, was not unconstitutionally vague, and was not unreasonable. Statutory authorization for regulation of the placement of docks was not defeated by the fact that the ordinance and the enabling state statute used slightly different language. Because the surface water and lakebed were held in trust by the State, the owner did not, by prescription, acquire a property right to the current location of the dock. However, the appellate court agreed that the district court erred by finding defendant guilty as the prosecution infringed on the owner's right to continue a preexisting, lawful, nonconforming use, and the evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant engaged in conduct amounting to a failure to &quot;confine&quot; the dock to his father's (the owner's) riparian zone.</SPAN></P>

Following an appeal and resentencing, petitioner sought postconviction relief. The district court denied petitioner's motion, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner first argued that his mandatory minimum sentence of 144 months' imprisonment was unconstitutional because it constituted an upward departure without a jury determination in violation of Blakely. The court rejected this argument because, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.342, subd. 2(b), the only fact essential to the imposition of a 144-month sentence was conviction of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. When the jury convicted petitioner of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, it also found the relevant facts for sentencing as required by Blakely. Similarly, a five-year conditional-release period of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.109, subd. 7 (2002), was authorized on the basis of the jury verdict and did not require any additional findings of fact to be made by the district court. Because the sentence imposed complied with Blakely decision, petitioner's counsel did not have a legal basis to object to the sentence. Therefore, petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of petitioner's motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

The Fillmore County District Court, Minnesota, denied cross-motions for summary judgment. The township appealed, and the property owners filed a notice of review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners sought a conditional-use permit to create a subdivision. The property owners also sought a zoning variance. The township instituted an interim zoning ordinance, and the property owners later moved to amend their complaint. The district court issued an order that denied the request to add new claims against the township. Three issues were raised: (1) what was the relationship between the township and the county with respect to zoning authority; (2) whether the property owners and the township lacked standing because the township was no longer a party; (3) whether the claims the property owners raised were moot because the interim ordinance was replaced by a final ordinance. The appellate court determined that the two entities had independent zoning authority; therefore, the property owners' argument that the township had no power to act was rejected. As to standing, there was no basis for the determination that the township was dismissed from the suit. Finally, if the district court had a basis for concluding the claims against the interim zoning ordinance were moot, it would have no basis for denying leave to amend the complaint.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, finding that the officer was justified in stopping the driver's vehicle because the license plate was partially obstructed by snow, making it impossible for the officer to read the license plate or see the license tabs from his squad car; this violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.79 (2006) and constituted a reasonable basis for the traffic stop. The driver had an affirmative duty to keep his bumper and license plate free of snow, especially since it had stopped snowing for several hours. Further, the traffic violation justifying the stop was not rectified prior to the officer's making contact with the driver. The driver was not unlawfully detained because he first gave the officer his wife's license, only gave his license after the officer's prompting, smelled of alcohol, and admitted to being at a bar and having several beers before driving.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the patient contended sex-offender treatment would not be provided until he forfeited his U.S. Const. amend. V right against self-incrimination, and there was insufficient evidence that he suffered from a mental disorder. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the patient failed to demonstrate that he necessarily had to incriminate himself to participate in treatment or that he had suffered any consequences related to a failure to self-incriminate. He also did not demonstrate compulsion to trigger a claim of violation of his Fifth Amendment privilege as he did not identify any adverse consequence or disciplinary action imposed by MSOP as a direct result of refusing treatment. Testimony that if the patient did not receive treatment, he would have to be supervised and kept away from the community showed that there was no less-restrictive alternative to MSOP that met his need for treatment and protected public safety. The patient's failure to timely appeal his commitment was a procedural bar to his current argument that the district court clearly erred in finding that, at the time of commitment, he suffered from a mental disorder that supported commitment as a SDP.</SPAN></P>

The admission of the report, however, violated defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer testified that he was stopped on the shoulder of the highway completing paperwork from a previous traffic stop, with his emergency lights activated, when defendant's vehicle passed in the lane closest to him and &quot;rocked&quot; his squad car. The officer testified that the speed limit at that location was 70 miles per hour, and that when he activated his radar just as defendant passed, he obtained readings that indicated defendant was traveling at 69 and 70 miles per hour. The appellate court ruled that as applied to the facts of the case, Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.14, subd. 3(a) (2006) was not vague in any sense useful to defendant. Any person of ordinary intelligence or common sense was at least put on notice that reduced speed would require a driver traveling at or near the maximum speed limit to exercise caution and slow down in the face of such circumstances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Dakota County District Court (Minnesota), which convicted him of two counts of burglary in the first degree in violation of Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for two counts of burglary in the first degree, but the appellate court reversed and remanded for a new trial. At defendant's trial, his cousin testified for the prosecution that defendant was the one who had entered the homes and taken the stolen property. A jury found defendant guilty. However, the appellate court concluded that the evidence of defendant's prior contacts with police and the police surveillance was admitted in error, requiring reversal for a new trial. A lengthy explanation of the evidence leading up to the officers' observations was unnecessary and, because the officers arrested defendant and his cousin in a taxicab while they were in possession of stolen property, it made it unnecessary to present prior police contacts to prove that defendant was one of the two persons who worked in concert on the burglaries. Also, none of the officers was able to identify defendant as the person who actually entered the two victims' homes.

Stat. &sect; 501B.16(23) for an instruction approving its plan to liquidate a repayment fund and to discharge a percentage of its debt to appellant bondholders. The bondholders filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the ground of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and to appoint a receiver. The bondholders appealed the denial of their motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The port authority, to finance development of an area over which it had authority, issued bonds under Basic Resolution 876 (resolution). When economic circumstances made it evident that the fund would be depleted before all of the bondholders would be paid off in full, the port authority petitioned under Minn. Stat. &sect; 501B.16(23) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 501B.25 for instructions on the management and liquidation of the fund. The court held that the district court had authority to issue instructions in response to the port authority's petition. Two earlier orders of the district court, which also approved actions of port authority, were not vacated for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Minn. R. Civ. P. 60.02(d) because the motions to vacate were not made within a reasonable time. The court also found that the denial of the bondholders' motion for the appointment of a receiver, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 576.01, subd. 1 (2006), was also not an abuse of discretion. The resolution did not provide that the bondholders were automatically entitled to the appointment of a receiver upon application, and there was no evidence that the port authority disregarded court orders or committed waste.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Local police received a tip that defendant had used a credit card to access child pornography on the internet. A detective went to defendant's home and met him in the yard, where they talked. The detective testified that defendant admitted having child pornography and consented to a search of his computer. The detective went into the home and removed two hard drives without objection from defendant. Defendant argued that his consent was not voluntary. The court rejected defendant's arguments, accepting the district court's conclusion that consent was not coerced. The detective was dressed in plain clothes and did not touch, handcuff, or threaten defendant, and their conversation was cordial. The court rejected defendant's argument that the district court relied on Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.247, subd. 8 (2004), which was later declared unconstitutional. Because the detective testified that he found 5,894 images depicting sexual acts with children 18 months to 13 years of age and described his training and methodology in determining the children's age range, the district court's rejection of a constitutional challenge to subdivision 8 was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The officer saw a set of footprints in the snow from the pond. The officer noticed that defendant was stumbling and having a hard time walking. The officer testified that he ordered defendant to stop because he was concerned about his medical condition. Defendant argued that the officer's seizure of him was unconstitutional. The commissioner argued, however, that the seizure was justified under the emergency exception to the warrant requirement. The record demonstrated that the officer was motivated by a need to determine whether it was necessary to aid or assist defendant when the officer ordered defendant to stop. Defendant's argument simply raised a credibility issue, and the district court found the officer's testimony to be more credible and reasonable. The appellate court concluded that the emergency exception applied and that the officer's conduct in seizing defendant was reasonable under that exception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate, the claimant and a third individual were running for city council. The candidate distributed anonymous campaign flyers in the newspaper boxes of 90 residents displaying lawn signs in support of the claimant. The OAH found that the campaign flyers threatened voters in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 211B.07 (2006). The candidate denied that he intended to intimidate anyone with the flyer. Rather, the candidate maintained that it was intended to provide individuals who obviously supported the claimant with information about him that might not be generally available to the citizenry at large. The court ruled that at most, the language at issue constituted an ultimatum for the claimant's supporters to take down their signs &quot;or else.&quot; The court was unable to discern what, if anything, the candidate was threatening to do to individuals whose refusal to remove their signs would not go unnoticed in the future. Vaguely ominous-sounding language, without more, did not amount to a violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 211B.07.  While the candidate's actions were far from admirable political-campaign practices, they did not meet the standard for a sanction under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence on his first-degree assault conviction (based on a plea agreement) was reversed and remanded for a Blakely trial. After dismissal of the aggravating factor of &quot;particular cruelty,&quot; no aggravating factor existed to justify a durational departure. The Stevens County District Court, Minnesota, sentenced defendant to 103 months' imprisonment, the high end of the presumptive range, and ordered restitution. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State challenged the sentence imposed by the district court and sought reversal of the district court's order that the aggravating factor of &quot;particular cruelty&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court held that because defendant challenged an aggravating factor not used to impose a death sentence and because no cruel-and-unusual-punishment argument was made, the district court erred by applying a vagueness analysis to the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines. As there was a valid reason to depart that the district court incorrectly ruled was invalid and failed to consider, the appellate court held that a remand for resentencing was warranted. The district court also abused its discretion in its refusal to submit the aggravating factor of &quot;abuse of a position of power&quot; to the jury and in its ruling that aggravating factors not specifically enumerated in the sentencing guidelines could not be used. Although the district court improperly defined the term, because &quot;particular vulnerability&quot; was rejected by the jury, a retrial of this aggravating factor would have violated double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 152.021, subd. 1(1), 2(1), and 152.0261, subd. 1 (2004), and sentenced him to concurrent 98-month (importation) and 122-month (sale) prison sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the use of a Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension lab report at trial violated his confrontation rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. Plain error review under Minn. R. Crim. P. 31.02 applied. The lab report had probative value as to both the nature and the weight of the suspected narcotics--two elements of each of defendant's alleged offenses. Such reports were inadmissible without the testimony of the analyst who prepared them. Thus, defendant established plain error. He also showed a reasonable likelihood that the erroneous admission of the report had a significant effect on the district court's finding of guilt. The lab report was the only evidence on the weight of the seized cocaine apart from its packaging, and the district court expressly and specifically relied on the lab report when finding defendant guilty. The plain error justified reversing the convictions because the lab report was admitted in clear violation of defendant's constitutional rights, and without the lab report, the remaining evidence establishing the weight and nature of the narcotics was either of questionable accuracy or equivocal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed his motion for leave to amend to add additional named defendants. Defendants filed a motion to amend their answer to plead the statute of limitations as a defense. Defendants then filed their motion for summary judgment. The inmate filed an amended complaint, although leave had not been granted, that named the additional defendants and also added a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, a claim that was not addressed in his motion to amend his complaint. The court held that summary judgment for defendants was proper. The two-year statute of limitations, Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.07(1) (2006), ran from the date of the inmate's arrest, not his conviction, and precluded his claims against the original defendants. The same limitations period would have barred the inmate's claims against the defendants he sought to add; therefore, denial of his leave to amend was proper. The district court was not required to consider the inmate's section 1983 claims because they were not properly before the court, having been raised only in the inmate's brief in response to defendants' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged in the Washington County District Court (Minnesota) for fishing with more than two lines in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 97C.315 (2004) and fishing with an extra line in violation of Minn. R. 6266.0500, subpt. 4 (2005). Following denial of their motion to suppress, defendants proceeded to trial on stipulated facts. The district court found defendants guilty of both counts and fined them. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A conservation officer approached defendants' ice-fishing house and saw through a window that someone was fishing inside. He knocked on the door and said, &quot;Game warden, I'm checking licenses.&quot; After a pause, someone said, &quot;Come on in,&quot; and opened the door. The officer entered and observed defendants using eight ice-fishing lines, one more each than allowed. Defendants' motion to suppress this evidence was denied. On appeal, defendants argued that the officer seized them when he knocked on their door and said, &quot;Game warden, I'm checking licenses,&quot; and that this seizure was not supported by reasonable, articulable suspicion. Because defendants did not raise this argument in the district court it was waived on appeal. The court refused to consider it in the interest of justice because it implicated the constitutionality of statutes allowing conservation officers to check licenses and providing penalties for failure to comply. However, because, prior to proceeding to trial on stipulated facts, defendants did not personally waive any of their trial rights as required by Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.01, subd. 3, their convictions were required to be reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendants' convictions and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the results of his breath test. The portion of the implied-consent law that was declared unconstitutional by Fedziuk, tardy judicial review of the administrative action to revoke the license, did not have any effect on the evidence obtained for the related criminal DWI proceeding. Because the unconstitutional provision of the implied-consent statute did not affect the evidence obtained for a related criminal DWI proceeding, the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress the results of his breath test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of a firearm by an ineligible person, and commission of a crime while possessing a bullet-resistant vest. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence of the gun and the bullet-resistant vest, which were obtained during the warrantless search of the vehicle he was driving. The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, denied defendant's motion. Defendant was convicted. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the stop of his vehicle was pretextual and, therefore, unconstitutional. The court found that police officers had probable cause for the stop because of the multiple traffic violations that the officers observed. Thus, the officers' subjective intent was irrelevant to the court's analysis under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Defendant's argument that the stop was pretextual and, therefore, invalid under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 failed. The record as a whole contained ample evidence to establish probable cause for the search of the vehicle because (1) the officers knew that a gas station was a place where multilevel drug dealing was common, (2) the police department received numerous calls for police assistance to the gas station because of criminal activity, (3) the officers saw defendant in the company of a known gang member, (4) a confidential informant's information was sufficiently reliable for inclusion in the totality of the circumstances establishing probable cause; and (5) the officers observed a bullet-resistant vest, a ski mask, gloves, and suspected marijuana in the vehicle. It was not error to deny defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sued respondent township and others, alleging trespass, the unlawful removal of trees, failure to give the required Minn. Stat. &sect; 160.22, subd. 5 (2006) notice of the removal of trees, and a taking. The Todd County District Court (Minnesota) dismissed the taking and trespass claims, but awarded the landowners damages for the failure to give notice as to the tree removal. The landowners and township cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court did not err in concluding that the trespass and taking claims were time-barred under Minn. Stat. &sect; 160.05, subd. 1 (2006), where the finding that there had been public use and maintenance of the drive by a road authority for the required six years was not clearly erroneous. Moreover, the district court's determination of the width of the drive did not exceed the width of actual use. Thus, the drive, including its supporting slopes and structure, was established as a public road, and the landowners were estopped from asserting a taking claim. Since the removal of trees along the drive was limited to the property that was established as a public road under &sect; 160.05, subd. 1, the landowners' trespass-to-land claim was likewise barred. However, the district court erred in concluding that the landowners were entitled to damages for the township's violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 160.22 (2006) because although the landowners benefitted from the statute, there was no implied private right of action under the statute given that Minn. Stat. &sect; 561.04 (2006) expressly provided a private cause of action for the township's failure to provide notice before removing the trees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the award of damages for the township's failure to notify the landowners before it cut down trees, but was otherwise affirmed. The case was remanded for further proceedings to consider the landowners' claim for damages related to the removal of trees under Minn. Stat. &sect; 561.04 (2006).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner brought a claim for unlawful appropriation of personal property against respondent city in conciliation court and was awarded $ 3,375 in damages. The city appealed to the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) and counterclaimed for declaratory relief that the owner did not have the right to maintain a dock on a lake. The district court granted judgment for the city, and the owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's home was separated from the lake by a road and a row of residential properties. The city right of way in the road abutted the shoreline of the lake. The owner had a dock on the lake that had been used by his predecessor since 1931. Despite repeated warnings by the city that the dock was in the city's right of way, the owner failed to remove his dock, boat, boat lift, and other personal property. The city removed it all to an impound facility. The court rejected the owner's argument that the district court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to consider claims regarding ownership of real estate in a case removed from conciliation court, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 491A.01, subd. 4(1) (2006). The city had standing to assert its counterclaim based on its injury-in-fact from the owner's continuing trespass and the expenditure of city funds for the removal and storage of his personal property. The district court did not err in concluding that the owner did not have a legal right to maintain a dock on the lakeshore. Because the owner did not have a property right in the dock, his constitutional claims stemming from that claimed right were properly rejected.</SPAN></P>

The petitioner alleged a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. The petitioner also argued that the conditional-release was an upward departure of his sentence. By its plain language, Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.276 required a district court to impose a five-year conditional-release term when there was a commitment to the Commissioner of Corrections. The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the conditional release term because the executed sentence and conditional-release period constituted one punishment for the same offense, so there was no violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Further, there was no abuse of discretion because the trial court was allowed to make an individual determination and order an appropriate sentence. Finally, no aggravating factors needed to be proved to apply the conditional-release term.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a bench trial, the Chisago County District Court, Minnesota, found defendant guilty of failing to register as a sex offender because he did not notify law enforcement authorities at least five days before moving from his primary address, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subd. 3(b) (2000), and of failing to return the annual address-verification forms sent to him, in violation of &sect; 243.166, subd. 4(e)(2). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to the charge of failing to register, the court held that the State's exercise of jurisdiction was not unconstitutional because an element of the crime occurred in Minnesota. The case met the constitutionally allowable jurisdictional reach of the first paragraph of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.025 (2000), which required that part of the offense occur within the state, because an essential element of failing to register was that defendant was a predatory offender, based on criminal conduct that occurred in Minnesota. Alternatively, it met the jurisdictional condition of the third paragraph of &sect; 609.025, which required that the offense caused a criminal result within the state, because a predator's willful failure to register his whereabouts had the same detrimental impact within the state regardless of where the predator resided at the time of the failure. However, the evidence was not sufficient to support defendant's conviction for failing to return annual address-verification forms because the State did not present evidence that he ever received any of the forms. It would have been speculative to infer that he continued to live at the address to which the verification forms were sent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction for failing to return the annual address-verification forms sent to his address, otherwise affirmed the judgment, and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police dispatch advised an officer of a report of a suspicious vehicle with three occupants. A woman informed dispatch that a black male approached her residence looking for someone who did not live there. The officer approached a vehicle and the officer stated that the occupants made furtive movements. Another officer arrived, and a passenger identified himself. The officer ran a warrant check on defendant. An officer found methamphetamine in his search of defendant. At issue was whether defendant was properly seized. The appellate court concluded that merely questioning defendant about their reasons for being in the area was not a seizure. Nevertheless, when the officer took defendant's license to run a warrant check, without a reasonable basis for doing so, the seizure was improper. The officers had no sequence of events that would give rise to probable cause for arrest and search until long after the suspicion of criminal activity should have been dispelled. The district court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress the methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner father filed a motion to modify child custody, which had been granted to respondent mother. The Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) concluded that the child was not endangered and denied the father's motion. The district court continued a protective order but expanded it, forbidding the parties to make certain statements. The district court awarded the mother need-based attorney fees. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married less than a year when their son was born and separated soon after. The mother had a son from a prior marriage who was 8 years older than their child. During the divorce proceedings, the district court ordered that neither party could use information obtained through the discovery process outside of the legal proceeding. The court held that the record supported the district court's finding of no endangerment and its denial of modification of custody. Despite claims of physical violence and inappropriate behavior between the parties' child and his older half brother, professionals testified that the parties' child showed no signs of physical or sexual abuse and that the half-brother did not pose a threat. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to discontinue the $ 250,000 life insurance obligation, although the remaining maximum child-support obligation was approximately $ 183,468. The new, expanded protective order prohibiting publishing &quot;anything&quot; about the mother or her family went beyond protecting the child's interests. It was an unconstitutional, overly broad, content-based restriction of the father's right to free speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's denial of the father's motion to modify custody, the award of attorney fees, and the ordered continuation of the $ 250,000 life insurance obligation. The protective order prohibiting the father from publishing anything about the mother was overbroad and was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Regarding defendant's argument that the officers arrested him without probable cause based on the officers' approach with guns drawn, the fact that the officers lacked probable cause at the time of the stop to arrest defendant did not provide a basis for suppressing the evidence of the gun, because the officers were not required to risk their lives by approaching, without their guns drawn, four men at a location where shots had been fired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Minnesota Constitution, a person was seized if in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that the person was neither free to disregard the police questions nor free to terminate the encounter. The appellate court concluded that the district court properly determined that a seizure occurred only when a police officer ordered defendant to stop, while running after him. Before that time, the officer had made no show of authority that would cause a reasonable person to believe that he was not free to disregard the officer or to terminate the encounter. There was reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to support that seizure because defendant exhibited evasive conduct and he was in an area late at night that had a history of criminal activity. Because the officer ordered defendant several times to stop but he did not comply and the officer had to physically force defendant to the ground and pin his arms behind his back, a custodial arrest of defendant for a misdemeanor was authorized under Minn. R. Crim. P. 6.01, and the subsequent search incident to that arrest was proper.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 609.378, subd. 1(b)(1) (2004). The Scott County District Court (Minnesota) imposed sex-offender-based sentencing provisions that required him to register as a predatory sex offender and undergo a psychosexual evaluation. Defendant challenged the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's argument that his child endangerment conviction did not require him to register as a predatory offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subd. 1b (Supp. 2005), was rejected where the complaint detailed the facts of defendant's ongoing, interconnected pattern of conduct having sexual overtones that involved the child victim and the same time period. Defendant's acquittal of the criminal sexual conduct charges did not extinguish the connection between the alleged conduct and the conduct supporting his conviction. Thus, defendant was subject to predatory-offender registration. The district court had the authority to require defendant to undergo a psychosexual evaluation as it was imposed as a condition of probation rather than pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.3457 (2004). Defendant's constitutional challenge to Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subd. 1b (Supp. 2005), was rejected as the statute was not punitive. Thus, the Apprendi and Blakely rules did not apply. The statute also did not violate defendant's substantive or procedural rights. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction given the victim's testimony about defendant's physical contact and invasion of privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of six grams or more of cocaine. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to reasonably conclude that there was a strong probability that he was consciously exercising dominion and control over a bag containing the cocaine. Officers saw the bag in close proximity to defendant, lying on the ground about a foot away from him. Defendant stated to one officer that he knew that the bag contained cocaine. However, the trial court violated defendant's right to confrontation by admitting a Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) report without the testimony of the analyst who prepared the report. An officer's testimony was insufficient to satisfy the scientific reliability requirement. The officer's estimate of the number of rocks in the bag did not establish the precise weight of the cocaine, and the weight of the bag and the cocaine together did not establish the weight of the cocaine alone. Thus, without the BCA report, the evidence was insufficient to satisfy the State's burden of proving the weight of the cocaine beyond a reasonable doubt, and the third prong of the plain-error test was satisfied.</SPAN></P>

Expert testimony revealed that the patient suffered from pedophilia, paraphilia, and a personality disorder. These did not allow the patient to adequately control his sexual impulses. Moreover, the evidence showed that the patient was highly likely to engage in future harmful sexual conduct. The patient had returned to his offense cycle after prison terms and offender treatment. The patient also offered no evidence of another less-restrictive treatment facility that was available to accommodate him and still meet the public safety requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender argued that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was highly likely to reoffend; (2) his current in-prison treatment program was an adequate, less-restrictive alternative to commitment; and (3) the statute allowing him to show that there was a less-restrictive alternative was unconstitutional and impossible of execution. However, the appellate court determined that: (1) the offender continued to engage in inappropriate sexual behavior even while residing in a secure facility; (2) due to the offender's numerous past failures in sex offender treatment, and his lack of empathy and insight into his behaviors, there was no evidence to suggest that he would follow through with treatment; (3) although two examiners initially indicated that the offender could be treated in a program other than a secure facility, that program was no longer recommended by the examiners, and thus the commitment statute providing for the least-restrictive alternative was not impossible of execution; and (4) civil commitment under the SDP statute did not violate double jeopardy because such commitment was remedial, and its purpose was treatment rather than punishment.</SPAN></P>

He brought claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1985, for breach of contract, and sought declaratory relief.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among the claims resolved on appeal, the appellate court found no error in the denial of appellant's motion for a declaratory judgment/partial summary judgment related to the city's alleged taking of a 33-foot road easement, the construction of a fence and a walking trail, and the installation of a fiber optic cable because appellant did not establish that the takings occurred. He did not show that he had an interest in the portion of road, and he did not deny the city's allegations of a prescriptive easement, Minn. Stat. &sect; 160.05, subd. 1 (2006). The silt fence was on his property for less than a week. The walking trail was not graded or constructed. The fiber optic cable, while permanent, was installed by a private company operating without a permit. Appellant's claims of breach of contract, third-party beneficiary breach of contract, promissory estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, negligence, and joint concerted tortious conduct, brought in response to a third-party's entry of a restrictive covenant encumbering property that appellant had allegedly contracted to buy, were barred by the six-year statutes of limitations, Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.05, subd. 1(1), (5), and (6) (2006).</SPAN></P>

The petitioner's criminal-history score included one point for a 1989 felony conviction of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle (UUMV), for which he received a stay of imposition of sentence. The petitioner maintained that because the district court stayed the imposition of his sentence for the UUMV conviction and he served less than two years on probation, his criminal-history score for the offense should reflect a misdemeanor disposition. The petitioner sought a modification of his criminal-history score to two. The appellate court ruled that under Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.B.1, the district court correctly assigned one felony point for the UUMV conviction. The classification of the UUMV conviction as a misdemeanor under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.13, subd. 1(2) (2002), did not preclude the district court's later decision in a different context to characterize the conviction as a felony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was arrested after fleeing officers in a vehicle. A delinquency petition was filed. The State asked the trial court to designate the case as extended jurisdiction juvenile (EJJ). The juvenile pled guilty to fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle. The trial court imposed a juvenile disposition and advised the juvenile that if he violated the terms of his probation, it would impose an adult sentence. A probation revocation hearing occurred after the juvenile was involved in a traffic accident with indications that he might have been driving under the influence of alcohol. The trial court revoked the juvenile's probation and imposed a stayed adult sentence of one year and one day and a 60-day term in jail. On appeal, the court found that because the juvenile did not consent to an adult sanction under Minn. Stat. &sect; 260B.130, subd. 4(b) (2004), the trial court retained juvenile jurisdiction only and could not impose an adult sanction against him. Even after the probation violation, juvenile jurisdiction was not terminated. While the trial court could impose new juvenile dispositions pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 260B.198, it had no authority to impose new adult sanctions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner was not denied due process when the city revoked its licenses where it received reasonable notice, a hearing before an impartial administrative law judge, and a hearing by the public safety and regulatory services committee before the revocation. The city did not violate Minn. Stat. &sect; 14.61, subd. 1, where a majority of the committee conducted a hearing and allowed the business owner to present written and oral arguments. The committee's recommendation was properly part of the record the city council considered in rendering its decision. Even though the council should have re-voted following a motion for reconsideration, the council's intent to revoke the licenses was patently clear from the transcript. The revocation decision was supported by substantial evidence where the owner failed to meet the voluntary conditions it had agreed to and had violated the Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances. Finally, the constitutional claims failed as the owner had adequate notice of the alleged violations and received due process, the surveillance camera requirement was not unconstitutionally vague, and imposition of voluntary conditions did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

Upon his release, the patient sued respondent police department (City) on 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and state-law tort claims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the patient contended the district court erred by granting the City's motion for summary judgment. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the patient's complaint was devoid of any allegations that police policy required the officers to act in a manner that violated his constitutional rights. Because the patient did not allege an unconstitutional municipal custom, he necessarily did not allege a pattern of misconduct to which the officers' supervisors could have acted with deliberate indifference or tacitly authorized. Because the patient's complaint lacked the specific allegations were required to maintain a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim against the City, the district court did not err by granting summary judgment to the City. And as the officers were performing discretionary, not ministerial, acts when they detained the patient and transported him to the hospital, the officers were protected by official immunity. The officers had reason to believe that the patient was a danger to himself and others; no reasonable jury could have found that the officers' acts were willful or malicious wrongs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the petitioner argued that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his petition to withdraw his pleas of guilty. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the petitioner was competent to enter his guilty pleas; the judge who accepted the pleas was able to observe and assess the petitioner's general demeanor, his manner of responding to questions, the content of each response, and the petitioner's ostensible understanding of both the context and the particulars of the criminal proceedings, including the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty. The picture that the petitioner presented to the judge was that of an intelligent and lucid individual who was able to follow the questions asked and to give responsive answers. Further, there was nothing in the record to suggest that the petitioner's attorney failed to answer any legal questions for him, or that he failed to discuss defenses as well as charges. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the petitioner's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim failed.</SPAN></P>

The petitioner requested that legal counsel be appointed to represent him. The state public defender declined representation on the ground that Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.51, subd. 1(a) (2004), any person who operated a motor vehicle consented to a chemical test for the purpose of determining the presence of alcohol, a controlled substance or its metabolite, or a hazardous substance. Therefore, defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated because she consented to submit to a chemical test by driving a motor vehicle. Further, Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2, did not violate an individual's Fourth Amendment rights. Defendant also argued that her Miranda rights were violated. Because defendant's statement, &quot;I do not think I should have to take a test&quot; was not in any way incriminatory, the district court's admission of that evidence, even if made in error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, defendant did not raise a reasonable-refusal defense in the district court and had not identified on appeal the grounds on which she could have raised such a defense; therefore, she had not been prejudiced by the admission of the evidence, and the court declined to address the need for a Miranda warning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was involved in several sexual assaults of minor children. After he was committed for meeting the criteria of both a SDP and a SPP, this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the district court's finding regarding the patient's status as a SDP was not in error under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c(a) (2006) because he was highly likely to reoffend in the future, even though the experts in the case reached different conclusions after considering the factors under Linehan I. The record showed that the patient had an ongoing attraction to minor females, he was unable to avoid contact with them, and he did not function well in an unstructured environment. The length of time since the last offense was not persuasive due to his incarceration and high degree of supervision in the community. Next, the patient fell under the criteria for the SPP under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18b (2006) because he lacked the power to control his sexual impulses. The patient's conduct likely caused significant psychiatric disorders, physical harm, and other problems. Finally, a constitutional issue was not heard since it was not presented to the district court.</SPAN></P>

The claimant requested reconsideration, and the ULJ issued an order of affirmance. The appellate court ruled that substantial evidence supported the ULJ's finding. The claimant's testimony about his work history during the period for which he was seeking benefits supported the finding that he was focused on retraining rather than on finding a job. The claimant's testimony on his work history and effort to retrain himself conflicted with his testimony that he would quit school if a suitable job were offered to him. Unemployment benefits were intended to be a temporary wage replacement while individuals found new employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant was responsible for paying a portion of her rent, and she received Section 8 rental assistance. After the tenant failed to pay rent for two months, her landlord filed an eviction complaint. The tenant was notified by MHRA that her rental-assistance benefits would be terminated because she was evicted, and an informal hearing was held. The tenant argued, on appeal, that: (1) the evidence did not support termination of her benefits; (2) the decision was arbitrary and capricious because MHRA failed to consider mitigating circumstances; (3) she was denied procedural due process; and (4) MHRA failed to make adequate findings of fact. 24 C.F.R. 982.552(b)(2) was the applicable provision because it specifically mentioned eviction. The hearing officer did not err in terminating the rental assistance under section 982.552(b)(2). Substantial evidence supported MHRA's decision, and the decision was not arbitrary and capricious. The tenant was not denied procedural due process, and the findings were sufficient to permit meaningful review. The record established that the tenant knew, or had reason to know, of the possible adverse consequence of termination if she was evicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Between 1970 and 1979, appellant was convicted of driving while impaired (DWI) four times, and his driving privileges were revoked, cancelled, and denied as inimical to public safety.

Appellant pled guilty to DWI, his driving privileges were revoked, cancelled, and denied as inimical to public safety. Appellant sought partial reinstatement of his driving privileges for work purposes. The Department argued that the review procedure, including the 180-day limitation in Minn. Stat. &sect; 171.19 (2004), was the exclusive remedy for review. The appellate court ruled that the proper challenge for denial of a license as inimical to public safety or welfare was found in Minn.

The Crow Wing County District Court (Minnesota) found in favor of the county. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the owners purchased a contiguous parcel, their original parcel and the continuous parcel merged into a single, undivided parcel under Crow Wing County, Minn., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 7.5(C)(4) (1972). Crow Wing County, Minn., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 7.7 (1972) did not apply as the change referred to in that provision was the alteration of a physical characteristic of the property, not its legal status. Thus, the county had denied the owners' construction permit application based on a correct interpretation of its ordinance. The district court did not err in declining to permit relitigation of the arbitrary and capricious claim because even though it had not expressly directed a final judgment to be entered and could have reconsidered its ruling under Minn. R. Civ. P. 54.02, the record did not remain open for submission of new evidence. The equal protection claim failed because the neighbors' nonconforming parcel was not the same as the owners' newly created parcel. The county's action was not a taking since merging lots served a legitimate interest in phasing out nonconforming uses and the county's action did not interfere with the owners' investment-backed expectations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) adjudicated defendant juvenile delinquent for aiding and abetting first-degree burglary under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.582, subd. 1(a) and 609.05 (2004). The juvenile challenged the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile's Miranda waiver was voluntary and intelligent where the officer had read him his rights prior to the interrogation, the juvenile indicated that he understood the rights, and the officer had reiterated those rights later during the interrogation. The failure to tape record part of the interrogation did not warrant suppression where the juvenile did not dispute the facts surrounding his Miranda rights or waiver. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction where the juvenile's admission that he was in the garage where the golf clubs later identified as the victim's were stolen from allowed a jury to reasonably conclude that he was in the victim's garage the night it was burglarized. The trial court did not err in failing to secure the juvenile's express waiver of his right to testify as Minn. Stat. &sect; 260B.163, subd. 9, did not establish a statutory right to testify. Thus, the presumption that the decision not to testify was made voluntarily and intelligently unless something in the record suggested otherwise applied. The trial court failed to make the findings required by Minn. R. Juv. Delinq. P. 15.05, subd. 2(A)(1)-(2) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 260B.198, subd. 1(m).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was reversed to the extent that the district court failed to make additional findings addressing why the public safety and the juvenile's interests were not best served by maintaining his current custody and why a new placement was suitable. The judgment was otherwise affirmed. The case was remanded for additional findings.</SPAN></P>

Thus, at the time of defendant's plea agreement, the court had the authority under the amended statute to impanel a sentencing jury.

On appeal, defendant's argument that the prior license revocation could not qualify as an aggravating factor because he was not fluent in English failed. While Minn. Stat. &sect; 611.32, subd. 2 (2004) provided for an interpreter, this statute applied to criminal cases; the license revocation proceeding was civil in nature. The fact that defendant was not represented by counsel was irrelevant.

In light of the testimony establishing that the patient sexually abused nine children over a period of more than 20 years in addition to the frequency of each child's abuse, there was overwhelming evidentiary support for the district court's determination that he engaged in a habitual course of sexual misconduct. Evidence that the patient lacked the ability to control his sexual impulses included his 20-year history of sexual abuse of children, his minimization of the offenses, his failure to take responsibility for sexually abusing two victims despite admitting the abuse, psychological test results that indicated a high risk of sexually reoffending in the future, his failure to participate in sex-offender treatment, and his lack of empathy or insight.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father decided to use a surrogate mother to carry his child. The parties entered into a gestational-surrogacy agreement (GSA) that called for the governance of Illinois law. The GSA was later modified. The district court concluded that, under the Illinois Parentage Act, the father was the child's father, and it denied the surrogate parental rights. The mother cited three reasons in support of her claim that it was unenforceable: (1) the GSA did not reflect the parties' actual agreement, (2) the father coerced the surrogate to sign the GSA, and (3) the GSA contravened the public policy of Minnesota. The record contained no evidence that, by selecting Illinois law, the parties acted in bad faith or with the intent to evade Minnesota law. The record contained significant evidence to support the district court's finding that the parties entered into a written contract and orally modified that contract. The district court also properly concluded that there was no fraud, misrepresentation, undue influence, or coercion by either party in the formation of the contract. Because the record supported the district court's findings, the findings were not manifestly contrary to the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the patient argued that there was not clear and convincing evidence that he met the statutory definitions of an SDP or an SPP; and his indeterminate commitment violated the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto clauses. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the patient's sexual misconduct constituted a course of harmful sexual misconduct sufficient to meet the definition of an SDP; he had been resistant to change and because he reoffended after receiving prior punishment for his actions, his behavior was enduring. The patient sexually assaulted family members, which would result in serious emotional harm to his victims, and his offenses involved multiple acts of sexual contact and/or penetration. As the nature of his sexual offenses was such that they likely caused substantial mental harm to his victims, they were sufficiently egregious and violent in their nature to meet the dangerous-to-others requirement of the SPP definition. Because the patient did not provide any evidence indicating that his civil commitment, even if ineffective, constituted preventive detention, he failed to meet his burden to show that his indeterminate commitment was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

He admitted that the officers smelled alcoholic beverages when they opened his door. He admitted that they noticed that he and the inside of his truck were covered with his vomit and that he vomited again as he stepped from the truck. Petitioner's argument that his illness was caused by exposure to paint fumes was heard and rejected by the district court, and the court deferred to the district court's credibility assessment and its weighing of evidence. Also, petitioner's constitutional challenge to the standard applied to cancel his driving privileges was not compelling.

The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the Section 8 housing choice voucher program did not mandate that the agency prove fraudulent or intentional misrepresentation before terminating a participant's housing assistance; the termination decision was within the agency's discretion pursuant to 24 C.F.R. &sect; 982.552(c) (2006). Further, the hearing officer's inference that the tenant's failure to report was intentional was buttressed by the evidence offered in support of the agency's termination decision, including his prior recertification applications which demonstrated his understanding that he was required to provide information about his employment and income. And the hearing officer's decision was not arbitrary or capricious as the hearing officer did consider whether the tenant's head injury caused his failure to report.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the petitioner contended that he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because, at the time he made the plea, he was deprived of his mental health medication and he pleaded guilty to get out of jail and have access to his medication. The appellate court disagreed, concluding that the district court's finding that the plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent (even though the petitioner's not receiving his medication caused him undue discomfort and anxiety) was supported by the evidence, including his own statements. On his written petition to plead guilty, he indicated that he did not decide to plead guilty in order to expedite his case; in response to questions from his attorney, he said that no one had promised him anything or made any threats to him to induce him to plead guilty; at the sentencing hearing, he admitted that he had told his mother he would burn the house down if she put it up for sale and that he did this to terrorize her and cause her anxiety; and he told the district court he understood the conditions of his probation. At no time did the petitioner ever mention being deprived of his medication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county received complaints about the condition of the owners' property. Unlicensed, inoperable vehicles, including piles of junk, scrap metal, automotive parts, and tires were among the items stored on the property. Over five years, the county tried unsuccessfully to have the property voluntarily cleaned up. The county's efforts included phone calls, letters, on-site visits, and providing a list of businesses that helped with cleanup. The county served the owners with a summons and complaint alleging violation of its zoning and waste management ordinances. The county was awarded default judgment against the first owner and summary judgment against the second owner. The county removed the items and brought the property into compliance with the ordinances. The appellate court ruled that the district court did not err by entering judgment without an eminent domain proceeding and without making the findings required for injunctive relief. Also, the owners were not deprived of due process of law. The state statutes and county ordinances provided a legal remedy for the county after it had attempted to have the property brought into compliance for five years.</SPAN></P>

The trial court stayed imposition of sentence and placed him on probation. On appeal, he argued that Minn.

The court found that defendant failed to sustain his burden of proving that &sect; 514.02 was void for vagueness. The statutory language informed a person of ordinary intelligence of what was prohibited. Further, determining that defendant did not commit theft by swindling did not preclude the jury from also determining that he failed to use payment proceeds to pay for contributions to an improvement to real estate.

The officer pushed the car to the shoulder of the ramp. Defendant restarted the car and began to drive away, but the officer activated her spotlight to indicate to him that he needed to stop because the officer had not yet identified who he was. The officer smelled alcohol coming from defendant's breath and saw that his eyes were red and watery. Defendant was subsequently charged with third-degree refusal to submit to a chemical test and fourth-degree DWI. The trial court denied his motion to suppress. He was convicted of the charges. On appeal, the court concluded that the second encounter between defendant and the officer was a separate stop. The officer's second stop of defendant was not based on a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity. Other than defendant's apparent difficulty in rolling down his car window, which could indicate unfamiliarity with the car, the officer articulated no facts to support a suspicion that the car had been stolen. Before the second encounter, the officer had not smelled alcohol or asked defendant whether he had been drinking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After entering guilty pleas to several charges, defendant sought a downward dispositional departure. The motion was denied, and a sentence of 98 months in prison was imposed. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that, because the amended statute had come into effect before defendant was sentenced, he was entitled to application of the amended language set forth in Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.28, subd. 1(b) (2006). However, concurrent sentences were not mandated by the language of the amendment; the district court retained discretion to impose consecutive sentences. Next, the district court considered the Trog factors when it denied the request for a downward dispositional departure; it cited to defendant's lack of cooperation, his remorse, and his attitude. Defendant had shown that he was not amenable to probation due to previous attempts at treatment, and his mild mental illness was not a justification for a mitigated sentence. He did not present proof that his prior DWI convictions were unconstitutionally obtained, and a misstatement regarding the number of past DWI convictions did not play a part in the sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The board of adjustment (board) determined that the evidence did not establish that the applicant's nonconforming use of the land continued for the relevant period. Additionally, the zoning ordinance was not void for vagueness. Further, it was uncontroverted that the applicant did not seek rezoning. And the board determined only that the applicant had discontinued his use of the property as a salvage yard and, therefore, lost his non-conforming-use status. The board's decision did not constitute a taking. The board's action did not deny the applicant residential or recreational uses of the property. If the applicant sought to rezone the property so that he could operate a salvage yard lawfully and the county denied the rezoning request, the applicant might have a cognizable takings claim. But the narrow decision by the board that the applicant had discontinued his use of the property as a salvage yard was not a taking. Thus, the appellate court affirmed on other grounds the district court's entry of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Relator, a non-student, was hired under a unique arrangement to provide care for her 16-year-old developmentally disabled granddaughter. Relator never worked for any other clients. When the Minnesota Department of Human Services terminated the child's medical-assistance funding, relator as a nonstudent, was no longer qualified for employment. Later, the employer lifted its restriction against nonstudents being employed as personal-care attendants, but did not communicate this change to relator. The ULJ misconstrued the law when it determined that relator was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits based on her failure to ask the company if she could serve any of its other clients. Because a reasonable employee in relator's position would have believed that she was no longer allowed to work for the employer, relator was discharged from employment and not disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant was not convicted for failing to sign the form presented but for refusing to comply with his duty to register. Defendant acknowledged that his case worker repeatedly informed him of his duty to register as a sex offender, but he repeatedly refused to comply with any registration requirement. The fact that a prison official presented defendant with the wrong form did not establish that the State introduced insufficient evidence of his failure to register. A senior official with the predatory-offender registration unit testified that defendant had never registered, and defendant was reminded at least four times while incarcerated of his duty to register. That defendant continuously refused to provide any required information or otherwise facilitate registration supported his conviction despite the erroneous form.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Minnesota sought review of an order from the Otter Tail County District Court (Minnesota), which granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence from an inventory search of his vehicle after it was impounded. Charges against defendant were dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sitting in a parked car on a rural highway. An officer stopped to offer assistance. The officer decided to impound the vehicle based on defendant's inability to drive it, given the lack of proof of insurance and defendant's suspended driver's license. During an inventory search associated with impoundment, the officer found a glass pipe with drug residue. The officer also found two packages methamphetamine in the trunk. Defendant was charged with two first-degree controlled substance crimes. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence from the search of the vehicle. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in its determination that defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution were violated. Because defendant could not demonstrate that his vehicle was insured, it could not be driven by him or anyone else under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.797, subd. 2 (2006). The State provided the trial court with the sheriff's department policy on inventory searches. There was no suggestion, much less any evidence, that the officer acted in bad faith or for the sole purpose of investigation by his course of conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant argued that the arresting police officer lacked sufficient reasonable, articulable suspicion to ask for her driver's license and insurance information after a vehicle accident. She also contended that a portion of the implied-consent statute was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed, finding no indicia of a seizure in the record; the officer never blocked or obstructed defendant's vehicle; he never activated any emergency equipment; he never told defendant not to leave; and his purpose for coming back to her vehicle after he had walked away was to obtain information for an accident report he was obliged to complete. The reasonable person in defendant's position would not have concluded that she was not free to leave; thus, no seizure occurred. And even if it was determined that she was seized, the officer had a reasonable, articulable basis for the seizure based on the totality of the circumstances, which provided the officer with an objectively reasonable basis for to seize defendant to investigate a possible charge of careless driving. And Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2 (2004) did not unconstitutionally deny defendant's U.S. Const. amend. IV rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for being an ineligible person in possession of a firearm, arguing that because he was unlawfully detained in the back seat of a squad car after law-enforcement officers stopped his car, the district court erred by not suppressing the gun, magazine, and ammunition that were found in his car during that detention. The appellate court affirmed however, concluding that the challenged evidence was not discovered as a result of defendant's detention in the squad car. Defendant did not dispute that the stop of his car was lawful, and he conceded that the officers were likely justified in asking him to step out of his car. That concession was supported by caselaw. Because discovery of the gun did not result from the fact that defendant was sitting in the squad car, but from the fact that he was not sitting in the driver's seat of his own car, the appellate court agreed that the gun and accessories were not discovered as a result of defendant's detention in the squad car.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 7a(a) (2006), when it concluded that his 1991 sexual-conduct conviction was based on an act of harmful sexual conduct. The district court specifically found that appellant's three indecent-exposure convictions posed a substantial likelihood of emotional harm. The appellate court agreed with the conclusion that appellant's three convictions of interference with privacy constituted harmful sexual conduct. The record also showed that a doctor applied all six of the Linehan I factors and concluded that there was a high likelihood that appellant would reoffend under &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c(a)(3) (2006). Further, the Minnesota Supreme Court had determined that civil commitment did not violate a person's right against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued, inter alia, that the district court erred by ordering his commitment because he did not pose a high risk to reoffend. The court of appeals disagreed. In addition to the actuarials and tests, the examiners considered the patient's demographic factors, extensive history of sexual misconduct, diagnoses, and lack of successful treatment. Although the patient's history of sexual misconduct was not directly reflected in his convictions, he admitted to five sexual assaults involving manipulation and violence. The assaults, some under the influence of drugs, some not, were characterized by gratuitous violence and humiliation of the victims. One examiner noted that the patient's &quot;entrenched pattern of sexual deviance most likely continues to date.&quot; The patient continued to be an untreated sex offender and his age did not mitigate the high likelihood that he would reoffend due to his history and psychopathy. Therefore, the district court had clear and convincing evidence supporting its determination that the patient was highly likely to reoffend and should be committed as a sexually dangerous person.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court acted within its discretion under Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.02, subd. 4(1). The potential jurors, upon counsel's examination, indicated their willingness to decide the case on its merits, giving credence to those witnesses who were believable. Because the content of the victim's statements to an officer was consistent with her trial testimony and the statements bolstered her challenged credibility, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the statements under Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence in the record tended to indicate that the mother was concerned with the father's use of religion as a tool to manipulate her and the children. The district court restrained the father from discussing &quot;inappropriate&quot; religious ideas in the children's presence or telling them stories or teaching lessons from the Bible. The appellate court determined that although the district court had the authority to place restrictions on the father's religious discussions with his children under Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.003, subd. 3(a) (2006), the order impermissibly burdened his right to free exercise of religion because (1) the district court did not make specific findings indicating that he threatened to subvert her choices regarding the children's religious upbringing, and (2) the language of the order was imprecise and not sufficiently limited. Regarding the content-based restriction on the father's free-speech rights, although the order served the compelling state interest of the best interests of the children, the order was constitutionally infirm because it was not narrowly tailored to fulfill that interest. Also, the order was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed, remanded, and ordered the district court to make specific findings before placing limitations on the father's communication with the children.</SPAN></P>

In May 2004, the district court granted the conservator's petition to sell real estate. In May 2006, the district court filed an order for termination of guardianship and conservatorship, finding that a guardian or conservator would not be of any further assistance. After the conservatee refused to sign the check for the remaining balance issued by the conservator, the conservator placed the remaining $ 473.83 balance in the conservatee's trust account at the center where she resided. The appellate court ruled that the district court did not abuse its discretion. The conservator strictly followed the statutory requirements for terminating the conservatorship under Minn. Stat. &sect; 524.5-431 (2006), and the district court accepted the receipt for discharge filed by the center, even though its termination order requested a receipt from the conservatee. While the conservatee believed she was unjustly deprived of her home, she could not thwart the discharge of the conservator when the statutory requirements for discharge have been fulfilled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree burglary, the Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, imposed sentences of 120 and 60 months to be served consecutively. On appeal, the case was remanded for resentencing. On remand, the the State's motion to empanel a jury for purposes of the departure issues was granted. The district court found three aggravating factors and reimposed its original sentences. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant raised several issues challenging his sentence. The appellate court found that contrary to defendant's assertion, the 2005 amendments to Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.10, subd. 5(a) (Supp. 2005), and the former version of Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.D authorized the district court to impanel a sentencing jury on sentencing of a conviction obtained before the act's effective date and to use the jury's findings to impose a new sentence, including, where appropriate, an aggravated sentence. Furthermore, the retrospective application of the 2005 amendments to &sect; 244.10, subd. 5(a) was not prohibited as an ex post facto law, the use of a sentencing jury to consider aggravating factors in the resentencing hearing did not violate double jeopardy, and the district court properly exercised its inherent judicial authority when it empaneled a sentencing jury to apply the dangerous-offender statute in conformity with Blakely. By virtue of defendant's waiver to his right to a sentencing jury and agreement of the existence of aggravating factors, he also granted the district court the authority to make the &quot;severity&quot; finding with respect to aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's property was zoned RB-2, under which a dwelling occupied by not more than two families was permitted, and accessory buildings could not be designed or used for human habitation. After an inspection revealed three separate dwelling units in the house on the property and a fourth dwelling unit above the garage, the City brought a declaratory judgment action for a declaration that the property was not in conformance with the zoning code and for injunctive relief to compel the owner to restore the property to its permitted use. The owner alleged that her use of the property had been permitted by the City, asserting that storm-sewer pipes located on her property had made a portion of the property unbuildable and unusable, as evidenced by the City's refusal to issue building permits to build in the location of the pipes, constituting an unconstitutional taking. The appellate court ruled that the evidence was undisputed that denial of the permit applications did not deprive the owner of residential or rental use of the property, or prevent other remodeling of the dwelling that did not increase the size of the footprint.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the hearing officer failed to make any findings of fact. The record did not support a finding that no request was made prior to February 2006, because there was no testimony about the dates of the recipient's oral requests. Implicit in the decision was a conclusion that the recipient's niece was actually living with the recipient from September 2005, despite the testimony of the recipient and her niece that this was not true and the testimony of the recipient's social worker that she did not see the niece on any of her twice-monthly visits. The hearing officer did not explain why this testimony was rejected. The hearing officer's failure to even consider mitigating circumstances was a failure to consider an important aspect of the case, given the nature of the violation, the degree of the recipient's culpability, or the effects of termination of assistance on the recipient's children, who were not involved in any violation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought and received downward dispositional and durational departures for some of the convictions, but not others. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the district court erred in its determination of his sentences for both obstructing legal process and first-degree driving while impaired; Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.035, subd. 5 (2002) was unconstitutional; and the criminal-history score exaggerated the seriousness of the offenses. The appellate court agreed that the district court erred in sentencing defendant for obstructing arrest/legal process as defendant was trying to escape from an officer for a crime for which he was stopped; this was generally considered to be part of the same behavioral incident. Defendant failed to meet the heavy burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute was unconstitutional as he argued in generalities and failed to explain why the statute was cruel or unusual in this case. The district court ordered downward durational departures on the sentences for refusal to test and first-degree driving while impaired because it was concerned about not exaggerating the criminality of the offense. The district court did not abuse its discretion here, as these were defendant's fifth and sixth impaired-driving convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of a past conviction, the district court was not authorized to impanel a sentencing jury, and the district court erred by not defining &quot;particular cruelty&quot; for the jury. Applying the Jones factors, the appellate court concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the prior-conviction evidence; use of the &quot;whole person&quot; rationale was well established by caselaw, and under that rationale, defendant's prior conviction had impeachment value. Further, the district court had inherent judicial authority to comply with Blakely by seeking a jury finding regarding whether an aggravating factor existed, regardless of the fact that the sentencing guidelines had not yet been modified to provide for such a procedure. However, the appellate court also found that the district court's omission of a definition of &quot;particular cruelty&quot; was plain error, and that error contributed to defendant receiving a sentence that was an upward departure from the presumptive sentence, thereby affecting his substantial rights.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, finding that the reports and testimony of the State's witnesses established that the patient's conduct created a substantial likelihood of serious emotional harm to another and was, therefore, harmful sexual conduct within the meaning of the commitment statute. Further, and based on the Linehan factors, both experts concluded that the patient was highly likely to reoffend. The district court credited the experts' testimony, including their opinion that certain tests might underestimate the risk of recidivism. The experts' reports and testimony clearly and convincingly supported the district court's determination that the patient was highly likely to engage in future harmful sexual conduct. The court-appointed examiners' reports and testimony, and the patient's extensive history of sexual offenses, supported the district court's determination that the patient lacked adequate control over his sexual impulses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The St. Louis County District Court, Missouri, adjudicated appellant juvenile delinquent on three counts of criminal sexual conduct and consolidated the disposition of these offenses with a probation-violation hearing on a previous sexual offense. Appellant's stay-of-adjudication request was denied, and he was ordered to 120 days of inpatient sex-offender treatment, two years of probation, and to register as a sex offender. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant contended, inter alia, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The appellate court agreed, finding that appellant's attorney advised the trial court that he had a conflict of interest because of his relationship with the mental health center as a board member; appellant's counsel then proposed a way around the conflict that the trial court permitted. While appellant's counsel's efforts to neutralize the conflict were motivated by his intent to try to help appellant by continuing his representation and not requiring appellant to work with a new attorney, the appellate court found that in attempting to evade the conflict, appellant's counsel &quot;actually affected&quot; the representation. An attorney unaffiliated with the mental health center would have been free to contest the allegation that appellant did not sufficiently participate in treatment at the mental health center; instead, the attorney's conflicting obligations effectively sealed his lips on crucial matters. That appellant's attorney actively avoided the issue due to his conflict resulted in a violation of appellant's U.S. Const. amend. VI rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After discovering that relator tenant participated in a check-forgery ring and had a misdemeanor weapons conviction, respondent Minneapolis Public Housing Authority (MPHA) terminated her section-8 rental assistance under 24 C.F.R. pt. 982. A hearing officer determined that the MPHA did not present sufficient evidence to deny rental assistance benefits and reversed, but the MPHA overturned the hearing officer's decision. The tenant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the tenant argued that the MPHA improperly overturned the decision of the hearing officer and that her alleged involvement in criminal activity was an insufficient basis for terminating her assistance. The appellate court agreed, holding that the MPHA's assertion that it was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence only that the tenant was involved in criminal activity was based on an incorrect interpretation of the federal regulations for terminating rental assistance. To establish grounds for terminating benefits based on the alleged violations of 24 C.F.R. &sect; 982.551, the MPHA needed to show that the criminal activity was either in connection with the housing program or was violent. Here, there was no indication that the check forgery was a crime that was committed in connection with the housing program, or that it was a violent offense. Nor was there evidence that the misdemeanor conviction involved the MPHA. Thus, the MPHA's decision was based on an erroneous theory of law and was not supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 325D.71 (2006) that prohibited offering gasoline for sale at a retail price that was lower than a statutory minimum price.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State received complaints that the company was selling gasoline at a price lower than the statutory minimum. On appeal, the company argued that the agency's refusal to consider additional evidence or to grant a rehearing was arbitrary and capricious. The company also argued that the findings were not supported by substantial evidence, and that the statute under which the penalty was imposed was unconstitutional, both facially and as applied to the company. The appellate court agreed with the State that the statute and the applicable rules prohibited the introduction of new evidence after the evidentiary record closed. The documents that company sought to have considered detailed gasoline prices in a metropolitan area, gasoline-terminal prices, and competitors' prices. The documents were evidence, and the parties and the ALJ did not agree to accept this evidence; therefore, it was inadmissible. Consequently, the appellate court concluded that the deputy commissioner's decision not to consider the documents was not arbitrary or capricious. The company did not meet its burden of demonstrating a violation of a constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the Town contended the substantial-evidence test for annexation was not satisfied because only about one-quarter of the land in question was buildable and was part of the national park system; and the ALJ's increase in the amount of land to be annexed was contrary to law. The appellate court found that substantial evidence existed to support annexation, including testimony that approximately 116 acres were buildable and that the property was part of a developing community. Furthermore, the Township's board of supervisors admitted that the property was ripe for development and that the urbanization trend was moving south toward the subject property. The City, unlike the Township, was capable of providing the necessary services to the growing population, such as sewer systems, storm-water management and environmental maintenance of the area. However, the appellate court also found that the municipal-boundary procedures under Minn. Stat. &sect; 414.09, subd. 1(e) (2004) for annexing the owner's homestead and &quot;island&quot; lots were not followed in that the hearing was not recessed and notice was not published.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the tenant was explicitly informed that if her boyfriend began receiving income, the tenant was responsible to report receipt of that income. As such, the officer's legal conclusion that the Authority did not have to establish that the tenant actually knew of the boyfriend's income was correct and was supported by substantial evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the second-degree assault of his son's mother. Two days after the assault, the mother was admitted to the hospital after a miscarriage. Currently, defendant appealed from the district court's aggravated durational departure from the presumptive sentence. The appellate court affirmed however, stating that the evidence of the miscarriage was relevant to establish the extent of the attack. Defendant told his son's mother that he wanted to kill her baby and directed his blows towards her abdomen, which supported the determination that a shovel, when used in that context, was a dangerous weapon. The application of the revised version of Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.10, subd. 5 (Supp. 2005) did not amount to an ex post fact violation because the jury determination posed no more onerous a sentence than authorized previously when the statute allowed for a judicial finding of aggravating sentencing factors. The nature of the assault, occurring as it did between the son's mother and father, as well as the proximity of the boy, and the fact that it took place in the mother's zone of privacy, justified an upward sentencing departure under Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.D.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the inmate challenged the district court's grant of summary judgment on his constitutional claims against the Department's enforcement of a policy prohibiting inmate-to-inmate property transfers via mail. The appellate court found that the policy prohibiting inmate-to-inmate property transfers was rationally connected to the legitimate concern of maintaining a safe and secure institution. Further, he policy did not deprive prisoners of all means of expression, and alternative means of communication between prisoners existed. The Department's assertion that accommodating inmate-to-inmate property transfers would significantly burden prison mailroom staff, require additional resources to implement, and potentially endanger prison inmates, satisfied the reasonableness test. The appellate court concluded that the Department policy prohibiting inmate-to-inmate property transfers had a reasonable relation to the Department's valid interests in maintaining prison security. And as applied here, the policy did not unconstitutionally infringe upon the inmate's U.S. Const. amend. I rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county wanted to acquire the landowners' property to construct a portion of a bicycle trail. The landowners argued that taking their land to construct a bicycle trail was unconstitutional since a bicycle trail was not a public purpose and the bicycle trail could be constructed on an existing highway right of way. The appellate court ruled that the district court's finding that a bicycle trail should be deemed a public purpose was not clearly erroneous. The landowners cited no authority for their implied assertion that a recreational purpose was not a public purpose. Also, the district court's finding that taking the landowners' property was reasonably necessary to further a public purpose was not clearly erroneous. The district court found that constructing the trail on the landowners' land was necessary to provide a connection with other planned trails and avoid a gap in the trail. The district court also found that since the existing highway was a curvy road with moderate to heavy traffic and lots of trucks, a bicycle trail placed on the right of way would be too narrow and too dangerous, and would not accomplish the goal of providing safe transportation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant argued that the trial court erred by determining that the officer's warrantless entry into his garage was justified under the hot-pursuit exception to the warrant requirement. The appellate court disagreed, holding that defendant could not defeat the lawful arrest set in motion in a public place by retreating to a private place. Although the officer did not activate his squad car's emergency lights, when he made eye contact with defendant and turned the squad car around, he made a show of authority. Defendant knew the officer was approaching and attempted to evade him. Once the officer made that show of authority and approached, defendant was not permitted to increase his speed and retreat into his home to avoid a lawful public seizure. Because defendant was aware that an officer was approaching, the hot-pursuit doctrine prevented defendant from increasing his speed, entering his garage, and closing his garage door to defeat a public seizure. As such, the trial court did not err by declining to suppress evidence obtained after the warrantless entry into defendant's garage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the patient argued that the Judicial Appeal Panel erred in determining that he failed to meet his burden of proving that transfer was appropriate. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the patient failed to meet the criteria stated in Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.18, subd. 15 (2006); the patient failed to complete sex-offender or chemical-dependency treatment and the state hospital where he was committed was the only facility that could meet the patient's treatment needs. Further, the patient continued to be a danger to the public. Based on the results of tests designed to measure the risk of future violence, the examiners determined that the patient scored in the high range level for psychopathy, was at a higher risk for re-offense than most offenders studied in the normative sample, and was more likely to commit a future violent offense than to refrain from committing such an act if released into the community. As such, Judicial Appeal Panel did not err in concluding that the patient failed to establish a prima facie case for discharge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty to aiding and abetting first-degree assault, appellant inmate was sentenced to an upward durational departure of 172 months. The Itasca County District Court, Minnesota, stayed execution of the sentence as a downward dispositional departure. The stay was vacated when the inmate violated his probation numerous times, and the original sentence was imposed. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the inmate contended he was entitled to relief under Blakely, arguing that his plea agreement impermissibly required him to waive his right to review. He also argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the aggravating factor of particular cruelty, and thus the upward durational departure could not be imposed. The appellate court disagreed, holding that although the inmate's appeal waiver presented a reason why he would not have challenged his sentence duration on direct review, it was not sufficient to justify deviation from the bright-line rule for a Blakely analysis. The inmate's argument would have had merit if his appeal waiver made it impossible for him to challenge his sentence on direct appeal. But such a waiver could have been challenged, even on direct appeal. Furthermore, because the inmate pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting first-degree assault, the acts of the others who had aided were attributable to him for sentencing purposes under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.05, subd. 1 (2000). And the trial court's finding that the assault was a &quot;savage attack&quot; on the victim that occurred over a long course of time supported a finding of particular cruelty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which denied his postconviction petition challenging a 2005 sentence for felony first-degree driving while impaired (DWI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's argument that Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.276, subd. 1(d), violated the double-jeopardy clause failed because appellant was not sentenced twice (appellant was sentenced once to 42 months in prison with a five-year period of conditional release), and the mandatory imposition of conditional release was not unconstitutional. Because appellant had five prior driving while impaired convictions, the five-year conditional release period was required by statute. Further, appellant's sentence did not exceed the terms of the plea agreement. Also, neither Apprendi nor Blakely prevented the district court from imposing the mandatory five-year period of conditional release. Because the five-year conditional release term was mandated by Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.276, subd. 1(d) (2004), it did not require the district court to make any additional findings of fact. Finally, the terms &quot;supervised release&quot; and &quot;conditional release&quot; were not interchangeable. Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.05, subd. 1, dealt with supervised release, while Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.276, subd. 1(d), referred to conditional release. The statutes did not conflict because they covered completely different concepts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the site permit was issued based on inaccurate setback information provided by the property owners, they were required to apply for a variance, and the district court did not err in interpreting the ordinance to require such. The property owners were afforded adequate time to present their argument. Additionally, the board did not have to describe their physical inspection of the property, even though the board did visit the property, because the reason for the denial was clear from the statement that the property owners' structures were &quot;too close&quot; to the lot lines and the road right-of-way, and the dimensions were provided in the application. The property owners' assertion that a &quot;crucial portion&quot; of the transcript was missing was not supported by a review of the entire record. Further, the property owners had not shown a hardship unique to the land. The reason that the structures went up without compliance with the appropriate setbacks was the property owners' failure to properly stake their property lines, which was their responsibility as landowners. The board's denial was not arbitrary or capricious and was supported by a sufficient factual basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Scott County District Court (Minnesota) of aiding and abetting third-degree murder. The district court sentenced defendant to 150 months in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that there was insufficient evidence to corroborate the accomplice's testimony or to support his conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. There was independent evidence that defendant possessed methamphetamine on the night of the incident. Defendant and the accomplice injected methamphetamine that evening. The victim had a syringe mark on her body and a lethal level of methamphetamine in her system. Defendant's ex-girlfriend testified that defendant told her that the accomplice injected the victim with methamphetamine, and the accomplice admitted that she did so. Defendant told the ex-girlfriend that he had concealed the syringe the accomplice used. That evidence showed that defendant had an association with the victim, and it linked him to the instrumentalities that contributed to her death. There was expert testimony that acute methamphetamine intoxication was a substantial contributing factor to the victim's death. In light of the record, the jury could have reasonably found that defendant's conduct proximately caused the victim's death. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' dissolution judgment awarded respondent mother sole physical custody of their child, and set appellant father's child-support and spousal-maintenance obligations. After much litigation, respondent County sought to collect the father's obligations and arrearages, and the Washington County District Court, Minnesota, entered an administrative income-withholding order, which was sent to the father's employer. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the father argued that the income-withholding order was defective, and that not affording him pre-withholding notice deprived him of due process of law. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that none of the federal authorities the father cited stated that pre-withholding notice was required. Further, the Minnesota statutorily required withholding notice was attached to the dissolution judgment, and stated that when Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.6111 (2004) was satisfied, child support could be withheld from income, with or without notice. Thus, not only did the father receive the statutorily required notice, but lack of the notice would not have precluded withholding. The father's attempt to show that he was deprived of due process of law omitted consideration of the mother's interest in prompt receipt of the amounts he owed her and the state's interest in assuring that the father made those payments. And considering that the father's obligations had been the subject of extensive litigation for over six years, it could not be said that he was unaware of the existence of his obligations, or that his obligations had not been the subject of considerable judicial process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeals, the State appealed from a judgment of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which dismissed charges against four defendants for third-degree controlled-substance crime, sale or aiding and abetting the sale of cocaine in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.023, subd. 1(1) (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' criminal conduct fell within the fourth-degree statute. They argued that the third-degree statute was unconstitutional as applied because the State had discretion to arbitrarily charge either the more severe third-degree or the less severe fourth-degree offense for the same conduct. The district court dismissed the charges as violations of the equal-protection clause as applied to defendants. On appeal, the court found that the third-degree controlled-substance offense of &sect; 152.023, subd. 1(1) (2004) was more specific than the fourth-degree offense. The Minnesota legislature intended the sale of less than three grams of cocaine to constitute a third-degree, rather than a fourth-degree, controlled-substance crime. Thus, the district court erred in ordering the dismissals and the State properly charged defendants for their conduct under the third-degree controlled-substance statute. Defendants failed to show that their third-degree controlled-substance-crime charges constituted as-applied violations of the federal or state equal-protection clauses.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed on the phrase &quot;any evidence.&quot; The portion of the implied-consent law that was declared unconstitutional by the Fedziuk decision did not have an effect on evidence obtained for a criminal DWI proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record supported the determination that defendant was the one who crashed the stolen car. A police officer provided direct eyewitness testimony that she saw defendant leave the stolen car after it crashed and go into a shopping area, and she was later able to identify defendant as the driver of the vehicle. Further, several witnesses said that they saw defendant approach the shopping area from the direction of the accident, and that he was injured, holding a dark coat even though it was cold outside, and acting strangely. Also, because the police officer's testimony established that defendant drove the stolen vehicle, and the owner of the vehicle testified that she did not know or recognize defendant and that she had not given anyone permission to use the vehicle, the evidence was sufficient to support his motor-vehicle theft conviction. Also, defendant's conduct, shown by his prior convictions for financial-transaction fraud, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, third-degree burglary, theft, fifth-degree controlled-substance crime, motor vehicle theft, and fleeing a peace officer in a motor vehicle, was sufficient to satisfy Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the employee challenged the ULJ's denial of unemployment benefits, contending that she had a daily chiropractor's appointment because of her injury, that her appointments explained her absences, that the employer knew about the appointments and refused to accommodate her, and that employer discharged her to end her workers' compensation benefits. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the record supported the ULJ's determination that the employee quit her employment, and that others at the company did not know of the employee's ongoing chiropractor appointments. The employee was told to inform the employer of any appointments, but she did not. The record did support the determination that four people expressly told the employee to report to work as scheduled, and that letters provided to the employee stated that she was scheduled to work. The record supported the ULJ's finding that the employee was stubborn and unjustified in her refusal to return to work; she defiantly refused to leave when she was not to be at work, and defiantly refused to return when she was to be at work. Further, the record established that the ULJ conducted a fair and unbiased hearing.</SPAN></P>

Because this issue was not raised before the trial court, the factual record regarding the deputy's reading of the implied-consent advisory was insufficient to facilitate review, even if the appellate court was so inclined.

The affidavit contained no description of the bags and no basis for suspecting that they contained drugs, and the relative was not alleged to have been connected with drugs. Even when the facts in the affidavit were considered as a whole, there was still no nexus between the suspect's drug activities and the apartment. As such, the warrant was not supported by probable cause and the trial erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress the gun found in his apartment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to second-degree arson. The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) sentenced defendant to the statutory maximum, after finding that he met the criteria set forth in Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2. The court reversed and remanded the sentence, finding that the dangerous-offender statute was unconstitutional. The Minnesota Supreme Court granted further review, vacated the court's opinion, and remanded for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's inherent authority to impanel a sentencing jury existed even after the 2005 amendments to Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2, the dangerous offender statute were passed, as those amendments did not apply to defendant's offense. The district therefore had inherent judicial authority to impanel a sentencing jury, and it could have exercised that authority if defendant had not waived his right to a jury. Also, defendant cited no legal authority holding that due process required that he be informed of the permissibility of sentencing departures at the time he committed the offense. Additionally, the notion that jury sentencing factfinding would have violated the Ex Post Facto Clause was without merit. By its terms, the Ex Post Facto Clause applied to legislation, not to court decisions. Finally, defendant's criminal behavior supported the finding that he was a danger to public safety. Because defendant had four violent crimes, which was twice the minimum required, and because they occurred over a 23-year period, the 120-month sentence was not disproportional to the seriousness of his conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The Itasca County District Court, Minnesota, imposed a 240-month sentence under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2 (2002), the dangerous-offender statute, which was a departure from the presumptive 161-month sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that although certain findings established a basis upon which the district court could have found that defendant was a danger to public safety, the district court did not actually find that defendant was a danger to public safety. Defendant asserted that because this finding was not articulated on the record at the time of sentencing, the departure under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2, must be disallowed and defendant was entitled to be sentenced to the 161-month presumptive sentence. The appellate court disagreed with defendant's argument. The failure to specifically find that defendant was a danger to public safety did not invalidate his sentence under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2. When sentencing under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2, it was important to make specific findings that complied with the requirements of the statute, but there was nothing to suggest that Minnesota Supreme Court precedent intended to impose a mandatory requirement for findings that involved a sentence imposed under Minn.

The district court ruled that defendant was driving his vehicle faster than the posted speed limit. Defendant argued that the evidence did not support the verdict, that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, and that the district court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence documents that were not produced during discovery. The elements of a violation of Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 474.30, were that the driver (1) started or accelerated a vehicle (2) with an unnecessary exhibition of speed (3) on a public or private way (4) within the city limits. The record was entirely devoid of any evidence that defendant started or accelerated the vehicle with an unnecessary exhibition of speed.

The juvenile appealed, arguing that, as applied to juveniles, the mandatory registration requirement in Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subd. 1(a)(1)(iii) violated the Sixth Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the separation-of-powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declined the juvenile's invitation to reexamine its prior holding that the registration statute, as applied to juveniles who were adjudicated delinquent for listed offenses without jury trials, did not violate due-process rights. The registration statute was civil/regulatory in nature and did not trigger the constitutional due process and Sixth Amendment rights. Also, because registration was not punitive, it was not a sentence enhancement, and the juvenile's constitutional challenges to the registration statute based on Apprendi and Blakely were without merit. Finally, even if the requirement could have been considered to be a part of the sentence, the registration statute did not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine because the legislature could limit the exercise of judicial discretion in sentencing. The court reissued its invitation to the legislature to reexamine the wisdom of imposing predatory offender registration on all juveniles adjudicated of predicate offenses, particularly in the context of cases in which there was record evidence that the juvenile delinquent was not a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With respect to the six issues raised by the juvenile on appeal, the appellate court found that, although the district court should have held an omnibus hearing, the juvenile failed to object or raise the issue, which created a presumption of waiver, Minn. R. Juv. P. 10.02, 11.02, 12.01. Because the juvenile did not raise his right to testify on the record, there was a presumption that his decision not to testify was made voluntarily and intelligently, Minn. Stat. &sect; 260B.163, subd. 10(a) (2006). Although a photographic lineup was unnecessarily suggestive, the identifications were reliable under the totality of the circumstances. The evidence was sufficient to support the juvenile's conviction. The district court did not violate Minn. R. Juv. P. 15.04(5). However, the district court's order for out-of-home, residential treatment was not supported by sufficient findings, as required under Minn. R. Juv. P. 15.05 and Minn. Stat. &sect; 260B.198, subd. 1(m)(2) (2006), because the findings did not indicate why the placement was in the juvenile's best interests, why his current custodial arrangement was not appropriate, and why the particular placement was appropriate and beneficial.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the initial pat search of defendant did not violate his constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Also, probable cause for an arrest existed before the second search. Also, there was probable cause to believe that defendant had committed a criminal activity unrelated to the traffic stop because (1) the officer, who was trained and experienced in detecting drugs by sight and odor, detected the smells of marijuana and burnt methamphetamine coming from inside the vehicle; (2) the officer had personal knowledge of defendant's past narcotics violations; and (3) the pat-down search of the passenger yielded drugs and paraphernalia.

The court of appeals disagreed. On May 4, 2005, a police officer applied for a warrant to search defendant's residence. The district court signed the search warrant on May 5, 2005. On May 10, 2005, police officers executed the search warrant. During execution of the search warrant, defendant arrived home and was searched. Officers found a substance in his pocket that tested positive for cocaine. In his search-warrant application, the officer indicated that he received numerous complaints from anonymous citizens who suspected narcotics trafficking occurring at defendant's residence. A controlled buy was set up within 72 hours of the officer applying for the search warrant and the informant purchased cocaine from defendant. The search-warrant application supported probable cause existing five days after the search warrant was issued because the affidavit showed that defendant was in an ongoing business of selling drugs from his residence. Therefore, the district court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, Olmsted County, petitioned the Olmsted County District Court, Minnesota, for the civil commitment of appellant, a known sexual offender. The district court granted the petition and committed appellant as a sexual psychopathic personality (SPP) and a sexually dangerous person (SDP) for an indeterminate period pursuant to the Minnesota Commitment Treatment Act (MCTA). This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sufficient evidence supported appellant's commitment as an SPP, Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18b (2006), and an SDP, Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c(a), (b) (2006). His commitment as an SPP was supported by clear and convincing evidence. Appellant's past conduct involving sexual assault, kidnapping and rape, and attempted sexual assault established a habitual course of sexual misconduct. Appellant had a demonstrated inability to control his sexual impulses, and expert testimony confirmed that he was unchanged from the time he committed the assaults and thus was dangerous to other persons. Likewise, clear and convincing evidence established that appellant met the criteria for SDP commitment. Appellant did not rebut the statutory presumption that his past conduct, including attempted sexual assault, constituted a course of harmful sexual conduct, Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 7a(b). Experts testified that appellant suffered from a personality disorder, and the record supported a finding that he was likely to engage in future acts of sexual misconduct. Also, appellant did not establish the availability of a suitable, less restrictive treatment program, Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.185, subd. 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, Olmsted County, petitioned the Olmsted County District Court, Minnesota, for the civil commitment of appellant, a known sexual offender. The district court granted the petition and committed appellant as a sexually dangerous person (SDP) and a sexual psychopathic personality (SPP) for an indeterminate period pursuant to the Minnesota Commitment Treatment Act (MCTA). This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sufficient evidence supported appellant's commitment as an SDP, Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c(a), (b) (2006), and as an SPP, Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18b (2006). The record, including expert testimony, established that appellant satisfied the criteria for SDP commitment. Appellant's past actions, including an assault and a sexual assault for which he was imprisoned, as well as 13 sexually related disciplinary infractions he committed while in prison, constituted a course of harmful sexual conduct. Experts testified that appellant suffered from an antisocial-personality disorder, and the record supported a finding that he was likely to engage in future acts of sexual misconduct. There was also strong evidentiary support for appellant's commitment as an SPP. Experts testified that appellant's assault, sexual assault, and numerous sexually related disciplinary infractions constituted repetitive behavior that established a habitual course of sexual misconduct. His recidivism pattern and lack of regard for sanctions showed his inability to control his sexual impulses. Also, appellant did not have a relapse-prevention plan in place, and he did not know what triggered his behavior.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Mille Lacs County District Court, Minnesota, convicted defendant on four counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and on lesser-included offenses of third- and fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. Defendant's motions for a new trial and for a downward durational departure were denied, and he was sentenced to 144 months. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the definition of &quot;position of authority&quot; under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.341, subd. 10 (2004) was unconstitutionally vague, and the trial court erred in instructing the jury on lesser-included offenses. The appellate court found that &quot;position of authority&quot; had previously been determined not to be unconstitutionally vague. Further, defendant was the victim's horseback-riding instructor, fed her and provided her with transportation when she stayed at his farm, and effectively acted as her guardian. For these reasons, and based on the plain language of the statute, defendant held a &quot;position of authority&quot; over the victim within the meaning of the statute. However, the appellate court agreed that the jury instructions and verdict forms confused the jury and deprived defendant of a fair trial, and that this confusion may have resulted in a harsher verdict than might otherwise have been rendered, entitling defendant to a new trial. If the jury had truly understood the relationship between the greater- and lesser-included offenses, it would have found defendant guilty of first-degree criminal sexual conduct or third-degree criminal sexual conduct, but not both.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Nobles County District Court, Minnesota, convicted defendant of driving while impaired (DWI) and an open-bottle violation. Defendant was sentenced to 42 months in prison, but execution of the sentence was stayed; he was ordered to serve one year in the county jail and placed on probation for five years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and the use of his civil license revocation to enhance his conviction violated his due-process and equal-protection rights. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the testimony of the officers that they observed defendant behind the wheel of the tractor with the keys in the ignition, and that his companion would not have been able to drive or control the tractor from her position in the tractor, supported a finding that defendant was in physical control of the tractor while he was intoxicated. The appellate court also found that defendant was not entitled to have a court-appointed attorney for the civil revocation proceeding because he was not facing any confinement. And contrary to defendant's assertion, Blakely did not apply as it related only to sentencing issues and had no application to the distinction between civil and criminal proceedings or the effect a civil finding might have had on potential criminal sentences. And because Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.24, subd. 1(1) (2004) did not create any classifications on its face or by inference, defendant's equal protection challenge failed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the stop did not violate defendant's right to be free from unreasonable government intrusion, and the district court did not err in denying his motion to suppress. The officer stopped defendant on the reasonable suspicion that defendant or his passenger were involved in or had knowledge of reported suspicious activity or were in need of assistance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer stopped defendant for obstructing traffic, and later arrested him for driving while impaired. The State argued that defendant violated a Minneapolis ordinance when he entered an intersection even though he could not clear the intersection because the traffic ahead of him was stopped. The district court determined that because defendant entered the intersection legally, he did not needlessly, unnecessarily, or unwarrantedly obstruct traffic. The appellate court ruled that regardless of whether defendant entered the intersection on a green light, it was uncontested that his vehicle obstructed traffic, and the ordinance applied in all circumstances in which a vehicle obstructed traffic needlessly. The officers had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant violated Minneapolis, Minn., Code Ordinances &sect; 466.230 (1991). The ordinance prohibited obstructing traffic needlessly, and it was uncontested that defendant obstructed traffic by entering the intersection when he could not clear it.

The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the patient contended there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that he was a SDP, that his civil commitment violated his constitutional right to adequate treatment, and that his civil commitment constituted double jeopardy. The appellate court disagreed, finding that civil commitment was proper even though the patient's harmful sexual conduct took place while he was a juvenile. And contrary to his assertion, the possibility that the patient did not know that his conduct was wrong did not controvert, but in fact supported, his need for treatment. Because the evidence sufficiently supported the conclusion that the inmate had engaged in a course of harmful sexual conduct, had manifested a sexual or mental disorder or dysfunction, and was likely to engage in acts of harmful sexual conduct, the trial court did not improperly determine that there was clear and convincing evidence that he satisfied the criteria for commitment as an SDP. Further, the patient failed to establish that a less-restrictive treatment program would meet his needs.

The court also held that the district court erred in awarding conduct-based attorney fees under Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties stipulated that defendant had at least five prior felony convictions for purposes of career-offender sentencing under Minn.

During the sentencing phase, after hearing evidence regarding defendant's prior robbery and theft-related convictions, the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed each of the five instant offenses as part of a pattern of criminal conduct. Defendant challenged his sentence, which was an upward durational departure, arguing that the district court lacked inherent authority to submit aggravating factors to a jury during the sentencing phase of the trial. The appellate court ruled that the district court possessed inherent authority to empanel a sentencing jury to find sentencing factors. The district court bifurcated the trial. After phase one of the trial in which the jury found defendant guilty of five of the six counts with which he was charged, the district court submitted aggravating sentencing issues to the jury during phase two of the trial. The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that each of these offenses were committed as part of a pattern of criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a petition was filed to commit appellant, a sexual offender, as a sexually dangerous person (SDP) and a sexual psychopathic personality, the Hennepin County District Court, Missouri, filed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order committing him to the Minnesota Sex Offender Program as a SDP. The district court ultimately issued an order committing the offender for an indeterminate period. The offender appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that competent evidence, including expert testimony and evidence on the Linehan factors, supported the offender's indeterminate commitment as an SDP because the offender was highly likely to reoffend. Also, the Minnesota SDP Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c (2004), was not unconstitutional as applied to the offender. Although the act did not distinguish between a recidivist, like the offender, and sexually dangerous offenders, as the act was narrowed by Linehan, it adequately distinguished between the typical recidivist and the dangerous sexual offender and thus complied with substantive due process requirements. The act was not void for vagueness because, taken in context, the act's &quot;adequate control&quot; language related to the offender's history of harmful sexual conduct, his high likelihood of future dangerousness, chemical dependency, and antisocial personality disorder. The offender's civil commitment did not constitute double jeopardy because the act was predominantly remedial, not punitive. Moreover, it was facially civil, and it was not so punitive in purpose or effect to trigger the federal constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's judgment for the indeterminate commitment of appellant was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On numerous occasions in 2005, appellant, then fifteen years old, babysat the six-year-old victim. In September 2005, the victim disclosed to her mother that appellant had inappropriately touched her. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the appellate court found that there was sufficient evidence to support appellant's adjudication of delinquency for second-degree criminal sexual conduct. The victim offered graphic and disturbing testimony regarding appellant's sexual conduct. Although the district court did not find the victim's testimony credible enough to establish penetration, the testimony was sufficient to support the district court's adjudication. Appellant's proposition that a failure to establish penetration precluded a finding of sexual contact defied logic, as not all sexual contact required penetration. Also, adjudication of delinquency was not a criminal proceeding, nor was predatory-offender registration a punitive sanction. The appellate court has previously rejected challenges to the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166 (2006), the predatory-offender registration statute as applied to juveniles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying action arose when the State, through its then secretary of state, entered into and later cancelled a service contract with a company to maintain the statewide voter registration system. On review, the citizen argued that he had standing to bring his action as a taxpayer whose tax burden could be increased by illegal spending. The appellate court disagreed, holding that the citizen failed to show that he was the proper party to bring this lawsuit because (1) he failed to show a direct injury distinct from the public's injury; (2) he failed to identify express statutory authority to bring the action; and (3) he failed to show that the State, by its letter of agreement to cancel the original service contract, unlawfully disbursed public money or acted illegally. Neither the citizen nor the legislative auditor report identified &quot;illegal&quot; action. Moreover, the citizen did not challenge the legality of the original contract, which gave the secretary of state's office sole discretion and authority to cancel. The citizen's mere disagreement with that office's cancellation of the contract was insufficient to confer standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested when information was obtained from defendant's roommate; the roommate had been arrested on an unrelated outstanding warrant when an informant reported seeing defendant unloading stolen items at the roommate's trailer home. On review, defendant argued that police lacked probable cause to arrest him and used coercive tactics to obtain his confession. The appellate court disagreed, finding that information obtained from various sources directly linked defendant to items taken during that burglary, including a gun that the informant claimed defendant was trying to sell and a boat motor that was found in the defendant's bedroom. Furthermore, information obtained from the roommate was corroborated by other information already held by police. The appellate court concluded that the police had probable cause to arrest defendant because they had facts and circumstances that would have warranted a prudent person to reasonably conclude that defendant had committed a crime. While the investigator's methods were designed to obtain information from defendant, they were not so oppressive as to overcome defendant's will and produce an involuntary admission of guilt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant smelled of alcohol, and admitted that she had been drinking. Defendant agreed to take a breath test; based on the results, the officer arrested her.

The appellate court held that defendant was not seized when the officer parked his police car two car-lengths away from her car. Defendant could have backed up and driven out of the parking lot.

The affidavit's only mention of defendant's residence was the statement that &quot;during the interview with defendant, deputies learned that he had been living at his mother's residence.&quot; The affidavit stated that nine bags of a crystal-like substance were found in defendant's car near where he was sitting and that defendant lived at his mother's home. The affidavit contained no allegations or facts linking the drugs in the vehicle to defendant's residence. Because the affidavit failed to allege any connection between the residence and drug activity, the district court erred by issuing the search warrant.

The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the facts enumerated in the search warrant application supported the issuance of the warrant because recent events associated with the apartment, including the connection of those arrested for drug use and the observance of drug paraphernalia there, established a fair probability that other evidence of drug activity would be found in the apartment. Knowledge that defendant had an extensive criminal history also supported issuance of the warrant. Allowing the unannounced nighttime entry was proper as defendant had a criminal history that included convictions for second-degree murder and drug possession, so officers were reasonably concerned for their safety. Discrepancies in the witness's descriptions of the gun and inconsistencies in identification of the gun's owner justified exclusion of this testimony. Because defendant's sentencing hearing occurred after the effective date of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2 (2004), his sentence was authorized by law.</SPAN></P>

While defendant argued the implied-consent statute was declared unconstitutional in Fedziuk, defendant's reliance on Fedziuk was misplaced. Fedziuk did not render unconstitutional the entire implied-consent advisory; it only struck down the 2003 amendment to the implied-consent statute which dispensed with the judicial-review requirement. The legitimacy of the advisory was never at issue. Defendant did not claim that the lack of judicial review coerced her into submitting to a breath test or otherwise prejudiced her interests.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, his counsel, and one of his parents signed the statement of rights form, the form explained the trial rights afforded to him and that the consequence of pleading guilty included waiving these rights, and defendant confirmed that he had sufficient time to speak with his attorney before pleading guilty. And contrary to defendant's assertion, the victim timely filed the affidavit requesting restitution with the court administrator pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 611A.045, subd. 1(a) (2004).

The appellate court disagreed, finding that a rational jury could have determined that the victim's testimony regarding it raining on the day of the incident to be credible based on the reasonable possibility that it might rain in March in Minnesota. Although the victim also testified that she did not remember the exact time of year the abuse occurred, her testimony on the details of the abuse was consistent with her videotaped statement to police and her statement to her treating psychologist. The appellate court deferred to the jury's determination of credibility and concluded the evidence sufficiently supported defendant's conviction. Further, the trial court properly exercised its discretion by determining that no victim statements existed in the victim-services records based on the director's testimony and by declining in camera review.</SPAN></P>

He was later charged with escape from custody under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.485, subd. 2(5) (2004). After he was convicted, defendant sought review. In affirming, the appellate court held that &sect; 609.485 did not violate equal protection based on the fact that it allowed persons that had been found not guilty by reason of mental illness or mental deficiency to avoid a felony charge if they returned within 30 days, but did not have a similar provision for a SDP. These two classes were not similarly situated since the commitment criteria were not the same, the treatment was not the same, and the Minnesota Legislature clearly provided that they were dissimilar in certain circumstances. The rational basis test would have been applicable if defendant had been able to show a similar situation. Finally, the use of the necessity defense was properly denied because defendant had not exhausted all available legal remedies, there was no emergency or imminent harm, and the escape did not prevent a harm that would have significantly exceeded the harm resulting from the escape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners owned approximately 37 acres of real property located in Agricultural District A-40 in Stearns County. The land was subject to the County zoning ordinance. The owners applied for a construction permit to build a single-family dwelling but were denied by the Stearns County Environmental Services Department. The property was found to have a Land Evaluation Site Assessment (LESA) score of 77.91, thereby requiring a conditional use permit (CUP). The Stearns County Environmental Services informed the owners of the need for a CUP. The owners submitted an application for a CUP to build a single-family residence on the northwest corner of the property. The County denied the CUP as requested but granted a permit on the condition that the owners build the house on the property's northeast corner. The appellate court ruled that when all relevant provisions were read together, the County ordinance was not vague. The ordinance cross referenced and directed a reader to and through the relevant sections and subsections. Contrary to the owners' belief, the LESA system was objective, organized, and clearly identified the criteria considered in reaching a property's LESA score.</SPAN></P>

Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.791, subd. 2 (2004) was incompatible with the claim by law enforcement that, absent any other circumstances, their departmental policy mandated towing away all cars immediately upon the driver's failure to have his proof of insurance card in his possession. The issuance to defendant of a citation was in line with the statute but not the immediate towing of the vehicle. The officer's claim that the vehicle needed to be towed because it presented a traffic hazard was not supported by the record, and the State failed to provide any documents that it was the department's policy to tow all uninsured vehicles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential informant called the drug task force and told them that defendant would be leaving a bowling alley and driving west with methamphetamine and marijuana in his possession. Presumably a special agent for the task force knew the confidential informant's name because the special agent testified that he had worked with the confidential informant in the past. But there was no indication that the confidential informant had provided reliable information in the past, was making statements against his interest, was voluntarily cooperating with law enforcement, or met with police face to face, any of which could be cited as reasons to credit the confidential informant's tip. Also, defendant's acts of leaving a bowling alley and driving west were innocent activities that became no more suspicious because of the confidential informant's tip. Although the confidential informant's tip was sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion to justify the stop of defendant's vehicle, it was insufficient to establish probable cause to arrest or search defendant and his car under the Fourth Amendment and Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota), which convicted him of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. He also challenged the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of having sexual contact with his girlfriend's 10-year-old son. During the trial, defendant consented to the State's request to close the courtroom. The district court imposed a sentence of 216 months, which was an upward durational departure. This appeal followed. In partially affirming, the appellate court determined that defendant waived his challenge to the decision to close the courtroom due to his consent given through his attorney. Even so, the constitutional right to a public trial was not absolute, and safeguarding the well-being of a minor victim of sexual assault was an overriding interest that justified the limited closure of a courtroom under Minn. Stat. &sect; 631.045 (2004). As to the sentence imposed, the district court had the authority to submit the aggravating factors to the jury under Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.D (2004). However, it was error to make an upward departure based on multiple acts or forms of penetration because only a single act of sexual abuse with one form of penetration occurred on the date of the charged offense; other incidents did not arise out of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was reversed, and the case was remanded for the imposition of the presumptive guidelines sentence. The rest of the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from statements he allegedly made to a county court administrator. According to the administrator, defendant was extremely angry and stated &quot;the Judge was driving him crazy,&quot; and &quot;Do I have to be another Timothy McVeigh?&quot; The administrator composed a summary of her conversation with defendant and brought it to the sheriff's office. The appellate court disagreed with defendant's assertion that his conviction for terroristic threats must be reversed because the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his statement was intended to terrorize and was anything more than an expression of transitory anger. There was circumstantial evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer intent to terrorize. The reference to Timothy McVeigh would carry more weight in light of the fact that Timothy McVeigh was convicted of bombing a government building. Considering the context in which the statement was made, the statement, at the least, was made with reckless disregard of the risk of causing terror. However, the conviction for fifth-degree assault was vacated because it was a lesser-included offense of terroristic threats.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting and second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon, the Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, accepted his plea and later imposed the negotiated aggregate sentence of 190 months. Defendant's subsequent motion for postconviction relief was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the record was insufficient to support the trial court's determination that his guilty plea to an assault count did not result in manifest injustice. He also argued that the 10-month upward departure based on aggravated factors was unconstitutional because the facts underlying the departure were not determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the complaint against defendant alleged that his accomplice pointed his pistol at a victim. At his plea hearing, defendant admitted more than once that he participated in the shooting with his accomplice. He also stated that he understood the legal principle of aiding and abetting. The combination of the allegations in the complaint and defendant's testimony provided the necessary link for finding a sufficient factual basis for the charge that he aided and abetted the assault on the victim. The confusion at the plea hearing did not undermine the factual basis for defendant's plea and it did not result in his pleading guilty to a more serious charge. And under current law, defendant's upward departure did not violate his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court determined that it would submit to the jury the issue of whether defendant's current offense was part of a pattern of criminal conduct within the purview of the career-offender statute. Defendant objected on the ground that the law did not permit a jury to make this determination. The district court overruled the objection. Defendant then moved to impanel a new jury for this proceeding, but the district court denied the motion. Defendant stipulated that his current offense was a felony and that he had five or more prior felony convictions, as required by the career-offender statute. The State then presented evidence of the circumstances of defendant's prior convictions which consisted of two burglaries, one attempted burglary, two receiving stolen goods, and one attempt to offer forged checks, all between 1995 and 2002. The appellate court ruled that the district court had authority to impanel a sentencing jury to determine the aggravating factor of a pattern of criminal conduct under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 4 (2004). Also, the record provided no indication that the performance of defense counsel was objectively unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the instant case, the district court did not expressly recite either the second or third Austin factor. Rather the district court stated it was basing revocation on defendant's admission that he failed to remain law abiding as required by the terms of his probation. Defendant, represented by counsel, actively negotiated and agreed that the district court could revoke his probation and execute his stayed sentence in exchange for lenient sentences on two pending criminal charges and the dismissal of a third charge. The appellate court ruled that because defendant voluntarily admitted to probation violations and agreed to the execution of a stayed sentence in exchange for prosecutorial leniency, the underlying policy reasons for the district court to convey its substantive reasons for revocation and the evidence relied upon did not apply. Also, defendant had the right to have a jury determine any aggravating sentencing factors at the time he made a valid waiver of such rights. Defendant could waive his constitutional right to a jury trial as long as the waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.</SPAN></P>

In March 2006, the trial court denied the father's motion for parenting time, finding that no change in circumstances had occurred since its 2003 and 2004 orders to warrant a modification of parenting time. The appellate court ruled that the father did not present any changed circumstances to the district court to support the modification or suggest that the modification would be in his child's best interests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was convicted in Wisconsin of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated in June 2004. The driver's operating license was revoked for 30 days beginning June 21, 2005. The driver was later arrested in Minnesota for driving while impaired (DWI). The June 2005 license revocation was used to enhance the DWI charge brought against the driver. In October 2005, the driver filed a petition for a hearing under Minn. Stat. &sect; 171.19 (2004) to determine whether she was subject to license revocation based on the June 2004 Wisconsin conviction. The district court ordered the Commissioner to remove all references to the June 2005 license revocation from the driver's operating record. The appellate court ruled that the driver's petition was untimely, and the district court should not have exercised its jurisdiction to hear the petition. Also, because the driver had an opportunity to assert the claim she was not afforded the right to consult with an attorney prior to testing following her Wisconsin arrest in a timely petition for judicial review, but failed to do so, it was not fundamentally unfair and a denial of due process to not allow her to assert the claim in an untimely petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon respondent County's request to have appellant patient committed as a sexually dangerous person (SDP), the Crow Wing County District Court, Minnesota, found that the patient engaged in a course of harmful sexual. The patient was committed to a secure treatment facility for an indeterminate commitment as an SDP. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the patient challenged his commitment. The appellate court found that the testimony of several victims, including minors, and two court-appointed experts constituted clear and convincing evidence that the patient engaged in a course of harmful sexual conduct that caused serious physical and emotional harm to the victims. Although the patient had not been convicted of a criminal sexual offense for over 10 years, he had been either incarcerated, on probation, or on intensive supervised release since his the offense. During that time, despite supervision, he had new criminal convictions, developed a chemical dependency problem, and continued to engage in high-risk behavior including accessing pornography, keeping weapons, and drinking. The patient also failed five sexual offender treatment programs. These facts, as well as the experts' opinions, supported the trial court's finding that the patient was highly likely to reoffend sexually. Because the patient failed to sustain his burden of proving that a less-restrictive appropriate treatment program was available, the trial court did not err by ordering his commitment to a secure treatment facility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for speeding. Defendant consented to a search of the vehicle, and a search of the trunk revealed a detergent box that contained approximately one pound of a white powder that was later determined to be cocaine. Defendant moved to suppress the cocaine, arguing that the traffic stop was unconstitutionally extended. The district court determined that the facts did not amount to grounds for the reasonable, articulable suspicion necessary to extend the traffic stop, noting that the air freshener and the religious icon depicting the patron saint of narcotics smugglers was not sufficient to indicate contraband, that a messy car was not unusual after a long trip, and that defendant's nervousness was reasonable. The appellate court ruled that the State failed to show that the district court clearly and unequivocally erred. The discrepancies in the statements made by defendant and the passenger were not sufficient to justify a reversal. Also, the religious icon was of limited value in establishing a reasonable suspicion.</SPAN></P>

The parties reached a settlement agreement under which the claimant and his wife were each paid $ 300,000. The claimant did not dispute that the plain language of Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.04, subd. 1 and 1a (2006), limited the amount that he could recover from respondents at $ 300,00. The claimant challenged the provision in Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.04, subd. 1a, that excluded professional employees from the limitation. The claimant argued that applying Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.04 to the employee when he had valid private insurance violated equal-protection and due-process. The appellate court ruled that the claimant did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statutory exception, because he had not shown direct, personal harm from the alleged constitutional violation. If the exception were severed from the remainder of the statute, the claimant would be left with a statute that limited respondents' liability at $ 300,000, and respondents had already paid that amount. The claimant would be in the same position whether or not the statutory exception for the liability of professional employees was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the district court did not err in concluding that none of the patient's claims were appropriate for habeas corpus review, and that the patient did not allege facts implicating the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The patient was placed in the behavior therapy unit because of his disruptive behavior, which had to be dealt with to ensure a safe environment for other patients. The restrictions that the patient complained of fall well within Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.185, subd. 7(b) (2004). The most dangerous and aggressive patients resided in the behavior therapy unit, and its restrictions were related to the legitimate purpose of maintaining a secure and therapeutic environment that adequately protected the patients, the staff members, the public, and the facility.</SPAN></P>

Because the district court acted within its discretion by imposing the double durational departure and because the constitutional arguments in his se brief did not present a basis for reversal, the appellate court affirmed. Defendant's alcohol concentration of .26 was an appropriate aggravating favor in Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.21, subd. 1(4) (2004). The district court also did not abuse its discretion in considering defendant's decayed DWIs. Defendant's argument that his conduct was no more serious than the &quot;normal&quot; criminal-vehicular-homicide case was not supported by the facts. The district court did consider the Trog factors in determining that defendant was not amenable to probation and the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to apply the Trog factors when addressing the duration of defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that he was precluded from challenging his sentence duration because his plea agreement barred him from doing so. The appellate court ruled that there was a difference between having no sentence duration to challenge and having a reason not to do so, even a reason as strong as an agreement not to do so. Defendant's appeal waiver constituted only a reason not to challenge the sentence duration on direct review. Defendant received a significant benefit for the waiver, in the form of a dispositional departure. If the appellate court were to recognize the appeal waiver as justifiable grounds for applying the U.S. Supreme Court Blakely decision retroactively, other grounds would inevitably be advanced and the Blakely retroactivity analysis would evolve from a bright-line rule into a fairness argument dependent on the facts of each individual case. The appellate court declined to open the door to a wide variety of fact-specific exceptions to the bright-line rule distinguishing between direct review and collateral review.</SPAN></P>

The record contained significant discussion regarding defendant's stipulation to the aggravating factor of victim vulnerability and how that agreement impacted his sentencing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued, inter alia, that based on an officer's testimony that his reason for stopping the vehicle was an ongoing investigation of one defendant he had a lawful basis for the stop. The court of appeals disagreed. The State conceded that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the person driving the vehicle had committed any traffic violation or other criminal activity. The officer admitted that the vehicle had not been seen in the area for a month and that the stop took place in the afternoon, not in the early morning hours when defendant was believed to deliver drugs. The State nonetheless argued that the stop was valid under the totality of the circumstances. The State failed to cite anything indicating that a suspicion that stemmed from an ongoing investigation could constitute a particularized objective basis for an investigatory stop. Even if the ongoing investigation were part of a valid, particularized, and objective basis for the stop, that basis evaporated as soon as officers discovered that the person for whom they were looking was not in the vehicle. Because there was no particularized, objective basis for stopping the vehicle, the stop was illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant scuffled with a police officer who was attempting to question defendant near the scene of a sounding burglar alarm at a downtown business. Defendant argued that the district court abused its discretion by denying his request for a different public defender. The appellate court ruled that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request for substitute counsel or in any other manner with regard to defendant's representation. Defendant did not argue that exceptional circumstances existed nor had he challenged his attorney's ability or competence to represent him. Defendant never expressed an interest in representing himself and did not discharge his appointed attorney. Also, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of the charged offense. Defendant turned and tried to punch the officer, but the officer backed away from the punch and used a takedown technique to bring defendant to the ground. Defendant resisted and grabbed the officer's legs causing him to fall and scrape his hands and right knee. Defendant did not release the officer's legs until the officer maced him twice, and the altercation lasted 15-20 seconds.</SPAN></P>

He argued that his guilty plea was not accurate or intelligent, but the appellate court affirmed, stating that when appellant pled guilty, his competency was not an issue under Minn. R. Juv. P. 20.01, subd. 3. Appellant failed to provide any evidence of his incompetence at the time that he entered his initial plea of guilty. Through defense counsel's questioning, appellant admitted sufficient facts to support his guilty plea. Defense counsel inquired about the amount of time appellant had spent with the public defender discussing the charges, the plea options and meaning of the options, and the consequences of a guilty plea. Based on the totality of the circumstances under Minn. R. Juv. P. 8.04, subd. 1, appellant's guilty plea was voluntary and intelligent. He was not denied due process with the refusal to conduct a second competency hearing because he effectively waived his right to be present since he was in treatment and his public defender made a record of that absence and appellant's location during the hearing.</SPAN></P>

The Crow Wing County District Court found that the city's encroachment constituted a de facto taking and granted the city's motion to dismiss the landowners' claims. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city encroached on the landowners' property when it laid a gravel road in 1971 that deviated from the platted road. The appellate court determined that the district court erred in granting the city's motion to dismiss. Although the landowners' Torrens property was subject to taking by eminent domain under Minn. Stat. &sect; 508.02 (2006), the nature of the damages caused by the city's action more readily constituted a trespass than a de facto taking because the degree of interference by the gravel road at the wrong location was not so substantial as to constitute a taking in the constitutional sense under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Thus, the 15-year statute of limitations for recovery of real estate did not apply under Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.02 (2006). The landowners sufficiently stated a claim because (1) the city's failure to abide by the landowners' demand to remove the road supported the continuing trespass and ejectment claims, (2) the six-year statute of limitations for actions in trespass did not run from the initial trespass and therefore was inapplicable to the claims, and (3) even if the trespass claim was untimely, the landowners stated an ejectment claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed and remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with fourth-degree DWI, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 1(1) (2004). He moved to suppress the test results in the criminal proceedings, arguing that his due-process rights were violated when he was read the implied-consent advisory that the Supreme Court of Minnesota had declared unconstitutional in Fedziuk. The Anoka County District Court (Minnesota) denied the motion, found appellant guilty, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the court erred in not suppressing evidence obtained under an implied-consent statute that was declared partially unconstitutional for not providing prompt judicial review of a driver's-license revocation. In Fedziuk, the Supreme Court of Minnesota held that the 2003 amendments to the implied-consent statute were unconstitutional as violating due process because they removed the requirement for prompt judicial review of a prehearing revocation. The court severed the unconstitutional provision and revived the version of the implied-consent law existing prior to the 2003 amendments. Accordingly, the implied-consent statute remained in effect. Thus, although appellant was read the implied-consent advisory at a time when the process was governed by a statute that was later declared unconstitutional in part, the portion that was declared unconstitutional did not relate to anything to do with appellant's decision to submit to an Intoxilyzer test. Appellant voluntarily submitted to testing after he consulted with an attorney and the implied-consent advisory did not include misleading language that would have made appellant feel coerced into submitting to a test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in finding that he did not have standing to challenge the search of his mother's duplex, the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions, his Blakely waiver was inadequate, and the sentence imposed was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed as to all of defendant's points, finding first that the evidence that the trial court found credible supported the finding that defendant did not live with his mother and did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the basement. Thus, the trial court did not err in not suppressing the handgun. The evidence was sufficient to support the convictions based on the testimony of several witnesses who identified defendant and saw the shooting, photos of the coat defendant was wearing, the handgun found in the basement, and shell casings found at the scene that matched the gun. Defendant validly waived the jury determination and agreed that the trial court would determine the existence of aggravating factors. Some factors included that defendant put the public at risk, and treated the victim with particular cruelty in that the shooting was unprovoked and done at close range.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant general contractor appealed from the judgment of the Dakota County District Court (Minnesota), which granted summary judgment to respondents on the grounds that the district court erred in its determination that the contractor's settlement agreement with the homeowners was a Pierringer release, and that the contractor's claims were time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court did not err by finding that the first settlement agreement controlled. While the contractor had not yet signed it, the homeowners had signed it and received the settlement proceeds a few months before the summary-judgment hearing. Even if the district court was in error and the revised settlement agreement was the appropriate one to consider, the result was the same because both agreements were modified Pierringer releases. Because the agreements were modified Pierringer releases, the contractor had paid no more than its fair share of the common liability to the homeowners. Therefore, the contractor had no remaining third-party claims. The district court did not err in its ruling. Also, the district court did not err by determining that its claims for contribution and indemnity were time-barred by Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051 (2002) because the claims had not accrued and were not brought within 10 years of the completion of the home's construction. Finally, because the issue had been resolved by the Minnesota Supreme Court in another case, the court concluded that the contractor's due-process rights had not been violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, the Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, resentenced appellant to 240 months in prison for aggravated first-degree robbery, an upward durational departure from the presumptive guidelines sentence, after impaneling a second jury to determine whether he met the criteria for sentencing as a dangerous or career offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095 (2002). This appeal, which challenged the court's resentencing procedures, followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When resentencing defendant, the district court had inherent authority to impanel a second jury to consider whether aggravating factors existed under &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2, even though it lacked legislative authority to do so, and the use of a sentencing jury to consider aggravating factors at the resentencing hearing did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Because the complaint charging appellant with aggravated first-degree robbery informed him of the nature of the charges and the maximum sentence, failure to include aggravating factors in the complaint did not violate constitutional due-process or notice requirements. Retroactive application of the 2005 amendments to Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.10, subd. 5(a) (2004), and the former version of Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.D, authorized the district court to impanel a sentencing jury on resentencing of appellant's 2003 conviction and to use the jury's findings to impose a new sentence. The retroactive application of the 2005 amendments did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. and Minnesota constitutions. Appellant's sentence was not unreasonable in light of his criminal history.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he was a sexually dangerous person. The court of appeals disagreed. Although the patient participated in several sex-offender treatment programs he was terminated from each of the programs after violating probation, supervised-release provisions, or program rules. During periods of supervised release and even after the first petition for civil commitment was dismissed, the patient's actions were consistent with his cycle of sexual offending. He maintained contact with minors both in person and on the Internet, viewed pornography, used alcohol, and continually used computers and the Internet to facilitate his sexual behaviors. The district court's determination that the patient was likely to engage in further acts of harmful sexual conduct was supported by the opinions of two experts, and tests indicated that the patient was at a high risk for sexual reoffense. Therefore, clear and convincing evidence supported the district court's determination that the patient was highly likely to engage in future harmful sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Clay County District Court (Minnesota) convicted defendant of two counts of possession of pornographic work involving minors in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.247, subd. 4 (2004). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the trial court might not have identified the precise ages of the persons depicted in the pornographic videos, it did find that the videos depicted minors, which satisfied Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 617.247, subd. 4 and 617.246, subd. 1(b) (2004). Additionally, nothing in Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.247 required the State to present expert testimony or evidence of the identity of the person depicted. Therefore, the appellate court concluded that it was not necessary that the trial court's finding that the videos depicted minors be supported by expert testimony or evidence of the identities of the persons depicted. In addition, based on the videos, a reasonable fact-finder could have concluded that the persons depicted were, in fact, minors. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to show that the videos depicted minors. In addition, the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that defendant possessed the two videos with knowledge of their content as he described their content and stated that he watched one more than once. Finally, because there were multiple victims, the trial court did not err in sentencing defendant to concurrent sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee housing redevelopment authority (HRA) sought to take title and possession of appellant owner's commercial property pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 117.042 (2004), the &quot;quick-take&quot; statute. The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) found that the taking was for a public purpose, was reasonably necessary to that purpose, was not arbitrary or capricious, and granted the motion to acquire title pursuant to the statute. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner argued that the HRA exceeded its power to take private property, took private property that was not &quot;blighted&quot; for a nonpublic purpose, and took property that was not necessary. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota found that the HRA acted within its authority and the district court properly exercised its discretion. The district court found that the HRA plainly had statutory authority in the instant case based on Minn. Stat. &sect; 469.012, subd. 1g, since the HRA acted for a public purpose and in a public way. The statutory definition of blighted area included both the condition of a service station and retail mall as well as the layout issues confronting the city. It was irrelevant that the owner's property failed to meet the definition of blight because cities acted within their power by eliminating blight on an area basis rather than a structure-by-structure basis. Therefore, the HRA did not exceed its authority in condemning the owner's property. Nor was the HRA's condemnation of the property for an unconstitutional private purpose because transferring it to another private entity for redevelopment did not constitute a private purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator trucking firms filed a petition challenging respondent Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry's (DOLI) decision upholding the certification of truck rental rates, operating costs, and broker fees under the Minnesota Prevailing Wage Law, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 177.41-.44 (2004). The DOLI Commissioner (Commissioner) adopted an administrative law judge's recommendation to deny the petition. The trucking firms appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOLI conducted a survey of over 10,000 firms and individuals, received 139 responses, and certified the truck rental rates, operating costs, and broker fees. The court rejected the trucking firms' challenges to the DOLI's order. The Commissioner's decision to conduct a survey to determine operating costs was a reasonable interpretation of Minn. R. 5200.1105 (2005) because the rule was silent on how operating costs were to be gathered and the Commissioner had historically used surveys to determine operating costs. The Commissioner's interpretation that the definition of &quot;trucking firms&quot; under Minn. R. 5200.1106, subpt. 7B (2005) included prime contractors was reasonable. The Commissioner did not err in refusing to disclose the names of the survey respondents because Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 175.24-.27 (2004) clearly prohibited the DOLI from releasing such information. The Commissioner did not unconstitutionally impair existing contracts under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, because the certified rates were not retroactive, and the trucking firms could have negotiated terms in their contracts to resolve any conflict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a committed individual (appellant), sought review of the decision of the Anoka County District Court (Minnesota), which ordered indeterminate civil commitment after it determined that appellant was a sexually dangerous person (SDP) under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c(a) (2004) and that he had a sexual psychopathic personality (SPP) as defined by &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the district court's order for indeterminate civil commitment, appellant claimed that the district court erred in determining that he was a SPP and a SDP. He was also denied intensive supervised release as a less-restrictive alternative. The appellate court affirmed, stating that appellant's pattern of behavior demonstrated an inability to control sexual urges. The district court's findings were well supported by the record, and the record justified the determination that appellant should be indeterminately committed as an SDP. Appellant needed to address the psychological issues that contributed to his history of sexually deviant behavior and he needed to understand his sex offense cycle, to learn relapse strategies, and to avoid getting into situations that could lead to re-offense. Multiple experts concluded that appellant's behavior demonstrated a habitual course of misconduct, and appellant had threatened to kill a victim and the victim's parents if the victim told anyone about being photographed naked. Additionally, appellant failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a less-restrictive alternative under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.185, subd. 1 (2004).</SPAN></P>
