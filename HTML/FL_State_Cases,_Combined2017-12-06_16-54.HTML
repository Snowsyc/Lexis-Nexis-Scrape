</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court in and for Seminole County (Florida) to first-degree murder.

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered the victim after a several-days-long crack cocaine binge. After escaping from police, he climbed to the roof of a house and observed the victim leaving for work. He decided to kill her when she returned. He entered her house, ate her food, did laundry, and collected items to steal from her. When she returned home, he tied her up and killed her by strangling her, stabbing her, and striking her in the head with a blunt object as she lay facedown on her bathroom floor. He then left in her car with the stolen items, pawning them to obtain more crack. The court found that the trial court complied with the three-part procedure outlined in Koon v. Dugger for considering mitigation evidence, although defendant waived the presentation of mitigation evidence. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court failed to consider mental mitigation because the presentence investigation report did not alert the trial court to the probability of significant mental mitigation. The findings that the murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated (CCP) and especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel (HAC), &sect; 921.141(5)(i), Fla. Stat., were amply supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, a prisoner under sentence of death, appealed the denial of his amended successive motion for postconviction relief. The supreme court affirmed, stating that he failed to satisfy the heavy burden that Florida's current lethal injection procedures were constitutionally defective in violation of U.S. Const. ament. VIII. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to strike the State's witnesses because the State's witnesses did not become irrelevant after the exclusion of the two reporters' affidavits; instead, their testimony served to rebut a doctor's account of the execution. The inmate's contention that because he was a Cuban national, that the State's failure to advise him of the right to notify his consulate of his arrest and to consult with that consulate or a diplomatic officer without delay under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations entitled him to relief was both barred and without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner citizen brought a petition against respondent governor, seeking a writ of quo warranto directing the governor to demonstrate that he had not exceeded his authority, in part, by suspending agency rulemaking through Executive Order 11-01 and Executive Order 11-72.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executive orders suspended and terminated rulemaking by precluding notice publication and other compliance with ch. 120, Fla. Stat. absent prior approval from the Office of Fiscal Accountability and Regulatory Reform (OFARR). The court found that to this extent, the executive orders, contrary to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), infringed upon the process of rulemaking and encroached upon the legislature's delegation of its rulemaking power, and that the governor exceeded his constitutional authority. Separation of powers was recognized by Art. II, &sect; 3, Fla. Const. Pursuant to &sect;&sect; 120.52, 120.536(1), Fla. Stat. (2010), rulemaking was a derivative of lawmaking and was a legislative function. Pursuant to the APA, under &sect; 120.54(3)(a)(1), Fla. Stat. (2010), agencies were required to provide notice prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of any rule (other than an emergency rule). Executive Order 11-72 mandated that agencies receive OFARR approval before taking any of the three rulemaking actions. The executive orders supplanted legislative delegations by redefining the terms of those delegations through binding directives to state agencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee claimants sued appellant companies for damages due to asbestos exposure. The trial court dismissed the suits for failing to meet the requirements of the Florida Asbestos and Silica Compensation Fairness Act (Act), tit. 45, ch. 774, pt. II, Fla. Stat. (2007). The Court of Appeal of Florida, Fourth District, found the Act unconstitutional as applied to the claimants, reversed, and certified a conflict. The companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether retroactive application of the Act to the claimants was permissible. The appellate court found that it was not. The claimants possessed a vested property interest in their right to pursue an action based on asbestos-related injuries. Prior to the Act, the development of particular impairment symptoms as described in the Act was never the legal factor in determining &quot;manifestation&quot; or accrual under Florida law. If there was proof of injury, there was no requirement of any particular level of impairment to bring a suit. Medical and X-ray reports confirmed that the claimants suffered from actual lung injuries that were consistent with asbestos-related disease. The claimants thus had an accrued cause of action, which constituted a property interest under Art. I, &sect; 2, Fla. Const. Application of the Act to the claimants would have destroyed their vested rights in accrued causes of action for asbestos-related injury. The Act could not have been constitutionally applied to the claimants. The appellate court disapproved the decision of the Court of Appeal of Florida, Third District in DaimlerChrysler Corporation v. Hurst, 949 So. 2d 279 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2007).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The holding of the intermediate appellate court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was subject to a death sentence for three murders at a restaurant 15 years earlier. Defendant argued that a 2008 letter issued by the FBI was newly discovered evidence. The letter stated that the comparative bullet lead analysis (CBLA) conducted by the FBI on bullets used in the crime was flawed and that the science did not support the testimony of the State's witness. The court agreed that the letter was newly discovered evidence, although it was not in existence at the time of the inmate's trial but held that it would not have resulted in an acquittal given DNA and other evidence linking the inmate to the murders. The court rejected the inmate's claim that because the FBI had knowledge of the flaws in CBLA at the time of trial, the State's knowing presentation of the FBI agent's false testimony violated Giglio, because the State was unaware at that time of the flaws in CBLA. Similarly, the State's failure to disclose that the agent's testimony was unscientific and unsound did not violate Brady because the State was unaware of these facts. Also, defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the CBLA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the postconviction court's denial of relief and denied defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

The inmate argued that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel in both the guilt and penalty phases. The appellate court found that, while counsel's closing argument as to who fired the gun differed from that made during his opening statement, there was evidence supporting the defense theory that someone other than the inmate, either of his accomplices, committed the murder. The jury convicted the inmate of first-degree felony murder, and thus, the identity of the shooter in this case was not material. The inmate failed to show that the rationale in which counsel believed he decided not to call one of the accomplices was not supported by competent, substantial evidence or that counsel's strategy was unreasonable. Moreover, the inmate failed to demonstrate that the accomplice was an available witness at the time of trial. The inmate failed to demonstrate prejudice based upon counsel's failure to recognize different times that residue swabbings were done because, as the jury convicted the inmate of felony murder, the identity of the perpetrator who fired the gun was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a bench trial, a security guard testified that she told petitioner that he would have to leave the school grounds. The next day, the witness again observed petitioner on school grounds. She notified the school's police officer, who arrested petitioner for trespassing. The appellate court held, however, that to prove that a defendant committed the first-degree misdemeanor set out in &sect; 810.097(2), the State had to present evidence that the defendant was (1) warned to leave the premises by a specific person, and (2) that that person was either the principal of the school or one who had received authorization from the principal to restrict access to the property. The State presented no evidence that the school's security guard was a designee of the school's principal for the purposes of the trespass statute, or that the guard was in any way vested with authority to restrict access to the school's property. Further, the State cited no rule or statute indicating that a school security guard, by virtue of his or her title, would possess such authority as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court in and for Clay County (Florida) of four counts of first-degree murder.

The trial court sentenced defendant to death on each count, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant, a drug dealer, shot the victims because he believed they had contributed to his prior arrest for drug dealing. Defendant refused to cooperate with doctors appointed to evaluate his competency to stand trial. The trial court properly ruled from its own observations of defendant and from the opinion of one expert that defendant was competent. The other two experts could not rule out that defendant was malingering. The trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant to represent himself because some of his requests for self-representation were equivocal, and when he was allowed to represent himself, he had to be removed from the courtroom for disruptive and obstreperous behavior. The State proved beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of two weighty statutory aggravating circumstances: that defendant was previously convicted of a capital felony, and that the crimes were committed in a cold and calculated and premeditated manner. Defendant presented no mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences of death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant forced his way into the victim's home, shot the victim in the head, then held the family at gunpoint for several hours.

The court held that defendant's confession, which he offered in exchange for getting to see his girlfriend, was not the product of improper coercion. This was not a quid pro quo offer not to prosecute, defendant was not threatened, and defendant himself proposed the deal. The court upheld the trial court's finding of aggravating factors that the murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated and that it was heinous, atrocious, and cruel under &sect; 921.141(5), Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent insured sued petitioner Florida Insurance Guaranty Association (FIGA), seeking payment on a property damage claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate appellate court ruled that &sect; 627.7015, Fla. Stat., as amended in 2005, applied retroactively to the 2004 commercial residential insurance policy issued by the original insurer and that the FIGA was bound by original insurer's failure to give the notice required in the amended statute. The appellate court agreed with the FIGA that a two-prong test for retroactivity analysis was proper and that the intermediate appellate court misapplied precedent in analyzing the question of retroactivity based solely on the second prong of the test. The intermediate appellate court did not inquire into whether there existed clear legislative intent for retroactive application of the 2005 amendments to &sect; 627.7015. The enacting law specifically stated that the amendments were to be effective July 1, 2005, and there was no &quot;clearly expressed legislative intent&quot; to apply the amendments retroactively. Thus, the 2005 amendments did not apply retroactively to the 2004 insurance policy to bar FIGA's right to enforce the appraisal provision in that contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the intermediate appellate court was quashed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate appealed the denial of his motion to vacate his conviction of first-degree murder and sentence of death filed under Fla.

At trial, counsel presented the testimony of family members as lay witnesses to establish the violent childhood experienced by the inmate and expert testimony to explain the effect of that environment on him. The fact that some of the testimony proved to be unfavorable to the inmate did not undermine the supreme court's confidence in the verdict; the inmate's own expert testified to many of the same prejudicial facts. The denial of habeas corpus petition was proper, in part because a jury instruction on the &quot;avoid arrest&quot; aggravator was properly given and appellate counsel could not be held ineffective for failing to raise a nonmeritorious issue.</SPAN></P>

Although defendant claimed that the evidence relating to his sexual relationship with the victim's daughter was overly prejudicial and required a new trial, the supreme court disagreed, stating that the collateral crime evidence that defendant was engaged in an illegal sexual relationship with the daughter was relevant to establish motive and inextricably intertwined with the testimony of the chain of events. Additionally, the trial court did not err in finding under &sect; 921.141(5)(i), Fla. Stat. (2009) that the murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate appealed the order denying his amended motion for postconviction relief. Through his postconviction motion, the inmate challenged his conviction of first-degree murder and sentence of death. He also petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. The supreme court affirmed and denied habeas relief, stating that the inmate failed to show that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel testified that there was no basis to set aside the plea and counsel had an ethical obligation not to file a frivolous motion. Further, to the extent that the inmate was really raising a residual or lingering doubt claim, Florida did not recognize residual doubt, much less residual doubt as to the aggravators. Counsel could not be ineffective for failing to pursue a meritless claim. Because the exclusionary rule was not a remedy for a violation of &sect; 394.453, Fla. Stat. (1995) unless a constitutional violation had also occurred, even if trial counsel had raised that argument in the inmate's motion to suppress, the motion still would have been denied and its denial affirmed on appeal on that basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found competent, substantial evidence to support defendant's conviction of first-degree murder of his estranged wife, under theories of premeditated or felony murder, as defendant entered her apartment without permission intending to kill her, and once inside he dragged his stepdaughter by the hair into her bedroom and bound her to keep her from escaping or warning the victim. He then waited for approximately one hour for the victim to return home and stabbed the victim repeatedly without provocation. The stepdaughter testified to observing defendant strike the victim with one of the knives he had brought. Defendant claimed that jurors were not willing to accept his mitigation based on his upbringing and societal differences in Vietnam, but the juror comments in question did not rise to the level of ethnic bias. The statements made were not open appeals to the bias in others. The victim was conscious during at least part of her attack and was stabbed at least six times. The attack was unprovoked and witnessed by her daughter.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding testimony under &sect; 90.405(1), Fla. Stat. because the testimony concerning an individual who had provided an alibi appeared to have been based on mere personal opinion, fleeting encounters, or rumor, which was insufficient to satisfy &sect; 90.405(1)'s admissibility predicate. The evidence was sufficient because defendant's bloody fingerprints were found at the scene, and the police found DNA under the fingernails of one of the victims that was consistent with defendant's DNA. Further, police found blood in defendant's truck that was genetically consistent with that of one of the victims. There was also eyewitness descriptions of two men in an altercation outside the warehouse where the bodies were found that were consistent with the physical appearances of defendant and one of the victims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In combined cases, petitioner department suspended the driver's licenses of respondent licensees based on refusals to take breath tests, and the licensees sought review. The Court of Appeal of Florida, First District, found that a suspension was proper only if the refusal was incident to a lawful arrest. However, the Court of Appeal of Florida, Second District, reached an opposite conclusion and upheld the suspension. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first rephrased certified question asked if the department was allowed to suspend a license under &sect; 322.2615, Fla. Stat. for refusal to submit to a breath test if the refusal was not incident to a lawful arrest. The second certified question asked if the issue of whether the refusal was incident to a lawful arrest was within the allowable scope of review of a department hearing officer in a proceeding to determine if sufficient cause existed to sustain a suspension under &sect; 322.2615 for refusal to submit. The appellate court found that &sect; 322.2615 authorized the department to suspend the driver's license of a person who refused to submit to a &quot;lawful&quot; breath test. The only definition of a lawful breath test under &sect; 322.2615 was found in &sect; 316.1932(1)(a), Fla. Stat. The statutes were read in pari materia. A &quot;lawful test&quot; under &sect; 322.2615 was one that was requested incident to a lawful arrest, as specified in &sect; 316.1932. Further, the only reading that avoided an unreasonable and unconstitutional result was to construe &sect;&sect; 322.2615, 316.1932, in pari materia and allow the hearing officer to review whether a breath test was administered incident to a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court answered the first rephrased certified question in the negative and the second question in the affirmative.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate appealed an order denying his motion to vacate his convictions of first-degree murder and sentences of death and petitioned the supreme court for a writ of habeas corpus. The supreme court reversed the denial of postconviction relief as it pertained to the inmate's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase because counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the penalty phase when counsel failed to investigate, develop, and present available mitigating evidence that would have legally precluded an override of the jury's life recommendation. Therefore, his death sentences were vacated and the supreme court remanded for the imposition of life instead. The inmate's petition for habeas corpus was denied. The inmate's trial counsel failed to conduct any investigation into possible mitigation. A reasonable investigation would have revealed substantial mitigation. Further, the record did not reflect that, at any time, the inmate actively concealed mitigating factors or that he instructed counsel not to pursue an investigation of mitigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, after his motion to suppress was denied, entered a plea of no contest in the trial court to possession of the listed chemical pseudoephedrine with intent to use it to manufacture methamphetamine, in violation of &sect; 893.149(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2006). Defendant reserved the right to appeal the denial of the suppression motion. The trial court imposed a sentence. The First District of Appeals of Florida affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented was whether probable cause existed for the warrantless search of defendant's vehicle, following a traffic stop, based on a drug-detection dog's alert to the vehicle. On appeal, the court found that the State of Florida failed to present sufficient evidence to meet its burden to establish probable cause to have conducted the warrantless search of defendant's truck. The State did not meet its burden in demonstrating that a police officer had a reasonable basis for believing that the dog was reliable at the time of the search and, thus, that the dog's alert, the lynch-pin of the probable cause analysis in the case, indicated a fair probability that drugs were to be found in defendant's vehicle. In the absence of a reliable alert, the other factors considered in the totality of circumstances analysis -- defendant's expired car license tag; defendant's shaking, breathing rapidly, and inability to sit still; and defendant's open beer can -- did not rise to the level of probable cause that there were illegal drugs inside the vehicle. Accordingly, the search of defendant's vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the motion to suppress was reversed. The case was remanded for proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant, the Florida Bar, brought a disciplinary action against respondent attorney. A referee recommended that the attorney was to be found guilty of violating R. Regulating Fla. Bar 4-1.7, 4-1.5, and 4-8.4. The referee recommended that the attorney was to receive a public reprimand. The Florida Bar petitioned for review of the recommended sanction. The attorney filed a cross-petition for review of the recommendations of guilt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disciplinary case arose from an underlying civil case seeking class certification for alleged improper assessment fees imposed by a city on property owners. The attorney represented clients in the class action. The referee found that the attorney took an excessive fee when he settled with individual plaintiffs to the detriment of the putative class. The referee concluded that the attorney breached a fiduciary duty owed to the putative class and prejudiced that class when he settled on behalf of individual plaintiffs to the detriment of the putative class. The state supreme court found that the attorney's actions regarding the disproportionate settlement amount, as well as the terms of the settlement, created a conflict of interest that prejudiced the remaining class members. Further, the attorney abandoned the putative class via his settlement negotiations, hid the terms of the settlement agreement from the class through a nondisclosure agreement, and stopped litigating on behalf of the class as a result of the standstill agreement. The attorney's actions violated the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar which the referee cited. However, a more substantial sanction was warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The referee's findings of fact, recommendations of guilt, and award of costs were approved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court in and for Seminole County (Florida), which convicted him of the first-degree murder of his estranged wife and the attempted first-degree murder of her mother.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and death sentence for the first-degree murder of his estranged wife, but the supreme court affirmed, stating that the State presented evidence that he confessed to the officer transporting him to jail that he shot his wife because she spent all of their money and then started dating her ex-husband. That constituted direct evidence of defendant's guilt. Moreover, several witnesses testified that defendant was firing a shotgun near the carport of the home of the victim's mother on the night in question, resulting in the victim's death. Evidence also established that shells collected at the crime scene were fired from the shotgun found in defendant's motel room. The cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravating factor was properly applied because, although defendant and the victim had recently separated, the record lacked evidence showing the type of an ongoing, highly emotional dispute needed to refute a finding of cool and calm reflection. Further, when compared with other capital cases, the death sentence was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as a basis for relief. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the issue of juror misconduct after it was discovered that the jury foreperson had been charged with and pled nolo contendere to a charge of civil contempt because there was nothing about the nonviolent offense that suggested that the juror would be biased against a defendant pleading not guilty in a death penalty case. Further, defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to suppress defendant's statement to the police because counsel's decision was a reasonable and strategic choice in that, short of calling defendant to testify, there was no available evidence aside from that statement that could explain defendant's possession and use of the victim's ATM card. Further, counsel could not be deemed ineffective because any motion to suppress would have been meritless. The record established that defendant's initial statement was voluntary; as such, no Miranda warnings were required until defendant was formally arrested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences of death, but the supreme court affirmed, stating that the evidence was sufficient. The State introduced circumstantial evidence of an elaborate plan to establish an alibi, a plan that defendant had developed and begun to implement ahead of time. The State also introduced circumstantial evidence placing defendant at the murder scene at the time of the murders. The supreme court did not determine whether the admission of defendant's statements to an agent were erroneous because any possible error here was harmless. Defendant's claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over him because he was illegally deported from Ecuador was also without merit. Although it was circumstantial, competent substantial evidence supported that the murder of a victim was committed to avoid arrest. That victim was personally known to defendant and he speculated that the victim was not the target of the crime, but rather a witness who had to be eliminated. The supreme court had also found that the death penalty was proportionate in cases where the totality of the circumstances was similar to the totality of the current circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of the order of the Circuit Court in and for Orange County (Florida), which, in ruling on the inmate's petition for postconviction relief from a capital conviction, concluded that the inmate was not mentally retarded pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.203 and 3.851.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that the circuit court erred in determining that he was not mentally retarded in accordance with the definition set forth in Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.203 and &sect; 921.137(1), Fla. Stat. (2005). The court concluded that the circuit court incorrectly applied the standard error of measurement to the IQ score reached by one of the three experts in the case. There was some reasonable possibility that the error affected the circuit court's determination of the inmate's intellectual functioning. However, the inmate could not establish all three prongs of the applicable test to be excluded from the death penalty based on mental retardation as he failed to establish that he demonstrated deficient adaptive functioning. The inmate's handling of the leasing of his apartment, his administration of household chores, his daily maintenance of personal hygiene, his work to secure a GED diploma, and his serving as an aide in an engine repair class in addition to organizing and developing lesson plans for a motorcycle repair shop showed that he had the ability to live independently in society. Finally, the circuit court did not commit prejudicial error in its admission of evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of, inter alia, aggravated battery with great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement, and was sentenced. Following an earlier appeal and remand, defendant was resentenced. The Court of Appeal of Florida, First District, reversed the sentence, holding that, among other things, the trial court's finding of upward departure grounds on resentencing violated Apprendi and Blakely. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether, in cases in which the convictions were final before Apprendi issued, Apprendi and Blakely applied to resentencings held after Apprendi issued where the resentencing was not final when Blakely issued. The intermediate appellate court held that Apprendi and Blakely applied in such cases. The appellate court agreed. Where a sentence was reversed or vacated, the resentencings were de novo in nature, and the full panoply of due process considerations attached. Applying Apprendi and Blakely to such a resentencing did not constitute retroactive application. Here, defendant's his pre-Apprendi sentence was vacated because it was illegal. As a result, defendant was resentenced in a de novo proceeding, and Apprendi and Blakely were applicable. Galindez v. State, 910 So. 2d 284 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2005), Cutts v.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate initially argued that the trial court's interpretation of mental retardation, mandating a cut-off IQ score of 70 or below to meet the first prong of the test for mental retardation in capital sentencing, was contrary to case law and the Eighth Amendment. The appellate court found that there was competent, substantial evidence that the inmate was not mentally retarded. The language of &sect; 921.137(1), Fla. Stat. was clear and unambiguous in mandating a strict cut-off IQ score of two standard deviations from the mean score, which was exactly 70. The inmate also alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to comments made by the prosecutor in both the guilt and the penalty phase. These claims were without merit. The inmate's motion failed to establish how these alleged instances of ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced him. In addition, the majority of the prosecutorial argument alleged to be improper was fair comment on the evidence or inferences arising from the evidence, or was proper response to argument of defense counsel. Counsel's decision not to present the testimony of a specific psychologist might have been sound trial strategy.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, counsel was not deficient on this basis. The inmate's claim that there was a substantial likelihood that a juror knew the victim's father was refuted by the record. Any suggestion that the juror concealed information or that the juror was biased was unsupported by the record. Although the inmate claimed that competent counsel would have linked his age with some other characteristic or the crime such as immaturity, evidence bearing on the inmate's emotional maturity was presented, and counsel's performance was not deficient. The inmate's claim that an evidentiary hearing was required to determine whether a reasonably feasible alternative to Florida's current lethal injection protocol existed was rejected.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court in and for Broward County (Florida), which denied his postconviction motion to vacate his convictions for first-degree murder and sentences of death filed under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate appealed the order denying his postconviction motion to vacate his convictions of first-degree murder and sentences of death. He also petitioned the supreme court for a writ of habeas corpus. The supreme court affirmed the denial of postconviction relief and denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The inmate contended that the circuit court improperly excluded five witnesses whose testimony he wished to present during his evidentiary hearing and that the court improperly granted the State's motion for discovery pertaining to the proposed witnesses. However, a trial court was required to permit prehearing discovery during postconviction proceedings under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. Further, the circuit court reasonably allowed the inmate the possibility of introducing the witnesses' testimony later if he demonstrated relevance. He also failed to prove that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel. The inmate's Brady claim was without merit because the evidence did not establish that any of the reports not provided to the defense contained favorable evidence or that they did not contain information that the defense already had.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was also indicted on five other counts of first degree murder.

The court found that the collateral crime evidence established that defendant committed substantially similar crimes on two other occasions, which was relevant to identity and premeditation. Defendant's actions and the circumstances surrounding the incident were clearly inconsistent with his contention that the takings were merely an afterthought. Moreover, the jury received an &quot;independent act&quot; or &quot;afterthought&quot; instruction, but rejected the theory, finding that defendant killed the victim during the course of a robbery. The trial court's finding of the pecuniary gain aggravator was supported by competent, substantial evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged the trial court's finding that the evidence established that he did not experience concurrent deficits in adaptive behavior for purposes of &sect; 921.137, Fla. Stat. and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.203. The appellate court found that the trial court's findings on this issue were supported by competent, substantial evidence. Among other things, several witnesses testified about defendant's daily living and other capabilities, experts opined about defendant's adaptive functioning, and the trial court made lengthy findings based on the evidence presented. Defendant functioned well at home and was capable of traveling independently to and from work and appointments with his parole officer and from Ohio to Alabama and Florida. The planning of the murder and the cover-up also supported the trial court's findings. The collateral crime evidence showing that defendant committed a separate murder did not become a feature of the trial and was not improper. The evidence was sufficient to find defendant guilty of first-degree murder both on the theory of premeditated murder and on the theory of felony murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent representative of a decedent's estate sued appellants doctor and medical center, alleging wrongful death. The complaint sought, inter alia, relief for a child alleged to be the decedent's biological son. The trial court entered summary judgment for the doctor and the medical center on the child's claims. The Court of Appeal of Florida, Fourth District reversed and certified a conflict. The doctor and the medical center appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's mother was married to someone other than the decedent when the child was conceived and born, the mother's husband's paternal rights had not been divested, and the husband was not a party to this suit. The doctor and the medical center argued that the reference to &quot;father&quot; in &sect; 768.18(1), Fla. Stat. (2005) meant the legal father, defined as the husband of the woman who gave birth, if the woman was in fact married at the time. However, the appellate court found that &sect; 768.18(1) did not require a legal determination of paternity, but merely required recognition by the biological father of a responsibility of support. A formal adjudication of a legal relationship between the child and the decedent under ch. 742, Fla. Stat. was not a prerequisite for the child to bring a claim under ch. 768, Fla. Stat. If it was proven that the child was the decedent's biological child for whom the decedent recognized a responsibility for support, the child's survivor's claim vested at the decedent's death, without the need for a formal adjudication of a legal relationship being made before his death. Achumba v. Neustein, 793 So. 2d 1013 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2001) was disapproved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the intermediate appellate court was affirmed. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Polk County (Florida) denying his amended motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 38.50, challenging his capital murder conviction and sentence of death, pursuant to &sect; 921.141, Fla. Stat. (1995). Defendant also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, on his motion for postconviction relief, defendant failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel due to counsel's failure to adequately investigate and prepare the defense. Defendant failed under the second prong of Strickland to allege how he was prejudiced by counsel's alleged failures. Second, trial counsel made a reasonable strategic decision not to request individual voir dire with regard to issues of race and homosexuality. Third, no Brady violation occurred. Fourth, competent, substantial evidence clearly supported the postconviction court's finding that defendant was not mentally retarded. Although defendant scored 67 on one IQ test, evidence revealed that the score was unreliable. Three scores of 74, 75, and 76 appeared to be the scores most representative as to whether defendant possessed subaverage general intellectual functioning. Fifth, Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.203, which specified the procedure for raising mental retardation as a bar to a death sentence, was constitutional. Finally, defendant failed to meet his burden on any of his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in his habeas petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the motion for postconviction relief. It denied relief on defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Competent, substantial evidence existed to support each of defendant's convictions where he participated in the armed robber of two victims, shot one victim in the chest, and then approximately fifteen to thirty minutes later returned to the home and shot both victims in the backs of their heads. Further, defendant fled to elude police and led them on a high-speed vehicular chase. Defendant was 18 years old at the time of the murder. Evidence that defendant had a drug-based relationship with the victim's daughter was not similar fact evidence and, thus, was not irrelevant Williams rule evidence subject to the requirements of &sect; 90.404, Fla. Stat. (2006), but rather was relevant pursuant to &sect; 90.402, Fla. Stat. (2006), to establish the context in which the charged criminal acts occurred. Next, the trial court did not err in the penalty phase in admitting victim impact evidence or in finding the following aggravators: avoid arrest; cold, calculated, and premeditated; and heinous, atrocious, or cruel. Further, &sect; 921.141, Fla. Stat. did not violate Ring or related cases. Lastly, the death sentence was proportionate and not in violation of Art. I, &sect; 17, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees brought an action against appellant State, challenging statutes directing portions of civil filing fees to the general revenue fund.

The Court of Appeal of Florida, First District, certified that the judgment was of great public importance. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the statutes imposed an unconstitutional tax because filing fees were sent to the general revenue fund to be spent on unrelated government activities, and denied access to courts. The State asserted that the statutes were facially constitutional because the legislature appropriated more to the costs of the administration of justice than the amount of civil filing fees deposited into the general revenue fund. The appellate court held that there was no requirement in the Florida Constitution that the very money paid for filing fees be used to fund the administration of justice. Thus, the statutes, on their face, were not an unconstitutional tax. Further, because the legislature appropriated more to support the administration of justice than the amount of civil fees deposited into the general fund, the statutes were applied in a constitutional manner and were not operating as an unconstitutional tax. The filing fee statutes at issue were not contrary to Art. V, &sect; 14, Fla. Const. There was not competent substantial evidence to support the trial court's determination that Florida courts were inadequately funded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate appealed an order of the circuit court denying his motion to vacate his conviction of first-degree murder and sentence of death filed under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851. He also petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. The supreme court affirmed and denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. It was impossible for an assistant public defender to have been representing the inmate at the time that he made the statements at issue in Alabama. Because the public defender was not yet representing the inmate as defined by Florida Law, the public defender was not yet responsible for advising the inmate. Based on the factual circumstances of the crimes that the inmate clearly recollected, the aggravation and mitigation found by the sentencing court, and precedent, the additional evidence of the inmate's substance abuse and paranoia presented at the postconviction evidentiary hearing did not undermine confidence in his sentence. He failed to prove the ineffective assistance of counsel, in part because a lieutenant's testimony would not have been favorable. Thus, the inmate could not possibly have been prejudiced by the public defender's failure to secure that testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court in and for Orange County (Florida), which convicted him of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for first-degree murder and his resulting death sentence, but the supreme court affirmed, stating that there was substantial evidence to have inferred premeditation by defendant. Three witnesses testified that defendant spoke of killing the victim or her baby several months before the actual killing took place, and on the night of the crime, while the victim waited in his car, defendant stopped at a convenience store and purchased duct tape, a gas can, and gasoline, which were the tools that he eventually used to kill her. Testimony by the victim's father was proper under &sect; 90.401, Fla. Stat. and &sect; 90.402, Fla. Stat. (2009). His testimony that the victim was not allowed to date was relevant to the fact that she snuck out of her bedroom window to meet defendant and the father's testimony that he searched for the victim for six days was helpful in providing the jury with a context of the timeline involved in the investigation surrounding her disappearance. Further, the death sentence was appropriate because it was proportionate and because the murder was heinous, atrocious or cruel and was committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner.</SPAN></P>

The judge followed the recommendation of the jury and imposed a sentence of death for each murder. The supreme court found that the trial court erred in its rejection of the following proposed nonstatutory mitigating circumstances: (1) brain damage; (2) adjustment to life in prison; (3) low IQ; (4) acceptance of responsibility; (5) remorse; and (6) pedophilia. However, such error was harmless because the single aggravator of the murders being especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel overwhelmed the mitigators. Defendant's sentences were proportionate. The autopsy photographs were used by the medical examiner to explain his conclusions regarding the circumstances of the victims' deaths. The court was not required under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.710(b) to order a presentence investigation report. There was no violation of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3180(a) because the conversation between the judge and the defense attorney was not a critical stage of the proceedings requiring the defendant's presence for the purposes of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of first-degree murder. After an earlier appeal and remand, and a new penalty phase hearing, the jury unanimously recommended death. The Circuit Court in and for Bay County (Florida) sentenced the inmate to death. Later, the trial court denied the inmate's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 postconviction motion. The inmate appealed. The inmate also filed a habeas corpus petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in denying his claim that the State violated Brady when it failed to disclose various reports and information. The appellate court agreed with the trial court's finding that the inmate failed to establish that certain items were not produced, including list of jewelry missing from the victim's home, a laboratory report, and a photo of a photo of a shoe print. The trial court properly denied the inmate's Brady claim relating to a statement made by a jeweler because the jeweler was listed as a witness for the defense, and thus the inmate knew of the jeweler's statement. The inmate also knew of another witness interviewed by an investigator, and so there was no Brady violation as to this exhibit. As to any criminal charges against a pawnbroker, the inmate failed to establish that there were any deals between the State and the pawnbroker, and further, even if this evidence should have been disclosed, there was no prejudice because the pawnbroker's testimony did not contradict the inmate's theory of the case. The inmate also failed to establish his Giglio claims and his habeas corpus claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the inmate's postconviction motions was affirmed. The petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Secretary of State appealed an order by the Second Judicial Circuit Court (Florida) that determined a ballot summary for a proposed constitutional amendment was misleading and should be removed from the ballot of the general election; the secretary of state asked that the text of the proposed amendment be substituted for the misleading ballot summary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court found, and the secretary of state agreed, that the introduction of the ballot summary was misleading in that it mentioned waiting lists for doctors and doctor-patient confidentiality, while the amendment itself said nothing about them. In addition, neither the summary nor the amendment explained what mandates were at issue, why they did not work, or for whom the mandates did not work. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that the ballot summary did not comply with the requirements for accuracy in &sect; 101.161(1), Fla. Stat. (2009) and Art. XI, &sect; 5, Fla. Const. Because the Legislature did not resolve to place the entire text of the proposed amendment on the ballot, the remedy of substitution was not available. Accordingly, the only remedy was to strike the proposal from the ballot, thereby removing it from a vote of the electorate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his counsel was ineffective by failing to move to exclude from the penalty phase certain statements made at a hearing and a plea colloquy. The court held that the statements made at the hearing were admissible as party admissions under &sect; 90.803(18), Fla. Stat., and the statements were not made in connection with an offer to plead guilty. The statements made at the plea colloquy were made in open court, before a judge, after defense counsel advised defendant on the record to maintain his silence. Because Miranda warnings were only necessary prior to a custodial police interrogation, the absence of such warnings could not provide defense counsel with grounds for an objection. In his petition for writ of habeas corpus, defendant asserted that his sentence of death was unconstitutional due to evolving standards of decency. The court noted that the claims were procedurally barred as they could have been raised in his motion filed under Rule 3.851. Defendant made no assertion that he suffered from mental retardation, rather he only claimed diagnoses of Asperger's Syndrome, ADHD and frontal lobe damage, and mental illness did not serve as a bar to execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was under a sentence of death. The inmate challenged the constitutionality of lethal injection as administered in Florida and the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 945.10 and 27.702, Fla. Stat. (2007). The inmate also requested the court to recede from those portions of its prior decisions that held that capital collateral regional counsel (CCRC) attorneys could not assist capital defendants in challenging the state's intended method of execution under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The supreme court found that it had repeatedly rejected Eighth Amendment challenges to the state's 2007 lethal-injection protocol. The challenge to &sect; 945.10, Fla. Stat., failed because he failed to assert it in a prior postconviction proceeding and regardless, the governor had not signed a death warrant for the inmate and the department of corrections could not state with certainty who the inmate's eventual executioners would be. However, chapter 27 of the Florida Statutes permitted CCRC attorneys to represent death-sentenced individuals in &sect; 1983 injunctive relief actions. Section 27.702, Fla. Stat., permitted CCRC attorneys to represent capital defendants in claims under &sect; 1983 method-of-execution challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the inmate relief only to the extent that chapter 27 permitted CCRC attorneys to represent capital defendants in claims under &sect; 1983 method-of-execution challenges. The circuit court's denial of other postconviction relief was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant state bar brought a disciplinary action against respondent attorney alleging professional misconduct. The referee recommended that the attorney be found guilty of professional misconduct related to trust account violations and failure to file income tax returns since the time he became a lawyer. The referee also recommended that the attorney be suspended from the practice of law for six months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bar alleged that the attorney failed to prepare and maintain certain required trust account records and failed to file federal income tax returns and to pay federal income taxes from 1999 to 2006, despite having taxable income exceeding the threshold amount triggering the legal obligation to file. The referee found that the facts had been proven by clear and convincing evidence. The supreme court found that there was competent, substantial record evidence that the attorney was required to file federal income tax returns and that he had taxable income for the tax years 1999 to 2006. There was no support for the attorney's time-as-life-capital argument and this argument had been expressly rejected and labeled frivolous by the federal courts. As such, the attorney did not have a good faith belief that he was not obligated to file federal tax returns. The attorney should be permanently disbarred because he engaged in a lengthy course of conduct to impede and obstruct the collection of income taxes on his own income, for his own personal gain and declared his intention to persist in refusing to file income tax returns.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved the referee's findings of fact and recommendations of guilt, but disapproved the recommendations of sanction and, instead, permanently disbarred the attorney from the practice of law in Florida.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court held that because defendant, after consideration discussion with his counsel, chose to ask for a mistrial and there was no goading by the prosecution, the State was not barred from proceeding to a subsequent trial. Furthermore, one of the jurors suffered a seizure during deliberations which was an event that would qualify as an illness of a juror. In addition, the court found that defendant was fully cognizant of his actions, even exchanging pleasantries with a housekeeper. After his attack, defendant was able to locate the keys of the victim's truck, proceed directly to the truck, and drive away. Later he made a conscious decision to ram a police vehicle and attempt to elude capture.

The supreme court affirmed the trial court's denial of postconviction relief and also denied habeas relief. The inmate argued a Brady violation because the State failed to disclose two letters that a jail inmate wrote to the prosecutor, prior to trial, alleging that the brother of the inmate's girlfriend would lie. Although the supreme court agreed that the letters should have been disclosed, the inmate failed to establish prejudice. The jury was aware that the brother had entered a plea in order to avoid the death penalty. Accordingly, the defense was unable to show how the inmate was prejudiced by the failure to turn over the letters. Because there was competent evidence supporting the finding that no evidence was introduced to show that the brother's brother was threatened or promised favors in exchange for his cooperation, defense counsel could not have been considered ineffective for failing to impeach on evidence that did not exist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion for postconviction relief, the inmate asserted that his counsel was ineffective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insured sued respondent insurer for failing to pay personal injury protection (PIP) benefits after she was injured in an automobile collision. The Third District Court of Appeals (Florida) reversed a judgment in favor of the insured primarily due to her failure to comply with the pre-suit provision of Fla. Stat. &sect; 627.736(11)(a) (2001), which was enacted after the accident, and which imposed additional requirements for PIP benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pre-suit notice provisions instituted several amendments to the PIP law. It required an insured to provide a pre-suit notice of intent to initiate litigation and provided an insurer additional time to pay an overdue claim. The amendment also mandated that the payment from the insurer include interest and penalties not exceeding $ 250. If an insurer paid within the additional time provided by the statute, the payment precluded an insured from bringing suit for late payment or nonpayment and shielded the insurer from a claim for attorneys' fees. Further, the amendment tolled the applicable statute of limitations. On appeal, the court held that the pre-suit notice provision of &sect; 627.736(11)(a) could not be applied retroactively because it constituted a substantive change to the statute. In particular, the court found that the pre-suit notice provision was substantive, and not procedural, because it imposed a penalty, implicated attorneys' fees, granted an insurer additional time to pay benefits, and delayed an insured's right to file suit. Accordingly, the court found that the appellate court erred in its conclusion that &sect; 627.736 was procedural and given retroactive application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the appellate court's decision and remanded the case with directions to reinstate the trial court's final judgment, including the award of attorneys' fees. The court also instructed the appellate court to enter an order awarding attorneys' fees and to remand the issue to the trial court for a determination of the amount of fees for the proceedings at the appellate court and before the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Circuit Court in and for Martin County (Florida), appellant was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of sexual battery with great force arising from the 2004 strangulation murders of three victims. Appellant was sentenced to death for each murder. Appellant sought review of the convictions and death sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not err in finding the police officers were not obligated to readvise appellant of his rights immediately before the interview nor abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the first victim's homicide after finding it was substantially similar to the other two homicides. The collateral crime evidence was relevant to the issues of lack of consent, premeditation, intent, and absence of mistake. Given the circumstantial evidence of premeditation, appellant's admission that he killed the women, and the testimony of witnesses who saw appellant with the victims shortly before their disappearances, the evidence was sufficient to support the first-degree murder convictions on the theory of premeditated murder. The fact that each woman was killed during sexual intercourse--which was based on appellant's admission--was evidence supporting the finding that at some point, the sexual activity became nonconsensual. When the weighty aggravating factors were compared to no significant mitigation, there was no reasonable possibility the trial court would have imposed a different sentence had it not considered cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravator as to one victim.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that the trial court improperly found that the murder was heinous, atrocious, and cruel (HAC). On appeal, the court concluded that there was competent, substantial evidence to support the finding of the CCP aggravating circumstance including that defendant admitted that he was having homicidal thoughts, that defendant did not fly into a rage and attack his victim, but rather left to later return with the intent to kill her, and that he carefully formulated his plan. There was competent, substantial evidence supporting the HAC aggravating circumstance including that the victim struggled, that the victim was scratching and fighting defendant, and that the victim attempted to block defendant from strangling her. Finally, after reviewing the totality of the circumstances, the court determined that the death sentence was proportionate because the significant aggravators established in connection with the disturbing and brutal murder of the victim far outweighed the mitigating factors found by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred in admitting certain photographs. The court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the admission of the photographs because they were relevant to the jury's full understanding of the events surrounding the crimes and enabled the jury to see the relationship that defendant had with her codefendants and defendant's potential motive for planning and participating in the crimes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge was accused of improperly retaliating against a defendant who wished to file a motion to recuse and employed an over-technical and rigid approach in conducting the proceedings for pro se applicant who sought domestic violence injunctions. The court found that the doctrine of judicial independence did not preclude the JQC from proceeding with the specific charges against the judge. The hearing panel was authorized to consider the testimony of the judge that was presented during the investigative proceeding before the filing of the notice of formal charges. The judge's testimony before the investigatory panel indicated a clear intent to retaliate against the defendant for filing a motion to recuse. The judge refused to insert himself into the controversy when petitioners did not know they had a right to testify on their behalf, but had no problem with rejecting potential hearsay evidence sua sponte. The courtroom was not the proper venue for the judge to express his disagreement with what he perceived to be a serious flaw with the system. A public reprimand was warranted under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The committee sponsored an amendment to a county's charter which would impact the county's election procedures. Upon review, the court found that the Florida Legislature clearly did not deprive local governments of all local power in regard to elections and the Election Code did not impliedly preempt the field of election laws. In addition, the court found no conflict between &sect; 6.2A of the proposed amendment and the Election Code as the minimum requirement for voting machines would simply be expanded by the amendment. Section 6.2B of the proposed amendment also did not conflict with the Election Code as the Election Code did not establish any procedures for audits nor did it preclude a county from conducting its own audit of its voting system. However, &sect; 6.2C did conflict with the Election Code as it provided for an independent auditing firm to complete the required audits before the election results could be certified. Thus, it was unconstitutional. Finally, the court concluded that &sect; 6.2C could be severed from the rest of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer failed to pay personal injury protection (PIP) benefits to the insured after she was injured in an automobile accident. Because the insurer did not pay the benefits, the insured sued for overdue benefits. The insured was successful in her claim in the trial court, which eventually entered a judgment in her favor. On appeal, the appellate court reversed the judgment on multiple grounds, including the insured's failure to comply with a statute enacted after the date of the automobile accident (referred to as the statutory pre-suit provision)  that placed additional requirements on an injured person seeking to recover PIP benefits before filing suit. The supreme court found that the 2001 statutory amendment could not be applied retroactively because it allowed an insurer to avoid an award of attorneys' fees, which constituted a substantive change to the statute in effect at the time the insureds' insurance policy was issued. Under the statute in effect at the time the policy was issued, the insurer was obligated to pay a claim within 30 days after receiving notice of loss. Moreover, the insured had the right to bring suit for an overdue claim once the 30 days had expired.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court in and for Orange County (Fla.) denied his fourth and fifth successive motions for postconviction relief, filed under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of the brutal murder of an 84 year old woman. The supreme court found that the trial court did reach the merits of the newly discovered evidence claim and did apply the correct test, considering all the admissible evidence in the case to determine the merits of the claim. The inmate had not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in denying production for additional testing or that any of the testing would probably result in his acquittal. No specific procedures were mandated in the clemency process and the inmate had been provided with the clemency proceedings to which he was entitled. The inmate's claim of mental illness as a bar to execution was procedurally barred because it had not been raised on direct appeal on in any of the other postconviction proceedings. Mental illness was not a per se bar to execution. The inmate could not contend that his punishment had been illegally prolonged when the delay in carrying out his sentence was largely due to his own actions challenging his conviction and sentence. The trial court took reasonable steps to ensure that the shackles would not be visible to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted of first-degree murder, armed robbery and armed kidnapping. He was sentenced to death. The inmate filed a motion under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 to vacate his convictions and sentence. The Circuit Court in and for Duval County (Fla.) denied the guilt-phase claims but granted the inmate a new penalty phase. Both sides appealed. The inmate also petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the inmate failed to show prejudice resulting from trial counsel's decision not to depose certain individuals who testified against him at trial. The inmate did not established any specific information that trial counsel would have learned from attending the depositions of the witnesses that could have been used to impeach them at trial. The record showed that trial counsel filed numerous pretrial motions which rebutted the inmate's claim that trial counsel entirely failed to subject the state's case to a meaningful adversarial testing. The inmate could not demonstrate that trial counsel was deficient in his cross-examination of the witnesses. The inmate did not allege, or introduce any evidence to show, that he was absent from a pretrial hearing where evidence was adduced or where his consultation was required. The inmate failed to show that the state knew or suspected that certain witness testimony was false. When viewed in conjunction with the failures of trial counsel regarding the lack of investigation into mitigation, the failure of trial counsel to object to even one of the clearly improper remarks left the state's case virtually untested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court in and for Clay County (Florida), which denied his motion to vacate his conviction of first-degree murder and sentence of death filed under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his counsel was ineffective. Upon review, the court determined that contrary to defendant's assertions, trial counsel did not fail to investigate certain duct tape evidence and was not unaware that the victim moved about the house before the police arrived. While counsel did not choose the independent act theory as his primary defense, he did make that argument as a fall back defense. Thus, counsel could not be deemed deficient for failing to investigate the duct tape evidence because competent, substantial evidence supported the trial court's finding that trial counsel did investigate and utilize it at trial. Moreover, the court concluded that counsel's decision to pursue an alibi defense as the primary defense strategy was reasonable under the circumstances. Furthermore, even if counsel's actions could be considered deficient, defendant failed to establish that such deficiency resulted in prejudice to him. Finally, defendant failed to present a legally sufficient claim for habeas relief because his presentation of the issues was legally insufficient and thus, his claims were waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's order denying the motion for postconviction relief and denied defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in concluding that the evidence was sufficient to show that he killed the victim or to support premeditation, and in denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized at a campground. The court found that a rational trier of fact could find that the elements of the crime were established beyond a reasonable doubt as defendant was with the victim on the day before the date the victim was last seen, defendant was seen digging a hole on the next day, the victim told his girlfriend he was going to see defendant, and the victim was shot and buried alive near to the spot where defendant was digging. Substantial evidence supported the finding of premeditation including defendant's digging the hole, the victim's meeting defendant, and the victim being hot in the upper back at close range near the grave site where defendant was seen digging. The court held that there was no Fourth Amendment violation in the initial seizure of the property as it was removed for safekeeping purposes. Further, to the extent police retained possession of the property, there was no illegal seizure because at such point defendant had abandoned the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State claimed that defendant's prior aggravated battery charge should be used to establish a prior violent felony conviction aggravating circumstance. The court did not agree as since &sect; 921.0021, Fla. Stat., was limited to noncapital felonies, it was not intended for a broader definition of the word conviction to apply to the prior violent felony aggravating circumstance in capital cases. The court also found that the State did not violate the Confrontation Clause of U.S. Const. amend. VI when it failed to present the biologists who performed the DNA tests on a known sample taken from defendant and an unknown semen sample taken from the victim's shirt because the Confrontation Clause did not require the expert to have performed the actual laboratory work to permissibly testify with regard to the conclusions he drew from the results. In addition, the trial court did not err when it refused to suppress statements made by defendant's brother relating to comments made by defendant with regard to the sexual battery and murder of the victim. Finally, trial court did not err by admitting certain photographs although gruesome as they were relevant to a doctor's testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions, affirmed the sentences, and affirmed the denial of the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of six counts of first-degree murder, abuse of a dead human body, armed burglary of a dwelling, conspiracy (to commit aggravated battery, murder, armed burglary of a dwelling, and tampering with physical evidence), and cruelty to an animal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convinced that one of the victims had stolen some of his belongings. Defendant planned and executed a break in of the house where the victims were staying and he and the other co-defendants beat to death the victims with baseball bats. Defendant brutalized the death body of one of the victims and killed her dog. The court found that defendant freely and voluntarily consented to providing DNA samples and fingernail scrapings. Under the totality of the circumstances the improper use of &quot;and/or&quot; in the felony murder, cruelty to animals, and principals instructions did not constitute fundamental error. Application of the heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC) aggravator was appropriate because the victims were acutely aware of their impending deaths and the murders were both conscienceless or pitiless and unnecessarily torturous. Application of the cold, calculating and premeditated (CCP) aggravator was appropriate because defendant planned the murders, directed where each co-defendant should go once inside and gave each co-defendant a bat. The totality of the circumstances showed that death was an appropriate penalty.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner argued that the State had withheld evidence regarding a potential suspect who had the same first name as he. The court rejected this claim because there was ample evidence that this person was known to and even investigated by petitioner's attorney. The attorney even used the information to argue various motions to the trial court. Evidence known to the defense could not constitute Brady material. The court also rejected petitioner's argument that his sentencing counsel was ineffective for failing to present certain mitigating factors, such as a mental evaluation performed on petitioner. Sentencing counsel reviewed all the relevant records, obtained school records and jail records, interviewed petitioner and his family and friends, and obtained the appointment of the doctor who performed the evaluation. Much of the evidence was presented, and the evidence that was not presented was left out for strategic reasons. The State did not withhold evidence regarding a plea agreement with its main witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgments of conviction and sentences of death entered for the first-degree murders of the victims along with his concurrent sentences for two counts of robbery and two counts of kidnapping. The supreme court affirmed, stating that the evidence supported the jury's conclusion that defendant was guilty of the murders and that the murders were not the independent act of his codefendants. Foremost, defendant admitted that he was a willing perpetrator of the underlying felony, which was the robbery of the victims, that set in motion the kidnapping and murders. The kidnapping did not terminate prior to the death of the victims because liberty was never restored to them and they were never in a place of safety once the robbery commenced. It was also important to note that there was evidence that defendant planned the robbery and stated that he would murder the victims. The trial court's denial of the motion to suppress the contents of a motel room safe was based on the correct legal conclusion that the safe was encompassed in the search warrant and that law enforcement was not required to obtain a second warrant to access the contents of the safe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Circuit Court in and for Escambia County (Florida), which denied his motions under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 to vacate his judgment of conviction for first-degree murder and his sentence of death. Defendant argued, among other things, that the State withheld favorable, material evidence in violation of Brady and that his trial counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that additional information a witness provided did not demonstrate a Brady violation because it was not exculpatory or impeaching and was of questionable relevance. Defendant failed to show that a new trial was required based on newly discovered evidence. The case against him would not have been weakened to such an extent that he probably would have been acquitted even if the jury heard the recantation of a witness's testimony. The first two Brady prongs were established as to the State's failure to disclose a witness's statements, but even if a further evidentiary hearing was held to explore an investigator's notes, the third prong of Brady, prejudice, was not demonstrated. Trial counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate and present evidence of mental mitigation during the penalty phase. The evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing established that significant mental mitigation was available and could have been presented if defendant had been examined by a mental health expert. Failure to present the mental mitigation that was available had an identifiable detrimental effect on the process of weighing the aggravation and mitigation in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the trial court's order denying relief as to the guilt phase claims defendant raised. It reversed the trial court's order denying relief as to defendant's penalty phase claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in investigation and presentation of mental mitigation, vacated his sentence of death, and remanded for a new penalty phase proceeding before a jury, which could consider evidence of aggravation and mitigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While serving a life sentence for another crime, the inmate confessed to the murder of two women. The inmate pled guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and waived his right to a jury for the penalty phase. The circuit court concluded that the aggravating circumstances far outweighed the mitigating circumstances and sentenced the inmate to death on both counts. The inmate asserted ineffective assistance of counsel. The supreme court found that competent, substantial evidence supported the postconviction court's finding that the defense made a reasonable strategic decision to waive a penalty-phase jury based on the belief that the sentencing judge would be more receptive to the available mitigation than a jury would be. Trial counsel reasonably feared that testimony from a mental health expert would be more harmful than helpful. Given the substantial aggravation and the minimal mitigating value of the proposed mitigating evidence, there was no reasonable probability that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances would have been different had evidence of the inmate's mental health and history of sexual abuse been presented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant along with a co-defendant carjacked, kidnapped, robbed, and murdered the victims while engaged in a three-day crime spree that spanned several areas in Central Florida. The supreme court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the inextricably intertwined collateral crimes because the carjacking and drive-by shooting were integral threads to weaving a complete story of the murders. Defendant's strategic decision to present the penalty phase of the case to the trial court instead of a jury constitutes a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver and a conscious abandonment of any challenges to the constitutionality of Florida's capital-sentencing scheme. Defendant did not act out of frenzy, panic, or rage; he obtained a firearm in advance; he abducted and forced the victims to drive to a remote area where there would be no witnesses; and he shot the victims multiple times execution-style. The dominant or sole motive of these murders was witness elimination. Defendant's death sentences were not disproportionate when compared to the life sentences received by the codefendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court in and for St. Lucie County (Florida) on charges of first-degree murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, burglary of a conveyance while armed, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statement of the murder victim to police describing his attacker qualified as an excited utterance but not as a dying declaration. However, admission of the statement violated the Confrontation Clause as it was testimonial. Given the strength and nature of the other evidence connecting defendant to the crime, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The introduction of defendant's statements to police at the rooming house and their observations while did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights. While defendant was in custody when he made statements at the police station, he had been advised of his Miranda rights. The police had probable cause to detain or arrest him. The recorded conversations defendant had with his girlfriend from jail were not improperly admitted into evidence; they were not more prejudicial than probative. While the prosecutor's comparison of the choices made by the victim and defendant was improper, it was not fundamental error. Defendant's challenge to constitutional of Florida's death sentencing scheme failed. The evidence as to identification, premeditation, and whether a robbery was accomplished was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) filed a petition to terminate respondent mother's parental rights. Because the mother failed to appear at the adjudicatory hearing, the trial court terminated her parental rights pursuant to &sect; 39.801(3)(d), Fla. Stat. (2007), and denied her motion for a rehearing. She appealed; the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) reversed. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother appeared at the advisory hearing where the trial court informed her of the date, time, and location of the adjudicatory hearing, that her presence was necessary, and that she could lose her parental rights if she failed to appear. She also received written notice of these facts pursuant to &sect; 39.801(a). The intermediate appellate court held that, despite the mother's claims to the contrary, her implied consent to termination under &sect; 39.801(3)(d) relieved DCFS of the obligation to present evidence to support any of the statutory grounds for termination alleged in the petition. The high court agreed. To the extent S.S. v. State Department of Children and Family Services, 976 So. 2d 41 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2008), R.H. v.

App. 2006), held otherwise, they were rejected. However, the intermediate appellate court erred by reversing the termination judgment on grounds the trial court had not heard evidence as to the best interests of the child, as it took testimony from the child's guardian ad litem on this issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of first-degree murder and other crimes and was sentenced to death. The Broward County Circuit Court (Florida) denied his third and fourth successive motions for postconviction relief (PCR), which were filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851. It also denied the inmate's motions to correct the transcript. He appealed; appellee State opposed the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Co-defendant and the inmate were convicted of murder. The inmate argued that affidavits from co-defendant's fellow prisoners stating that he confessed to strangling the victim entitled the inmate to a new trial. The high court disagreed. The alleged statements were inconsistent and most of the witnesses did not believe them. This hearsay would not have been admissible during the guilt phase, and had it been admitted in the penalty phase under 921.141(1), Fla. Stat. (2008), the sentence would not likely have been less severe. None of the aggravators rested on the inmate's being the killer, and none were undermined by the newly discovered evidence. As the fourth successive postconviction motion was facially insufficient and meritless, any error in not holding a case management conference was harmless. Counsel's testimony that his performance during the penalty phase was deficient did not establish ineffective assistance. Any error in denying the motion to correct the transcript was harmless. As there was no legal issue requiring the resolution of a fact question, there was no basis for the inmate's request that the high court relinquish jurisdiction to conduct an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court affirmed the PCR court's orders denying the inmate relief and his motion to correct the transcript, and denied his motion to relinquish jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman to whom defendant was not married gave birth to their son. Defendant was ordered to pay child support. The woman and child then disappeared. An accomplice established that defendant, on a pretext, took them to a remote area where he strangled the woman and suffocated the child. A jury found him guilty of two counts of first-degree murder. He was then sentenced to death for the child's killing and given a life sentence for the woman's murder. The state supreme court found that (1) he did not show that fundamental error occurred regarding alleged improper remarks by the prosecutor; (2) admission of an incriminating recorded collect call between him calling from jail and his wife did not violate the &sect; 90.504, Fla. Stat. (2008) spousal privilege as defendant pursuant to &sect; 90.507, Fla. Stat. (2008) waived that privilege because a prerecorded warning at the start of the call stated that the call was subject to monitoring and recording, which forfeited any expectation of privacy; (3) sufficient evidence supported a denial of defendant's motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial; and (4) the death sentence was not a disproportionate penalty under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court in and for Broward County (Florida) convicted defendant of first-degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of shooting a pawnshop clerk in the head. The court stated that the circumstantial evidence, while perhaps sufficient to create some suspicion, was not sufficient to support a conviction The entire case against defendant consisted of the following evidence: a bag containing jewelry was taken during the robbery; (2) defendant's ex-wife found a bag of the same type containing jewelry in a closet of an apartment where she sometimes stayed with defendant and several other individuals, including another suspect; (2) defendant eventually sold the jewelry from the bag in the closet at a flea market; (3) defendant told a second person that the second person should always kill witnesses to crimes and that defendant had to do that. No evidence showed that the bag of jewelry the ex-wife found was the same bag of jewelry that was missing from the pawn shop safe. Even if the bags were the same, the other suspect as well as several other people had access to the closet where the bag was discovered, and defendant admitted that he sometimes helped the other suspect get rid of stolen merchandise. The evidence was equally consistent with a reasonable hypothesis of innocence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and vacated the conviction and sentence. It remanded the case with directions that a judgment of acquittal be entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to life in prison and incarcerated for the murder of a person. In that case, he had pled guilty to first-degree murder and had requested that the trial court impose a death sentence because he did not want to spend the rest of his life in prison. Just days after he was incarcerated, he strangled his cellmate. Regarding the most recent murder, defendant after being found competent pled guilty to first-degree murder, and waived a penalty-phase jury and presentation of mitigation at the penalty phase. After considering aggravation and mitigation evidence in the record, the trial court determined pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.172 that there was a factual basis for the plea and sentenced him to death. The state supreme court found that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily pled guilty. It then found that the fact that he had mental disabilities did not prohibit a finding that he committed the most recent murder in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner. It further found that the death penalty was not a disproportionate sentence and that Ring did not apply because he waived a jury trial by pleading guilty to the offense.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 3.851. The Circuit Court in and for Polk County (Florida) denied the motion. Defendant appealed, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that counsel had not been ineffective for failing to present the testimony of experts in the areas of forensic crime scene investigation or blood spatter. The strategy was to use effective cross-examination to challenge the legitimacy of the theory that defendant placed a bloody shirt under a bed. Furthermore, defendant had not shown prejudice because there was no evidence that an expert would have provided different information. Next, counsel reasonably investigated all leads provided by defendant, including questioning for additional information when encountering a dead end, only to be met with defendant's reluctance to provide anything more than vague details. Next, after defendant made a last-minute decision not to testify, he declined the opportunity for more time with counsel. This, combined with the representation that counsel spent five hours with defendant the night before in preparation for his testimony, supported the finding that trial counsel was not deficient in preparing defendant to testify. Finally, counsel provided reasonable, strategic explanations for not presenting an alternative suspect as a witness or further implicating him in the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the inmate was returned to custody after a supervision violation, the DOC declared a forfeiture of previously accrued gain time on his three conditional release eligible offenses.

The certified question asked whether, on revocation of conditional release, the DOC was allowed to calculate a new release date by using gain time forfeited on the release eligible sentence with the most accrued gain time, even if this method required incarceration beyond the concurrent sentences imposed by the trial judge. The appellate court answered the question in the negative. If the forfeited gain time on the inmate's sentence with the most accrued gain time was applied to make his new tentative release date proportionately later, he would have been required to serve more incarceration time than originally imposed by the sentencing judge. Sentencing was a power of the courts, not the DOC, and the DOC was not permitted to require an inmate to serve more incarceration time than imposed by the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a nonprofit public interest law firm and two members of the Florida Bar, sought to enjoin respondent, the Florida Bar, from permitting the Family Law Section (FLS) of the Bar to file an amicus brief in support of a trial court ruling that held a law prohibiting homosexuals from adopting children unconstitutional. The injunction was sought pursuant to authority under Art. V, &sect; 15, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The FLS was established pursuant to the authority vested in the Bar under R. Regulating Fla. Bar 1-4.5, and it was a voluntary section. The FLS was granted permission, by a unanimous vote of the Board of Governors of the Bar, to file the amicus brief in the matter. Petitioners opposed the filing and sought injunctive relief. The court held that the filing of the brief by the FLS did not violate petitioners' rights under U.S. Const. amend. I because membership in the FLS was voluntary and the advocacy was not funded by compulsory Bar dues. There was no violation of the Standing Board Policy Fla. Bar 8.10(a)(3), as the restrictions therein pertained to the Bar and not the voluntary sections thereof. Similarly, while the sections of the Bar were an integral part thereof under R. Regulating Fla. Bar 1-4.5 and 2-7.2, the standards and restrictions were not applicable to voluntary sections of the Bar. Further, the actions of the Bar did not constitute an ultra vires act because it had authority under R. Regulating Fla. Bar 2-9.2 to waive any of its standing policies. There was no cause for the court, in the exercise of its supervisory authority over the Bar, to grant an injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was serving a life sentence for murder. He tried to escape by jumping a fence, but was subdued. Prior thereto, he had killed an inmate and a corrections officer, and he injured another inmate. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to allow impeachment of a state witness with his prior correctional facility disciplinary report, as it was not a conviction under &sect; 90.610(1), Fla. Stat. (2006), and was not adequately explained. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. There was no evidentiary error in the penalty phase of the trial. A claim that counsel was ineffective was not reviewable where it was not apparent from the face of the record. Further, there was no error in consideration by the trial court of mitigating evidence. Although the trial court erred by addressing the issue of remorse, such error was harmless. The CCP aggravator was supported by the evidence, and defendant failed to show that he had a pretense of justification. The death penalty statute was not violative under Apprendi and Ring, and the sentences were proportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from the murder of his mother-in-law. The Court had affirmed defendant's first-degree murder conviction based on the theory of premeditated murder as well as had upheld the death sentence.

The court held that defendant failed to establish such ineffectiveness with regard to trial counsel failing to challenge the competency of two child witnesses because a sufficient factual basis existed for trial counsel to reasonably conclude that the children were competent based on trial counsel deposing both children before trial and observing their demeanor. The court found no ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to trial counsel's failure to object to alleged hearsay testimony of one of the children identifying defendant as the murderer as the testimony qualified as an excited utterance. Defendant further failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel failing to have counseling records of the children admitted as the legal entity controlling the records had asserted the psychotherapist-patient privilege.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner sought review of an order by the Circuit Court in and for Duval County (Florida) which denied his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 postconviction motion to vacate his judgment of conviction of first-degree murder and sentence of death. The prisoner had argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel as, inter alia, counsel was inadequate as to the presentation of mental health mitigation in the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner confessed to hiding in the victim's closet, raping her, an strangling her with an extension cord. His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. After remand on a sentencing issue, the appellate court affirmed the sentence of death. The appellate court held that, to the extent that the prisoner argued that counsel did not present any evidence of the prisoner's mental or emotional distress at the time of the crime, the record plainly refuted the claim. The prisoner also failed to demonstrate that counsel was ineffective in failing to request a doctor conduct neuropsychological testing. Counsel stated he was not aware of any reason to request additional testing. That in hindsight the mental health expert believed he should have done the testing did not alter the appellate court's analysis. Even if he had met the first prong of Strickland, he had not established prejudice. Because the prisoner's constitutional challenges failed, he had not demonstrated trial counsel error for failing to object to valid instructions, and his ineffective assistance claim failed as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Florida Association of Professional Lobbyists, initiated a facial challenge to a Florida Act, &sect;&sect; 11.045 and 112.3215, Fla. Stat. (2008), which regulated and disciplined lobbyists. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the Act was not unconstitutionally vague or overly broad under federal constitutional standards. However, the court certified questions of Florida law for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Association argued that the Florida Legislature, in enacting the Act and thereby giving itself the power to issue advisory opinions, investigate violations, and recommend punishment for infractions of the Act that it alone could approve, had directly encroached on the powers of the judicial and executive branches. The Association also claimed that the Act was not validly enacted by the Legislature according to the procedural requirements of the Florida Constitution. The Association also argued that lobbying was part of the general practice of law and that the Act was unconstitutional because it regulated and disciplined lawyers who worked as lobbyists and thereby encroached on the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Florida. The court found that (1) the Act did not violate Florida's separation of powers doctrine; (2) the Act was validly enacted by the Florida Legislature under Art. III, &sect;&sect; 3 and 7, Fla. Const.; (3) lobbying, as defined by the Act, did not constitute the practice of law so that the Act did not encroach on the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the Act was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions and held that the Act (1) did not violate Florida's separation of powers doctrine; (2) was validly enacted by the Florida Legislature; and (3) did not infringe on the Florida Supreme Court's jurisdiction to regulate lawyers or the practice of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) entered a decision concluding that the Administrative Procedure Act had to be followed when a school board immediately terminated a charter school charter pursuant to the school charter statute,&nbsp;&sect; 1002.33(8)(d), Fla. Stat. (2005), and determined &quot;essentially&quot; meant anything less than 90 days. The state supreme court granted petitioner school board's application for review of that decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent charter school company operated two separate charter schools. Both charters included provisions for immediate termination after 24 hours' notice. After a meeting regarding the proposed termination of the two charters due to severe fiscal mismanagement, the school board voted for termination. A notice given to the schools stated the termination was for &quot;good cause&quot; because of the mismanagement, based on &sect; 1002.33(8)(d), Fla. Stat. (2005), as well as the charter provisions, and would become effective in 24 hours. The Charter School Appeal Commission prepared written recommendations and the matter proceeded to the state education board for a final decision. The state education board voted to uphold the immediate termination of both charters. The appellate court found that the termination decision was subject to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and &quot;immediate&quot; termination in &sect; 1002.33(8)(d), Fla. Stat. (2005) only meant something less than 90 days. The state supreme court ruled that the APA did not apply because the charter school statute provided its own procedure contemplating immediate action subject only to the charter provision requiring 24 hours of notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court quashed the appellate court's decision and remanded the case to the appellate court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the trial court's ruling denying defendant's motion to suppress was proper, as competent, substantial evidence supported the trial court's finding that defendant was read Miranda warnings. A detective testified at the suppression hearing that he read defendant Miranda warnings from a prepared text, and defendant expressly stated on the tape-recorded confession that he had been read Miranda rights and understood them. The evidence supported defendant's murder convictions, as a victim identified defendant as the shooter in a photo lineup at a hospital and also in court. Defendant confessed to murdering the victims, and in those confessions demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of the crime and the crime scene. A statement made by the victim identifying &quot;the Mexican&quot; as the shooter was harmlessly admitted as an excited utterance, as there was substantial testimony by other witnesses that duplicated the statement. Defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to mitigation, and thus Koon was satisfied. Based on a comparison of defendant's death sentence to other similar death sentences, the sentence was proportional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim's home was burglarized and she was beaten, stabbed, and strangled to death. Defendant was linked to the murders by physical evidence at the scene, witness observations of him in the area of the crime, and his confession to a cellmate. Defendant's prior three trials either ended in a hung jury or reversals on appeal. After his fourth trial, he was found guilty of all charges. On appeal, the court found that admission of hair evidence was proper, as there was insufficient evidence of tampering and no Frye analysis required. Dismissal of the indictment was not warranted and no particularized need was shown for disclosure of grand jury testimony under &sect; 905.27, Fla. Stat. The prosecution's use of a peremptory challenge to strike an African-American venireperson was based on a legitimate race-neutral reason. There was no juror misconduct that required a mistrial and a reasonable doubt jury instruction was proper. Use of prior testimony for unavailable witnesses was not error, and there was no double jeopardy violation by the successive prosecutions. The evidence was sufficient to support the murder conviction, and the death sentence was proportional to the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for the 1982 murder of a woman, which involved abducting her from her office, taking her into some woods behind the building, attempting to rape her, stabbing her to death, and taking a ring from her finger.

Defendant asserted that the postconviction court erred by denying his motion for DNA testing, contending that he did not commit the murder and that the DNA testing would prove his innocence. The court found that the postconviction court properly denied the motion because it was reasonable for it to conclude that the results of the testing sought would not produce a reasonable probability of his exoneration, particularly based on his arrest at the scene of the crime just minutes after the victim's death and other significant factors. The court likewise upheld the postconviction court's denial of relief, and denied his petition for habeas corpus relief, based on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims upon finding that most were procedurally barred or that he insufficiently pled any error regarding those claims.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court also held that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant defendant's challenge for cause as to another juror where, defendant contended, there was reasonable doubt as to her ability to render an impartial verdict based on personal encounters with substance abuse through family members' drug addictions and her contacts with law enforcement and the criminal justice system, as the juror indicated she could put aside those things and base her verdict on the evidence and law. Next, the supreme court found an expert's presence during the penalty phase harmless, as, inter alia, he did not refute the factual testimony of the witnesses and admitted that he had observed the testimony of other witnesses. Finding of the avoid arrest aggravator was supported by, inter alia, the fact that the last of the attacks on the victim occurred when the victim was physically incapacitated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of the summary denial entered by the Circuit Court in and for Volusia County (Florida) of the inmate's successive post-conviction motion filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 challenging the mode of his eventual execution, which was to be by lethal injection. The inmate also filed a pro se all-writs petition under art. V, &sect; 3(b)(7), Fla. Const. seeking the removal of his appointed counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had been convicted in 1988 of first degree murder. While the inmate claimed that his successive motion for postconviction relief were upon newly discovered evidence, the trial court summarily denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing because he failed to comply with Rule 3.851(e)(2)(C) by failing to attach copies of the documents, such as Florida's 2006 lethal injection protocol, upon which his claim relied. The court affirmed based on the inmate's procedural error that rendered his motion legally insufficient. However, the court addressed the effect of Baze v. Rees, 128 S. Ct. 1520 (2008) on the validity of Florida's lethal injection protocol under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Art. I, &sect; 17, Fla. Const. Because the United States Supreme Court had not adopted a majority standard for determined the constitutionality of a mode of execution, the court had no reliable means of determining the narrowest grounds presented in Baze but concluded that the protocol would pass muster under any of the risk-based standards considered by the Baze Court. The court denied the all-writs petition as the appointed counsel filed the reply brief timely under Fla. R. App. P. 9.420(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary denial of the inmate's successive postconviction petition. The court also denied the inmate's all-writs petition. The court reiterated that nothing in Baze v. Rees, 128 S. Ct. 1520 (2008), affected the validity of the court's opinions upholding Florida's current lethal injection protocol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's convictions and death sentence for first-degree murder and other crimes were affirmed, he moved the Circuit Court in and for Alachua County (Florida) for postconviction relief, under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said recanted testimony entitled him to relief. The supreme court held the recanting testimony was unreliable because (1) it was inconsistent with medical testimony, (2) it was internally inconsistent, (3) the witness had a motive to change his trial testimony, and (4) the witness's claim that the transcript of his trial testimony was altered was not credible. The testimony would not probably produce an acquittal or conviction on a lesser charge because it still allowed conviction as a principal of premeditated or first-degree felony murder, nor would it probably have produced a life sentence recommendation, as it did not disprove aggravators of (1) a prior violent felony conviction, or (2) committing the murder during an armed robbery, and it showed two other statutory aggravators. Counsel's assistance was not ineffective because (1) voluntary intoxication was considered and rejected as inconsistent with a stronger alibi defense, (2) presenting defendant's antisocial personality disorder diagnosis would have harmed his penalty phase case, and (3) no substance abuse diagnosis supported a diminished capacity claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit (Florida) which summarily denied his successive motion to vacate three convictions of first-degree murder and corresponding death sentences under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851. He filed a successive motion for postconviction relief based on the discussion of inconsistent prosecutorial theories.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of the murder of three people during a robbery. The appellate court held the record demonstrated that the claim regarding inconsistent theories was procedurally barred and meritless as a new fundamental constitutional right was not recognized that applied retroactively. Even if the claim did not face a procedural bar, it would still fail because the State advanced a wholly consistent theory of the crime in prosecuting the codefendants. The prisoner failed to demonstrate that affidavits constituted evidence of such a nature that it would probably produce an acquittal on retrial. The general allegations, which did not specifically link the informant's comments to the prisoner's case or even the witness to the resentencing proceeding, could not supersede the plethora of evidence supporting the prisoner's convictions and sentences. Thus, the affidavits did not constitute newly discovered evidence that would probably produce a different outcome. There was no reasonable probability that the nondisclosure of an informant's status would have resulted in a different outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Circuit Court in and for Lake County (Florida) of first-degree murder of deputy one, and attempted first-degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm of deputies two and three, and his sentences, including a death sentence for the first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that a special heat of passion instruction was properly denied. The standard instructions properly advised the jury on premeditation. There was substantial evidence of premeditation to support the convictions for the first-degree murder of deputy one and the attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm of deputies two and three. Four victim impact witnesses were proper under art. I, &sect; 16(b), Fla. Const., &sect; 921.141(7), Fla. Stat. (2006), and U.S. amend. XIV. Fifty-four photographs on four posters showing deputy one in different settings were properly admitted. The proseuctor's closing argument comment urging the jury to compare the worth of the life of deputy one against that of defendant was erroneous, but did not deprive defendant of a fair penalty phase. The capital sentencing statute and jury instructions were constitutional. The use of a prior violent felony conviction as an aggravator under &sect; 921.141(5)(b), Fla. Stat. (2006) did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VI. The aggravators were supported by the evidence. Statutory mental mitigation was accorded some weight. The death sentence was proportionate under Fla. R. App. P. 9.142(a)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction for first-degree murder and the death sentence were affirmed.

The court held that the proposed amendments encompassed a single subject, did not engage in logrolling, and did not substantially alter the functions of multiple branches of government. The court held that the proposed amendments addressed a single function of a single branch of government, namely establishing additional guidelines for the Legislature to apply when it redistricts legislative and congressional boundaries.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner raised multiple claims concerning an expert's trial testimony concerning the extensive injuries suffered by the victim. The trial court found the prisoner's allegations of recantation by the expert as to the victim's sexual injuries to be an inaccurate characterization of the expert's testimony. Thus, the prisoner failed to show that the expert's postconviction testimony qualified as newly discovered evidence. Even if an expert's alleged change in testimony were considered sufficient to call into question the sexual battery conviction, it would not be sufficient to outweigh the evidence that the prisoner committed premeditated murder or to cast doubt on his conviction for first-degree murder based upon premeditation. The record did not support the prisoner's allegation that the expert's testimony was false as it did not materially change. Neither the State nor its actors suppressed evidence. The trial court did not err in holding the prisoner had not demonstrated deficiency of his trial counsel in regard to counsel's investigation of any mental health issues.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that collateral crime evidence was admissible under &sect; 921.141(a)(6) because it was probative of material issues and its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The court rejected the challenge to the constitutionality of Florida's lethal injection process. Defendant pointed to no new evidence supporting the argument that the process caused undue pain. The death sentence was proportionate because (1) the robbery aggravator was based on convictions of 13 other violent felonies and defendant's being on life parole at the time of the murder; (2) this case's facts were comparable to other murders during robberies where the death sentence was proportionate; and (3) limited mental impairment, consisting of a low to normal IQ and some difficulty in school, was not sufficiently weighty to compel a life sentence. Defendant was not entitled to a new penalty phase; the trial court did not rely on arguably improper lack of remorse evidence. The Ring claim was procedurally barred and meritless. There was insufficient evidence of premeditation, but the first-degree murder conviction was supported by substantial felony murder evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant had not met his burden under Strickland as to the guilt phase, he was not entitled to relief under &sect; 38.10, Fla.

However, defendant met both Strickland prongs as to the penalty phase. Counsel did not establish mitigation even though there was a wealth of witnesses who were not interviewed and documents that were not sought that could have fleshed out and established mitigating circumstances. Counsel only presented defendant's childhood and background information through the hearsay testimony of the public defender investigators--not from first-hand sources. Uncontroverted evidence that he had a type of neuropsychological impairment that affected his executive brain functions was available, but was not presented, at the penalty phase and would have qualified as nonstatutory mitigation. Had the facts been fleshed out or properly presented, a finding of no mitigation would not have been supported by the record. Defendant was prejudiced by the deficient performance and was entitled to a new penalty phase hearing.</SPAN></P>

Once defendant's IQ was found to be above 70, the trial court did not have to consider other statutory factors.

Resolving all evidentiary conflicts and all reasonable inferences in favor of the trial court's decision, the court found that there was competent, substantial evidence to support the determination; further, the &sect; 921.137 definition of mental retardation was constitutional, and the Equal Protection Clause did not require an extension of Atkins' interpretation of &sect; 921.137 to the mentally ill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both petitioner corporation and respondent county sought review of the decision in Phantom of Brevard, Inc. v. Brevard County, 966 So. 2d 423 (Fla. 5th DCA 2007), due to an alleged conflict with the decision in Phantom of Clearwater, Inc. v. Pinellas County, 894 So. 2d 1011 (Fla. 2d DCA 2005), related to whether substantially similar county ordinance provisions related to the regulation of fireworks conflict with ch. 791, Fla. Stat. (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation had claimed that Brevard County, Fla., Ordinance No. 05-60, as amended by Brevard County, Fla., Ordinance No. 06-18 (2006), was unconstitutional. While the Fifth District Court of Appeals had determined that ch. 791 did not expressly or impliedly preempt the regulation of fireworks, Brevard County, Fla., Ordinance No. 05-60, &sect; 10, requiring evidence of financial responsibility by sellers of fireworks, was found to be in direct conflict with ch. 791. That determination conflicted with a prior decision by the Second District Court of Appeals. In resolving the conflict, the court agreed with the Second District. Pursuant to art. VIII, &sect; 1(g), Fla. Const. the county had broad authority to enact ordinances that were not inconsistent with state law. The ordinance at issue was not inconsistent because &sect; 791.03 only provided that the county had to require at least a $500 bond from licensees. Thus, the county chose to legislate in an area where the state chose to remain silent. Any business that sold fireworks in the county could comply with the county's additional insurance requirement without violating any provision of ch. 791.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the decision in Phantom of Brevard to the extent it was inconsistent with the instant opinion and approved the decision in Phantom of Clearwater on the conflict issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In relation to a Brady claim, the court held that it was unreasonable to expect the prosecutor to become informed of and disclose the fact of a witness's arrest in the less than 24-hour period between the arrest and defendant's sentencing hearing. Moreover, the evidence would have been cumulative. Next, counsel was deficient under the Sixth Amendment in failing to conduct a reasonable investigation of defendant's mental health mitigation. Defendant had not shown prejudice, however, because the evidence would have likely proven more harmful than helpful. There were also significant aggravating factors. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to present additional witnesses to corroborate the testimony of defendant's sister about his traumatic childhood. This was a strategic decision made after considering alternative witnesses. Furthermore, the testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing was cumulative, and it would have only added to the nonstatutory mitigation found by the trial court. Finally, the standard penalty phase instructions fully advised the jury of the importance of its role, correctly stated the law, did not denigrate the jury's role, and did not violate Caldwell.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Later, the inmate filed a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 motion for postconviction relief against appellee State. The Circuit Court in and for Leon County (Florida) denied the motion. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that the postconviction court erred by denying his motion to disqualify all Second Circuit judges from deciding his Rule 3.851 motion. The appellate court agreed. In his Rule 3.851 motion, the inmate raised numerous ineffective assistance of counsel claims against his former trial counsel. His former trial counsel, however, had become a judge on the Second Circuit shortly after the inmate's trial. He served as a circuit court judge for almost eight years and was chief judge of the Second Circuit for three years. Currently, former defense counsel was an appellate judge on the Court of Appeal of Florida, First District, and heard appeals from, among other circuits, the Second Circuit. After former defense counsel's appointment to the appellate bench, his wife also joined the Second Circuit as a judge. Under these circumstances, it was reasonable for the inmate to fear that a Second Circuit judge hearing former defense counsel's testimony in determining the inmate's ineffective assistance of counsel claims would be biased in favor of former defense counsel and against the inmate. Thus, the inmate's motion to disqualify was based on a well-grounded fear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the inmate's motion for disqualification was reversed and the case was remanded for a new evidentiary hearing. On remand, the Chief Judge of the Second Judicial Circuit was directed to request a temporary assignment of a judge from outside the Second Circuit to preside over the inmate's new evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a federal district court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit certified two questions. It asked the present court to determine whether an aviation authority had become a joint owner with a private entity or whether it had given, lent, or used its credit to aid a private entity in violation of Art. VII, &sect; 10, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agreement was for a private commercial development company's long-term use of vacant land owned by the authority. The court held that the agreement did not violate the constitutional prohibition against joint ownership. Although an option to ground lease required the authority to construct a road extension, it had already been planned and budgeted, so the authority was not using public funds to create a prohibited joint ownership. The authority was also obligated to provide land for wetlands mitigation, but this provision did not make the parties to the agreement joint owners. Furthermore, the agreement did not meet all of the elements of the test for a joint venture. Next, the authority was not impermissibly pledging its credit to aid the company. The constitutional prohibition contemplated not just the use of public funds but the imposition of a new financial liability and a direct or indirect obligation to pay a debt of a third party. Under this standard, the authority had not given, lent, or used its credit to aid the company. Thus, the transaction needed to only serve a public purpose, which was fulfilled to the extent that the revenue might ultimately provide tax relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions in the negative and returned the case to the Eleventh Circuit.</SPAN></P>

Even though I don't know what I'm doing, I will have a better fighting chance.&quot; He followed this pronouncement with two separate pro se motions requesting self-representation. On appeal, the court found that defendant's statement at the hearing coupled with his pro se motions was an unequivocal and clear request for self-representation, to which defendant had a right pursuant to the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. The trial court's failure to hold a hearing to determine whether defendant could represent himself was per se reversible error. Although the State of Florida alternatively argued that the request was part of an ongoing attempt by defendant to delay and frustrate the proceedings, that did not mean that the trial court could fail to hold a hearing after the unequivocal request for self-representation. Further, the trial court did not make findings that defendant's motive in filing the motions was to delay his trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed error in denying his motion for mistrial when the prosecutor repeatedly commented in closing argument during the guilt phase on defendant's failure to testify at trial and silence after his arrest. The comment on the failure to testify was an erroneous comment on silence that was protected under Art. I, &sect; 9, Fla. Const.; however there was no abuse in discretion in denying the mistrial motion. Given the evidence linking defendant to the crimes, the error was not so prejudicial as to vitiate the entire trial. The trial court erred in overruling an objection to the State's questions as to unproven prior arrests and content of a tattoo. These errors were not harmless and required a new penalty phase proceeding. The questions suggested that defendant was a career felon in numerous states and created a risk that the jury would give undue weight to such information in recommending a death sentence. The tattoo questions were inadmissible nonstatutory aggravation under &sect; 921.141, Fla. Stat. (2007). While the lack of remorse questions did not individually amount to fundamental error, the cumulative effect of the errors deprived defendant of a fair penalty phase.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court concluded that the inmate had not shown prejudice. The sexual assault did not become the feature of the trial and was simply one act in a series that led to the offenses. In addition, it was clear that the inmate was the mastermind or dominating force behind the murder and attempted murder. The State also asserted that the trial court erred in granting the inmate a new penalty phase based on the ineffective assistance of counsel. The supreme court disagreed, finding that the inmate's waiver of the presentation of mitigating evidence was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made, and that the inmate suffered prejudice based on the invalid waiver. The supreme court found that defense counsel did not spend sufficient time to prepare for mitigation prior to the waiver and there was evidence that should have been presented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenge to the lethal injection protocol satisfied the Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851(d)(2) exception; it was based on an allegedly botched execution. However, summary denial of claims that lethal injection violated the Eighth Amendment was proper because the new process was not cruel and inhuman punishment. The American Bar Association report on Florida's death penalty system was not newly discovered evidence. There was no error in summarily denying the claim that a governor violated &sect; 922.06(2), Fla. Stat. (2004), in resetting an execution date beyond the statute's 10-day period; the prisoner had no enforceable rights under the statute. Further, 23 years on death row did not violate the Eighth Amendment; the prisoner contributed to the delay by filing five postconviction motions. An affidavit was not new, reliable evidence establishing that the prisoner was factually innocent. The prisoner was not deprived of his rights under chapter 119, Fla. Stat. and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.852, when the trial court granted objections to a public records requests; the records sought were not relevant. A Giglio claim failed because allegedly false testimony did not satisfy Giglio's third element.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate challenged an amended order of the Circuit Court of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit (Florida) denying his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 postconviction motion to vacate his murder, burglary, and kidnapping convictions and corresponding sentences of death and life imprisonment. Among other allegations, the inmate  alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The inmate also petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Counsel's competing factual proffer that provided sufficient factual support for each conviction was not deficient, given overwhelming guilt evidence. The unintentional killing of a minor during an intentional, premeditated killing of her mother rendered the minor's killing a murder in the first degree and a capital felony. The armed-burglary and kidnapping felonies also rendered the minor's killing first-degree felony murder. The doctrine of transferred intent converted the minor's killing into first-degree capital murder. Any prejudice due to counsel's off-the-cuff proffer was de minimis and would not have altered the guilty plea decision. The proffer was submitted to soften the facts for the penalty phase. The inmate was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to object to the admission of a murder-suicide letter the inmate sent to his wife; the letter would have been admitted through other witnesses. Because no valid defenses existed, an asserted ignorance of unsupported defenses did not affect the decision to waive a penalty-phase jury. The death sentences were legally sound. Habeas relief was not available for procedurally barred or meritless claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the amended order of the postconviction court and denied each of the inmate's claims. The court denied the inmate's habeas petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Counsel was not ineffective for failing to present testimony of two witnesses that a third witness admitted to killing the victim; there was no reasonable probability an acquittal would have resulted, given the physical and circumstantial evidence of defendant's involvement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of a decision of the First District Court of Appeal (Florida), which reversed a judgment in favor of petitioner on the basis that a two-year statute of limitations for defamation applied to a false light cause of action. The appellate court certified conflict with Heekin v. CBS Broadcasting, Inc., 789 So. 2d 355 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001), which held that the four-year statute of limitations for unspecified torts applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court certified the following question: Is an action for invasion of privacy based on the false light theory governed by the two-year statute of limitations that applies to defamation claims or by the four-year statute that applies to unspecified tort claims? Upon consideration, the court declined to answer the certified question but approved the decision reversing the judgment in favor of petitioner. Based on a decision by the court after the appellate court's decision, it had been determined that Florida did not recognize the tort of false light invasion of privacy because the benefit of recognizing the tort was outweighed by the danger in unreasonably impeding constitutionally protected speech. Thus, the analysis of the applicable statute of limitations was unnecessary and moot. While petitioner argued that the court could not retroactively abolish the cause of action, the court had previously determined that the tort never existed at common law and any prior statements concerning false light were dicta. Based on that determination, the court disapproved of Heekin, which had assumed the existence of a cause of action and discussed the elements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declined to answer the certified question. The court approved the result of the appellate court's decision but not the reasoning to the extent that a cause of action for false light existed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Appeal (Florida) affirmed an attorney fee award made by the Judge of Compensation Claims in favor of petitioner employee. In so ruling, it found that an award of reasonable attorney fees under &sect; 440.34(1), Fla. Stat. (2003) in a workers' compensation case had to be made under the formula in &sect; 400.34(3), Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a certified nursing assistant, suffered an injury while helping to lift a patient.

The Judge of Compensation Claims (JCC) found the employee's testimony to be credible and awarded her a certain sum in benefits. The JCC then found that the employee's counsel expended eighty hours of time on the case but determined that the attorney fee award pursuant to &sect; 440.34(3), Fla. Stat. (2003), was governed by the statutory formula of &sect; 440.34(1), Fla. Stat. (2003). The JCC the found that those provisions dictated an unreasonable attorney fee award of $ 684.84, equating to an hourly rate of $ 8.11, despite testimony that a normal rate was $ 200 per hour. The appellate court affirmed the fee award. The state supreme court found that because the statutory provisions read together were ambiguous given that they did not always result a reasonable fee award, a reasonable fee award had to be determined in a workers' compensation case by applying the factors in R. Regulating Fla. Bar 4-1.5(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court quashed the appellate court's decision and directed that the case be remanded to the Judge of Compensation Claims (JCC) for entry of an attorney fee award that the JCC previously calculated would be a reasonable fee. It also found that the employee was entitled to an award of reasonable appellate attorney fees to be determined by the JCC.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court found that (1) he did not show he received ineffective assistance of counsel by trial counsel during the penalty phase presenting more compelling mitigation witnesses who knew defendant around the time of the crimes rather than long before them, (2) he did not show he was entitled to a new trial based on a juror not disclosing information not relevant or material to jury service, (3) failure to object to the State's &quot;Golden Rule&quot; comments in closing argument was harmless, (4) his Vienna Convention claim had to have been raised earlier, and (5) he was properly precluded from amending his postconviction motion to add four additional claims because he did not show good cause for allowing the amendment as to any of the claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an inmate under the sentence of death for, inter alia, committing first-degree murder, appealed an order of the Circuit Court in and for Broward County (Florida) which summarily denied his postconviction motion to vacate his conviction of first-degree murder and sentence of death. He also petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus. Defendant had argued, inter alia, that trial counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The postconviction trial court denied all of defendant's claims without holding an evidentiary hearing. The appellate court noted a comment by the prosecutor did not constitute an improper golden rule argument because it does not ask the jurors to place themselves in the victim's position. Defendant had not alleged how he was prejudiced in his trial defense by the admission of this document. The postconviction court summarily denied defendant's claim pertaining to the lack of any voir dire. The appellate court disagreed that the claim was insufficiently pled as defendant asserted that his trial counsel did not request a Frye hearing as to the expert and the testimony required a Frye hearing. Defendant did not need to provide specific factual allegations as to what his trial counsel should have elicited from the expert. The expert's testimony was the kind of testimony which required a Frye evaluation by the trial judge. Since appellate counsel did not raise a Gray claim as to defendant's convictions for attempted first-degree murder, appellate counsel was ineffective as the convictions would have been reversed. However, no new penalty-phase was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's rulings were affirmed as to all issues raised in the postconviction motion except those issues alleging that defendant's counsel was ineffective in failing to request a Frye hearing before the opinion testimony of the State's expert was admitted into evidence. On that issue, the matter was reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing. Defendant's convictions and sentences for attempted first-degree murder were vacated.</SPAN></P>

Stat. (2005) unconstitutional. The rephrased certified question asked was whether, on its face, the Act unconstitutionally deprived upland owners of littoral rights without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After damage by hurricanes and tropical storms, beaches within the county were identified as critically-eroded beaches, and the county sought to restore the beaches through renourishment. Once a permit was issued for the project, respondent, a not-for-profit association consisting of six beachfront property owners, challenged the issuance of the permit and raised constitutional challenges. The appellate court found the Act unconstitutional. The court answered the certified question in the negative and quashed the appellate court's decision. The Act was facially constitutional under the doctrine of avulsion as the boundary between public lands and privately owned uplands remained the mean high water line (MHWL) as it existed before the avulsive event, such as a hurricane. Thus, if the shoreline was lost due to avulsive event, the public (in this case, the county) had the right to restore its shoreline up to the MHWL under &sect; 161.161(5). The littoral right of accretion was not applicable as, inter alia, &sect;&sect; 161.088, 161.101(1), Fla. Stat. did not apply to de minimis additions or losses of land. The littoral right of access was explicitly preserved under the Act in &sect; 161.201.</SPAN></P>

A medical examiner testified that the victim's death was &quot;instantaneous&quot; upon impact. Defendant was convicted. At sentencing, the State successfully argued for adding victim-injury points, which increased his sentence. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant was not informed by his state-appointed appellate counsel about the appellate court's decision until it was too late to file a notice to invoke jurisdiction under Fla. R. App. 9.120(b). The state supreme court then granted defendant's motion for reinstatement. It found that it could treat his belated notice as timely filed because his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance. It also found that because &sect; 921.0021(7)(a), Fla. Stat. (2001) defined &quot;victim injury&quot; as injury suffered as a direct result of an offense, the victim-injury points could not be imposed in defendant's case because the victim's death was not directly caused by defendant leaving the scene of the accident.</SPAN></P>

(2001) and Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.160. The court concluded that the postconviction court erred by denying this motion because defendant demonstrated a well-founded fear of judicial bias. In his motion for postjudgment relief, defendant raised numerous ineffective assistance of counsel claims against his trial counsel, an attorney who ran for a circuit court judgeship while defendant's case was still pending and who became a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. After the judge's appointment to the bench, his wife also joined the Second Circuit as a judge. Under these extraordinary circumstances, it was reasonable for defendant to fear that an appellate judge hearing the judge's testimony in determining defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim would be biased against defendant. On remand, if any witness invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege to avoid testifying, the postconviction court must determine whether that witness was entitled to the privilege.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney sued appellee state official, seeking, inter alia, a declaration that &sect; 27.7002, Fla. Stat. (2007) violated the courts' inherent authority under art. V, Fla. Const. and the separation of powers under art. II, Fla. Const. After the Circuit Court in and for Leon County (Florida) granted the attorney summary judgment, the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) certified the cross appeals as matters of great public importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the appellate court's prior decision in the case, the attorney had standing to obtain a declaratory judgment of his rights as he was appointed as registry counsel for a death-sentenced inmate in postconviction proceedings. The prior decision did not foreclose the instant complaint as &sect; 27.7002, Fla. Stat. (2007) was enacted after the prior decision was rendered. Thus, the complaint presented a justiciable controversy. The circuit court construed &sect; 27.7002(5) and (6), Fla. Stat. (2007) to permit compensation above the statutory fee schedule in appropriate cases and to permit attorneys to request such compensation when justified by unusual or extraordinary circumstances, noting that the provisions had to be so construed in order to preserve the statute's constitutionality. The appellate court agreed because interpreting the statute to mean that fee caps could not be exceeded in any circumstances rendered it unconstitutional. The statute had to be interpreted and applied to ensure effective and competent representation in complex and unusual capital postconviction proceedings in order to afford death row inmates meaningful access to counsel in their collateral proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court in and for Orange County (Florida), which denied his motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851. Appellant had been convicted of, inter alia, first degree murder, sexual battery, and kidnapping of a child under the age of 13 and had been sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant motion raised constitutional challenges to the state's death penalty scheme; the motion was summarily denied in its entirety. On appeal, the court affirmed. While appellant argued that &sect; 922.105, Fla. Stat. (2006) violated the separation of powers doctrine by giving the state department of corrections (DOC) unfettered discretion to create a lethal injection protocol, the court had previously rejected such an argument. The state's lethal injection procedures did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII based on precedent holding that additional procedural safeguards in 2007 by the DOC addressed prior deficiencies. Claiming that American Bar Association (ABA) Resolution 122A constituted newly discovered evidence, appellant argued that he was exempt from execution based on severe mental illness; however, the Resolution did not contain anything that would cause the court to recede from prior decisions upholding the constitutionality of the death penalty. The claim was untimely, and on the merits, mental illness had not been recognized as a per se bar to execution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death after a state correctional officer was killed as part of an escape attempt by him and two other inmates. The state supreme court first determined that it would not review defendant's five claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. It found that such claims were normally raised, not on direct appeal, but pursuant to a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 postconviction motion. The state supreme court also found as to other issues that (1) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress a statement he gave to law enforcement, as the trial court's order sufficiently recited findings and conclusions in support of its ruling, (2) competent, substantial evidence supported the jury's verdict, (3) he did not preserve a claim that the State took inconsistent positions about who masterminded the escape, (4) no error occurred in denying his motion for mistrial regarding reference to a prior sentence since the reference did not vitiate the entire penalty phase, (5) his death sentence was proper, (6) the jury was properly instructed, and (7) alleged cumulative error was not shown.</SPAN></P>

The motion to suppress the physical evidence seized from defendant's temporary residence was properly denied where the warrant was sufficiently precise to include the seizure of his shoe laces, particularly as stains were observed on them. The denial of a motion for a mistrial was upheld as the alleged error was not preserved for appeal. A motion for judgment of acquittal was properly denied where defendant's own trial testimony and statements to the police linked him to the murder scene and murder weapons, and the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to find him guilty. However, as to one victim, there was insufficient evidence that defendant had abused a dead human body. The motion to sever the trial from that of two codefendants was properly denied under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.152(b)(2) where defendant failed to identify codefendant statements that would have been inadmissible had he been tried alone.

The attorney relied upon &sect; 876.05, Fla. Stat. The court found that the attorney's arguments and positions were both inaccurate and legally insufficient. Each of the justices on the court had taken the oath of office as prescribed by the Florida Constitution. Further all of the justices had executed judicial office loyalty oaths and oaths of office at the time of appointment and for each retention election thereafter. All of the justices appointed in 1998 or earlier executed written, notarized oaths of office that complied with &sect; 876.05. The court also found that the referee who presided over the attorney's case complied with the constitutional requisites before assuming the duties of his office. Further, the Florida Constitution established the requisite oath for the judicial officers, not &sect; 876.05. If there were any actual defect in the oath, it would be cleared by the de facto officer doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate appealed an order of the Circuit Court in and for Duval County (Florida) denying his motion for postconviction relief under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found no merit in the inmate's claim that the trial judge erred in granting the inmate's motion for disqualification, as the mere presence of a sentencing order in the State's file, without more, did not give rise to a well-founded fear that defendant would not receive a fair trial. The supreme court also concluded that trial counsel was not ineffective at the guilt phase for conceding guilt, as it was a strategic decision made in an effort to obtain credibility for seeking a &quot;jury pardon,&quot; and the inmate, after having discussed the strategy with defense counsel, consented to the strategy. The inmate's claim that defense counsel was ineffective at the penalty phase also failed, as counsel investigated mitigating evidence, but found witnesses who could do more damage than help. Finally, the supreme court concluded that the inmate was not entitled to a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, the life sentence imposed on codefendant, because the inmate did not establish that codefendant was the dominating force and there was substantial evidence that the inmate was the triggerman and thus, the more culpable one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intervenor raised three issues: (A) whether the circuit court abused its discretion in denying his motion for continuance, (B) whether the circuit court's final judgment was supported by competent, substantial evidence, and (C) whether the bonds required a referendum pursuant to art.

With regard to the second issue, the intervenor argued that the circuit court's adoption of the County's proposed final judgment was an improper delegation of authority. This contention was without merit because the intervenor was afforded a meaningful opportunity to review the County's proposed final judgment, make objections, and make his own proposals. Next, the court stated that the findings in the Ordinance and Resolution were not shown to have been clearly erroneous. Finally, the third issue was controlled by the court's decision in Penn, in which the court previously affirmed the Circuit Court's validation of bonds issued under a similar tax ordinance and resolution and issuance structure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Bay County (Florida) which invalidated tax-increment-financed bonds proposed for issuance by the city pursuant to the Community Redevelopment Act. However, the trial court found no merit to appellee county's challenges to the city's finding of blight, to the city's finding of conformity, and to the constitutionality of tax increment financing. The county cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted a bond ordinance which authorized it to issue bonds for the purpose of financing capital projects identified in a redevelopment area. Absent its approval of supplemental ordinances, the tax increment revenues deposited into the trust fund were the only source of revenues pledged to repay the bonds. After receiving notice of the city's intention, the county sought to enjoin the city from enforcing its Community Redevelopment Act resolutions and ordinances. The appellate court held the plain language of the Community Redevelopment Act did not require it to levy ad valorem taxes in order to issue the proposed tax-increment-financed bonds. Te general statement in &sect; 163.358, Fla. Stat., the Community Redevelopment Act, listed the discrete steps a county or municipality had to undertake to employ tax increment financing, and no step required that the city levy ad valorem taxes. The appellate found that the Community Redevelopment Act did not require the city to levy ad valorem taxes in order to issue the proposed tax-increment-financed bonds. The trial court also correctly concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the city's legislative finding of blight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's conclusion that the city could not issue the proposed bonds because it did not levy ad valorem taxes was reversed. The trial court's conclusions regarding the finding of blight, the finding of conformity, and the constitutionality of tax increment financing was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of first-degree murder, sought postconviction review after his conviction and death sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.

It found, inter alia, that penalty phase counsel performed a reasonable investigation into defendant's background to discover potential mitigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death for the killing of his son-inlaw. The victim was murdered by defendant's mentally challenged 22-year-old son, who strangled him to death under defendant's direction. In sentencing defendant to death, the trial court found three aggravating circumstances, including that the murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding a lawful arrest. Defendant primarily criticized his trial counsel for a so-called &quot;rifle&quot; approach, which highlighted strong mental mitigation, rather than a &quot;shotgun&quot; approach that would include any and all factors discovered by counsel that might conceivably be considered mitigating. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that defendant failed to demonstrate that counsel was deficient in his mitigation investigation or presentation. Counsel presented the information he was able to obtain, given the reticence of family members and his own client to report any unfavorable family history and the inability to obtain certain records. If counsel had put on additional mental health evidence, it would have opened the door to further possibly damaging evidence. The remaining examples of ineffective counsel were also unavailing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee town filed complaints in the Circuit Court in and for Bay County (Florida), for validation of bond proposals. Appellant county intervened in the proceedings. Appellee, the State of Florida, required strict proof of the matters alleged but did not otherwise object to validation. After conducting a consolidated hearing, the circuit court entered final judgments validating the bond proposals. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town proposed two tax-increment-financed bonds pursuant to the Florida Community Redevelopment Act, pt. III of ch. 163, Fla. Stat. (2006). The county contended that &sect; 163.346, Fla. Stat. (2006), required two public readings for resolutions adopted by the town pursuant to the Act. In addition, the county argued that the proposed tax-increment-financed bonds violated the referendum requirement of art. VII, &sect; 12, Fla. Const. On appeal, the court found that, because &sect; 163.346, Fla. Stat., incorporated only the public notice requirements of &sect;&sect; 166.041(3)(a) and 125.66(2), Fla. Stat. (2006), &sect; 163.346 did not impose a two-reading requirement for resolutions adopted pursuant to the Act. As a result, the town was not required to conduct two readings at two public meetings when enacting its redevelopment resolutions. In addition, the proposed bonds did not violate art. VII, &sect; 12, Fla. Const. because the proposed bonds did not pledge the taxing power of any government entity. The bondholders had no right, if the trust funds were insufficient to meet the bond obligations, to compel the levy of ad valorem taxation. Consequently, the proposed bonds were constitutional without a referendum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Florida Department of State, sought review in the Florida Court of Appeals of a decision of the trial courts in and for Leon County, (Florida), which entered a summary judgment in favor of appellees and ordered a proposed amendment 5 removed from the November 2008 ballot. The appellate court certified the matter to the court for immediate resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida Taxation and Budget Reform Commission proposed an amendment (Amendment 5) to the Florida Constitution that would impact and change several aspects of Florida's taxation and financial structure. Appellees contended in their lawsuit that the ballot title and summary for proposed Amendment 5 were misleading, and the trial court entered a summary final judgment that ordered proposed Amendment 5 removed from the ballot. The court agreed with the trial court that the proposed Amendment 5 was misleading, fatally defective, and not in compliance with the requirements of &sect; 101.161, Fla. Stat. (2007). The title and the summary incorrectly gave the impression that every year that school districts did not levy an ad valorem tax they would receive equivalent revenues from the State, when in fact that had only been established for one fiscal year. Further, the scope of Amendment 5 covered more than school property taxes, and this was not made clear in the information presented for the ballot question.</SPAN></P>

No Brady violation occurred based on an alleged failure to disclose evidence of an agreement with the witness as the witness, a detective, and the prosecutor all denied that any promises to benefit the witness were made. As no promise had been made, any testimony as to the witness's release from jail was not false; thus, no Giglio violation occurred. While trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate evidence of mental health mitigation based on an available report of a forensic psychologist that appellant suffered from mental illness, appellant was not prejudiced as substantial aggravators (prior felony conviction and heinous, atrocious, or cruel) were presented and other conflicting evidence indicated that appellant was not mentally ill but suffered from an antisocial personality disorder.</SPAN></P>

Appellee president of the corporation's medical staff opposed the petition. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the trial court held that the HGL violated Art. III, &sect; 11(a)(12), Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate appellate court found, inter alia, that the HGL altered many of the rights and obligations specified in the contract between the corporation's medical staff and its board of trustees, constituting an impermissible privilege. The appellate court found, among other things, that the HGL provided the hospital with a complete override of medical staff bylaws. Moreover, Ch. 2003-372, &sect; 5, at 448, Laws of Fla. granted the corporation's board of trustees the right and power to unilaterally amend the medical staff bylaws, something it could not do before enactment of the HGL. The HGL altered the framework for governing, and the medical staff's important role in it pursuant to the bylaws, in a manner favorable to the board, and essentially gave the board plenary power to take independent action in these areas. These facets of the HGL granted the corporation a &quot;right&quot; and placed it in an advantageous position, one that it did not possess before the law was enacted. The HGL granted the corporation rights, benefits, or advantages and thus, a &quot;privilege&quot; in contravention of Art. III, &sect; 11(a)(12), Fla. Const. The unconstitutional provisions were not severable.</SPAN></P>

Even if counsel's performance had been deficient, appellant was not prejudiced as substantial aggravators were found as the trial court concluded that the first victim's death was cold, calculated, and premeditated (CCP) and the second victim's death was heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC).</SPAN></P>

While appellant claimed that his counsel was ineffective for failing to thoroughly investigate his background and present evidence in mitigation of, inter alia, his father's alcoholism and abuse, counsel could not be found ineffective for the failure of appellant's family to admit to the alcoholism and abuse; counsel presented the information through the testimony of a clinical psychologist. Defense counsel was also not ineffective for presenting psychological testimony that was somewhat conflicting; while both psychologists did not agree that a statutory mitigator of extreme mental or emotional disturbance would apply, the CCP and prior violent felonies aggravators far outweighed that mitigator as the offenses in which appellant had been involved all utilized some sort of planning, indicating that appellant knew the difference between right and wrong.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 448.24(1)(b) (2004) for overcharging day laborers for transportation to various worksites.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reaching the constitutionality issue had been unnecessary. The actual damages claimed was minimal compared to Fla. Stat. &sect; 448.25(1) (2004)'s statutory damages. Thus, the Act was penal in nature, to be construed in favor of the labor hall. Fla. Stat. &sect; 448.24(1)(b) (2004)'s plain language established that the Legislature intended for &quot;to or from the designated worksite,&quot; in the first clause, to modify the entire second clause, which included the more general &quot;geographic area.&quot; Reasonable testimony had shown that transportation in the area was predicated upon a tri-county basis published by a regional transportation authority. The &quot;geographic area&quot; was based upon the public-transportation system in place for a particular area. &quot;Public transportation&quot; was not limited to bus travel in the area. The cost associated with traveling from a bus stop to the worksite, and its return at the end of the day had to be taken into account in determining a reasonable transportation charge. The labor hall's charge of $ 1.50 for site-to-site transportation was a &quot;reasonable amount.&quot; Given the rates for taxi service, $ 1.50 did not exceed the cost of public transportation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed with regard to the holding that the Act was unconstitutional, but the labor hall was not liable for the alleged violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress and granted the State's motion for denial of the motion, defendant was tried and convicted of burglary, grand theft, and criminal mischief. The Court of Appeal of Florida, First District, affirmed the convictions, and certified conflict with another district court. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was in custody on another matter, an investigator asked him for a saliva sample, stating that he was suspected of committing a supermarket burglary. In fact, the investigator had manufactured the fictitious supermarket burglary in order to obtain defendant's consent to take swabs for a sexual-assault case. Defendant was exonerated in the sexual-assault case, but the saliva was used to convict defendant in the current case. The issue was whether defendant's consent was involuntary. The appellate court found, among other things, that defendant was aware that the officer wanted the DNA sample in order to investigate a crime, and the officer did not misrepresent the fact that he had no search warrant. The officer did not indicate that defendant had no choice regarding whether to provide a DNA sample. The custodial setting of defendant's consent and the investigator's failure to inform defendant of the actual purpose of the search were not factors so controlling as to overpower defendant's will. Defendant was not deluded as to the import of his consent. However, the appellate court distinguished rather than disapproved the other case believed to have been in conflict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court approved the decision of the intermediate appellate court to affirm the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress the saliva swabs.

His community control was ordered revoked when pornography was found in his home.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's decision that defendant could not, under former &sect; 948.03(5)(a)(7), Fla. Stat. (1999) (now &sect; 948.30(1)(g), Fla. Stat. (2007)), possess any pornography as a condition of his community control conflicted with another court's decision that such pornography had to be relevant to an offender's deviant behavior. The supreme court held the statute could be reasonably construed in at least four ways. It could not be interpreted in a manner that rendered some of its language superfluous, and neither the bill title nor a staff analysis clarified it. The doctrine of the last antecedent did not show the phrase &quot;that are relevant to the offender's deviant behavior pattern&quot; qualified the phrase &quot;sexually stimulating visual or auditory material.&quot; Given the statute's ambiguity, the rule of lenity in &sect; 775.021(1), Fla. Stat. (2007), requiring that any ambiguity be resolved in defendant's favor, had to be applied, so &quot;relevant to the offender's deviant behavior pattern&quot; qualified all pornography defendant was barred from possessing, and he violated the statute only if material found in his home was relevant to his &quot;deviant behavior pattern,&quot; which had not been addressed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, burglary during which an assault was committed, and theft of a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in an incident, wherein he forced an individual at gunpoint to put duct tape on victims' mouths and plastic bags over their heads, asked him to slit their throats, and then ordered him to shoot them in the head. One of those victims died as a result. The individual who was forced to act testified against defendant at trial, as did other witnesses. Defendant was convicted and the trial court imposed the jury's recommendation of the death sentence. On appeal, the court found no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's mistrial motion, as improper prosecutorial comments were not so prejudicial as to deny defendant a fair trial. Testimony by a detective was not improper bolstering of his own credibility where he explained that the goal of his investigation was to find the truth. There was sufficient evidence to support the cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravator, as well as the murder convictions. There was nothing improper in the prosecutor's use of the word &quot;terrorize&quot; to explain an assault. The sentence was not unconstitutional under Ring, and the sentence was not disproportionate in the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner driver sought review of a decision from the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida), which affirmed that the permanent revocation of his driver license by respondent, the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, and the elimination of hardship eligibility pursuant to &sect;&sect; 322.28(2)(e) and 322.271(4), Fla. Stat. (2000; 2003), was not an ex post facto law. A question of great public importance was certified on the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was convicted of DUI on four occasions. Pursuant to &sect; 322.28(2)(e), his license was permanently revoked. Although there was a provision that allowed for license eligibility upon a showing of hardship at the time that the driver's license was revoked, that provision was eliminated in an amendment pursuant to &sect; 322.271(4). The driver's petition for a hardship license was denied, and his requests for a writ of certiorari were denied by the trial court and the court of appeals upon the determination that there was no ex post facto violation. However, a question of great public importance on the issue was certified to the court for review. The court held that the Ex Post Facto Clauses of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Art. I, &sect; 10, Fla. Const., were not violated by the statutory scheme, including the amendment. The court analyzed the matter under the seven-factor ex post facto test and found that the license revocation and hardship eligibility elimination were not criminal provisions, as they were part of a regulatory scheme to protect the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed a rival drug dealer. The supreme court held the victim's phone call was an excited utterance because a gunman's announced intent to kill him, described in the call, was sufficiently startling. Defendant opened the door to hearsay by volunteering hearsay to answer a proper question, which could be clarified with the entire statement. A comment that he would not further implicate a person who ordered the murder did not comment on his right to remain silent because he did not invoke the right. His proposal to modify the standard heinous, atrocious and cruel aggravator instruction was denied because it was covered by the standard instruction, which told the jury to focus on his acts' effect on the victim. Comments on circumstances leading up to the murder were not fundamental error because they related to the victim's perception of and reaction to his impending death. Testimony that the victim knew he would die wrongly exceeded what the witness saw but was harmlessly brief and based on testimony from which the inference could be made. Evidence supported the heinous, atrocious and cruel and cold, calculated and premeditated aggravators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of an order from the Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida), which denied his motion under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 to vacate his conviction for first-degree murder and his sentence of death. The inmate was convicted of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, armed robbery, aggravated assault, grand theft, and burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against the inmate and others arose from the shooting death of a law enforcement officer during a bank robbery. The inmate made unrecorded and recorded confessions, detailing his and co-defendants' involvement in the incident. He was convicted of all charges and sentenced to death. An appeal resulted in an affirmance of his convictions, but the death sentence was vacated. On remand for resentencing, three merged aggravating factors were found to outweigh mitigating circumstances, and a sentence of death was again imposed. The convictions and sentence were affirmed on appeal, and the inmate's postconviction motion was denied. On appeal, the court found no ineffectiveness of counsel during the guilt and penalty phases on a number of issues raised by the inmate, such that summary denial on most of the claims was proper. Either counsel acted properly or no prejudice was shown. A co-defendant's sentence to life imprisonment was not newly discovered evidence that warranted relief under Rule 3.851. Denial of disclosure regarding certain records was proper, as they were exempt, and Ring did not apply retroactively to invalidate the inmate's sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the Florida House of Representatives and its Speaker, filed a petition for a writ of quo warranto that disputed respondent Florida Governor's (FG) authority to bind the State to a gambling &quot;compact&quot; with the Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida. The compact significantly expanded casino gambling on tribal lands in return for substantial remuneration to the State under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2701-2721.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indian Tribe signed the gambling &quot;compact&quot; with the FG, which regulated &quot;gaming.&quot; The Florida Legislature did not authorize the FG to negotiate the compact before it was signed, and it did not ratify it thereafter. Rather, petitioners brought their action. The court initially determined that it had jurisdiction over the writ petition pursuant to Art. V, &sect; 3(b)(8), Fla. Const., based on the importance and immediacy of the issue. The court reviewed various exercises of authority with respect to compacts. The court held that the Legislature had the power under the residual authority power to execute the compact at issue. Further, the court determined that the &quot;necessary business&quot; clause of Art. IV, &sect; 1(a), Fla. Const., did not authorize the FG to execute the compact because it was contrary to the expressed public policy of Florida or was prohibited under Florida law. Lastly, the court concluded that the compact violated the separation of powers under Art. II, &sect; 3, Fla. Const., as it violated Florida's public policy about the types of gambling that was allowed. Such was the type of action particularly within the Legislature's power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner House of Representatives filed a petition for a writ of quo warranto against respondent Governor; the House claimed that the Governor lacked authority to bind the state to a compact allowing Class III gaming on Indian lands, pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2701-2721 (2000) (IGRA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After almost 16 years of sporadic negotiations with four governors, the Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida signed a gambling &quot;compact&quot; with the Governor. The compact authorized the Tribe to conduct &quot;covered gaming,&quot; which included some Class III gaming, such as banked card games, that was prohibited under &sect;&sect; 849.08, 849.086(12)(a), (15)(a), Fla. Stat. The state supreme court held that the Governor did not have the constitutional authority to bind the state to a gaming compact that clearly departed from the state's public policy by legalizing types of gaming that were illegal everywhere else in the state. Because the compact changed the state's public policy as expressed in the criminal law, it violated the separation of powers clause in Art. II, &sect; 3, Fla. Const. IGRA did not grant the Governor, or any state actor, any powers beyond those provided by the state's constitution and laws. By authorizing the Tribe to conduct banked card games that were illegal throughout Florida--and thus illegal for the Tribe--the compact violated Florida law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner community development sought review of a decision from the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) which, inter alia, held that respondent county property appraiser had standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 189.403(1), Fla. Stat. (1999), as an affirmative defense (AD). A direct conflict between that decision and one from the Second District Court of Appeal was certified for the court's review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The development filed three actions against respondents, a county and/or state officials, alleging that pursuant to &sect; 189.403(1), it should have been treated as a municipality and granted exemptions for ad valorem tax purposes. The development alternatively asserted constitutional rights violations. The appraiser asserted by way of AD that &sect; 189.403(2) was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the development's motions to strike the AD upon finding that the appraiser lacked standing to raise that issue. The trial court thereafter determined that the development was entitled to the requested tax exemptions. The court of appeals held, inter alia, that the appraiser had standing to raise the AD, and the matter was remanded for consideration thereof. On certification of a conflict with a decision of the Second District Court of Appeal, the court reviewed the history of a property appraiser's standing. It held that an appraiser lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute as an AD in a tax suit by a taxpayer. In so holding, the court disapproved the holding of Fuchs v. Robbins, 818 So.2d 460 (Fla. 2002), which had been relied on by the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court resolved the conflict by holding that a property appraiser lacked standing in his official capacity to raise the constitutionality of a statute as an AD in a tax suit by a taxpayer. Accordingly, the court approved the holding of the Second District Court of Appeals and quashed the appellate court's decision in the instant action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's PCR motion was similar to his prior motions, which also challenged Florida's lethal injection protocol. The PCR court noted that a defendant could not succeed on an Eighth Amendment objection to a method of execution unless he could proffer a feasible, readily implemented procedure that would, in fact, significantly reduce a severe risk of pain, The inmate's suggestions for additional training of prison personnel and a reduction in the amount of sodium pentathol did not meet this test. The inmate did not show that Florida's protocol for lethal injection significantly differed from Kentucky's, which had been approved by the U.S. Supreme Court, or that Florida's protocol created a demonstrated risk of severe pain. The high court adopted the PCR court's reasoning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued newly discovered evidence entitled him to a new trial. The high court disagreed. A medical examiner's testimony at the postconviction hearing that there was a one-in-a-million possibility the victim's vaginal injuries were caused by a kick was not a recantation of his trial testimony that the injuries were caused by insertion of an object into her vagina, and thus was not &quot;new evidence.&quot; As the examiner's trial testimony was not false, there was no Giglio violation, and as it was essentially unchanged, the State did not suppress evidence in violation of Brady. Trial counsel was not deficient for failure to discover such evidence, or in preparing defendant to testify. The inmate received a competent mental health evaluation at trial, and did not prove counsel's investigation of this issue was deficient. Counsel was not deficient in investigating mitigating factors or in not calling the victim's daughter as a witness. A PET Scan was not newly discovered evidence entitling the inmate to relief, as two experts testified the scan did not indicate brain damage. The inmate's constitutional claims, not having been preserved on direct appeal, were procedurally barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to robbery. The trial court sentenced him as a habitual felony offender to 20 years in prison. He appealed.

The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At sentencing, the State presented evidence of prior felony convictions. Defense counsel objected, arguing that the evidence failed to show the prior convictions were &quot;separately sentenced,&quot; as required by &sect; 775.084(5), Fla. Stat. (2001), of the habitual offender statute. The trial court overruled the objection. The intermediate appellate court held that the documents presented to the trial court failed to preclude the possibility that all of defendant's prior felony offenses were originally sentenced on the same date. It prohibited the State from correcting the error on remand by producing additional evidence. The high court held that this prohibition conflicted with rulings of the First, Fourth, and Fifth District Courts of Appeal (Florida), and that the latter rulings were correct. As resentencing was de novo, the State could produce new evidence to prove defendant's habitual offender status, and his Double Jeopardy Clause rights were not thereby violated. Shull v. Dugger did not apply to habitual offender sentencing. The due process inquiry was whether the new sentence was vindictive; the presumption of vindictiveness would arise only if a more severe sentence was imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court approved the decision of the intermediate appellate court reversing defendant's sentence, but quashed the decision to the extent it precluded the State from introducing additional evidence on remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After consuming LSD, the inmate choked the victim, injected her with bleach, and stabbed her. The high court held that counsel was not deficient for failing to call experts at a suppression hearing to testify that the inmate's sleep deprivation and his being under the influence of LSD made his confession involuntary, as the Rule 3.851 testimony did not support these claims, and suppression of the confession was unlikely to have changed the outcome. As police did not use the &quot;question first, warn later&quot; method of questioning in a calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning, the inmate's Siefert claim failed. His Giglio claim failed as he did not show an officer's testimony was false and the prosecutor knew it. Not calling an expert to substantiate the inmate's voluntary intoxication defense was not ineffective assistance, as the expert testified at the Rule 3.851 hearing that LSD ingestion would not have negated the inmate's ability to plan. Penalty phase counsel was not deficient for failing to adduce mitigation testimony from an expert that could have done more harm than good, in preparing the expert, or for failing to rebut the cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent State prosecuted petitioner inmate, and she was convicted of aggravated battery with a weapon. The inmate appealed on grounds that the trial court erred in hearing testimony from the victim for purposes of sentencing without defense counsel being present in the courtroom. The Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) affirmed, concluding that this &quot;sentencing error&quot; was not preserved. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate did not preserve by contemporaneous objection her claim of a deprivation of counsel during part of a victim impact statement. The intermediate appellate court held that this was a claim of sentencing error and therefore should have been preserved for appeal as required by Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(e) by filing a motion under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b). The high court disagreed. A claim of partial deprivation of counsel during a sentencing hearing was a due process violation, not a &quot;sentencing error&quot; as contemplated by Rule 3.800(b), and therefore no motion under Rule 3.800(b) had to be filed. The unpreserved claim was therefore reviewable on appeal for fundamental error. The high court held that the temporary absence of counsel during a portion of the victim's testimony was not fundamental error. Counsel participated during a portion of the victim's testimony, and when counsel joined the hearing, the trial judge summarized the substance of the testimony counsel had not heard. At that point, counsel had the opportunity to question the victim (who was still on the stand). Thus, counsel's absence did not go to the foundation or merits of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ruling of the intermediate appellate court was affirmed, but its reasoning--that the &quot;sentencing error&quot; was not preserved--was not. Counsel's temporary absence was not a sentencing error, but an unpreserved due process violation that did not amount to fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The First District Court of Appeal (Florida) had certified a question as to the denial of a petition for adoption by petitioners, the maternal grandfather and his wife: did the trial court abuse its discretion granted by ch. 63, Fla. Stat., when it denied the petition, after determining petitioners to be fit prospective parents, on the basis that the denial was in the children's best interest for ensuring the paternal grandparents' involvement?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children's mother had died shortly after the younger child's birth. The father died shortly thereafter in an automobile accident. The children then moved into petitioners' home. After petitioners sought to adopt the children, respondents filed a petition to have the paternal grandmother appointed as guardian. While the evidence indicated that petitioners were fit prospective parents, the trial court awarded guardianship of the children's persons to petitioners and guardianship of the children's property to respondents. The appellate court affirmed and certified a question, which the court answered in the affirmative. Because the State had a compelling interest in providing stable and permanent homes for adoptive children under &sect; 63.022(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2005), the issue before the trial court was whether the adoption by petitioners was in the children's best interests without consideration of some other form of custody such as guardianship. The split guardianship was the antithesis of the right to permanence and stability as, inter alia, guardianships required continuing judicial involvement under &sect; 744.3675, Fla. Stat. (2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question in the affirmative and quashed the decision of the appellate court and directed that the case be remanded to the trial court with directions that the petition for adoption be granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied as procedurally barred the inmate's guilt phase claims and denied his resentencing claims on their merits. The supreme court held witnesses who said the inmate's now deceased brother admitted committing the murder were not credible, so the inmate was not entitled to a new trial. Not disclosing a hair analyst's poor evaluation did not violate Brady or Giglio because (1) nothing showed the analyst mishandled hairs in the inmate's case, (2) the hairs were destroyed, (3) excluding the analyst's testimony would not likely produce an acquittal, (4) the evaluation did not exist at trial, and (5) nothing showed the analyst falsely testified. Resentencing counsel was not ineffective for not objecting to the victim's sister's testimony because it was admissible to show an enumerated felony was committed during the murder and a heinous, atrocious and cruel murder. Resentencing counsel was not ineffective for not asking an expert if the inmate had (1) an extreme mental or emotional disturbance or (2) a substantial impairment of his capacity to appreciate his conduct's criminality or to conform it to the law given mitigation presented and aggravators proved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of first-degree murder, attempted sexual battery, and burglary; he was sentenced to death. He filed a motion for postconviction relief (PCR) under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851, which the Palm Beach County Circuit Court (Florida) denied. He appealed and petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed the PCR court erred by summarily denying certain claims. The high court disagreed, finding them all meritless. Counsel was not ineffective for not moving to suppress the inmate's confession under &sect; 90.410, Fla. Stat. (1999), as his own testimony showed he did not have a reasonable belief he was negotiating a plea when he confessed. As an expert's testimony about the inmate's psychological impairment was inadmissible to support an insanity defense, and would have harmed the defense, counsel was not deficient in failing to present it. He did not establish a Brady violation, as he knew about his counselor's notes, which he claimed the State suppressed, and they were not material. He did not show counsel was deficient for not removing three jurors, as there was no showing they were biased. He did not show counsel was deficient during the penalty phase for not presenting evidence of his substance abuse, as such evidence likely would not have changed the sentence. The jury was properly instructed on mitigation. Appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise certain issues on direct appeal because they probably would have been found to be without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court affirmed the motion court's order and denied the inmate's habeas petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery with a firearm and was sentenced to death. His death sentences were twice overturned on appeal. After the second reversal and remand, the Circuit Court in and for Osceola County, Florida, sentenced defendant to death after conducting a Spencer hearing. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the sentencing order, the trial court relied on information that was not presented during the third penalty-phase proceeding. The high court held that this was error, since a resentencing proceeding was de novo and began with a &quot;clean slate''; it thus gave no weight to such evidence. The trial court properly rejected the age mitigator, as there was no evidence defendant was not functioning as a typical 21-year-old at the time of the crime. Giving little mitigation weight to the fact that the mother was a drug addict while pregnant with defendant, and used drugs when he was a child, was proper, as there was no evidence this had any impact on him. In view of the meager evidence that defendant was physically or psychologically abused, the trial court properly gave these factors little weight as mitigation. Any error from the use of special-verdict forms for aggravators and mitigators was harmless. The death sentence was proportionate to other cases in which one had been imposed, in view of defendant's three prior violent felonies, and the fact that the murder was committed while defendant was robbing the victim. The jury instructions and method of execution were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The death sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the trial court of driving under the influence (DUI). He appealed. The intermediate court of appeal affirmed. He sought certiorari review. The Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) held that admission of certain portions of a breath test affidavit violated defendant's constitutional right to confrontation under Crawford, remanded the case for a new trial, and certified a question to the high court for its review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The breath test technician who administered the breath test to defendant and prepared a breath test affidavit under &sect; 316.1934(5), Fla. Stat. (2007), did not testify. The affidavit was admitted over defendant's objections. The high court held that the breath test affidavit was &quot;testimonial&quot; for purposes of Crawford because it was created to prove a critical element in the DUI criminal prosecution, not during an ongoing emergency or contemporaneously with the crime. As it was undisputed that the technician had left the State to avoid a criminal charge, the State met its burden to show she was unavailable at trial.  Defendant did not waive his opportunity to cross-examine the technician by failing to depose her under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.220(h)(1)(D). Therefore, as he had no prior opportunity for cross-examination, admission of the affidavit violated his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the second intermediate appellate court was affirmed, and its certified question was answered as follows: Admission of those portions of the breath test affidavit pertaining to the breath test operator's procedures and observations in administering the breath test constituted testimonial evidence and violated the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause as interpreted by Crawford.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Polk County Circuit Court (Florida) of two murders and other crimes. After his two death sentences were reversed and the case was remanded, he was sentenced to death for one murder, and to life imprisonment for the other. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to killing an elderly couple. After a second sentencing hearing, the trial court followed the jurors' recommendation. Defendant argued that dismissing two jurors for cause because they were not proficient in English violated his right to a jury composed of a fair cross-section of the community. The high court held that exclusion of the jurors was valid as a &quot;public necessity&quot; under &sect; 40.013(6), Fla. Stat. (2005), because Florida case law banned interpreters from jury rooms during deliberations. Further, defendant failed to show that the class of Hispanics not proficient in English was a distinctive group in the community. An informant's testimony that defendant admitted fondling the wife was relevant to the nature of the crime and was thus admissible under &sect; 921.141(1), Fla. Stat. (2005). Evidence that the 74-year-old wife had not regained the strength in an arm she had broken supported the aggravating factor that the victim was particularly vulnerable due to advanced age or disability. The death sentence was proportional to other similar crimes. Florida's execution protocol, including a three-drug cocktail, did not violate the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former client sued appellee attorney for malpractice. A jury found the attorney negligent but awarded the client no damages; the trial court awarded the attorney expert witness fees. The client appealed the fee award on grounds the attorney had not complied with &sect; 57.071(2), Fla. Stat. (1999). The First District Court of Appeal (Florida) affirmed, finding that &sect; 57.071(2) was unconstitutional. The client appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney represented the client in a personal injury case. Pursuant to their retainer agreement, they submitted their dispute about settlement to arbitration. The arbitrator decided the client should accept the settlement.

The trial court granted the attorney's motion and directed the client to sign the settlement; the client refused, discharged the attorney, and hired other counsel. The trial court appointed a guardian ad litem to sign the release on behalf of the client; it divided the contingency fees between the attorney and new counsel. This suit followed. The client argued that the intermediate appellate court erred in finding &sect; 57.071(2), which provided a time limit for filing a written report, unconstitutional. The high court disagreed. As it was &sect; 92.231(2), Fla. Stat. (2007), that created the right to tax expert witness fees as costs, &sect; 57.071(2), Fla. Stat., was exclusively procedural in nature. It thus impermissibly encroached on the high court's rulemaking authority conferred by Art. V, &sect; 2(a), Fla. Const., thereby violating the separation of powers provision, Art. II, &sect; 3, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate challenged the circuit court's determination that he was not mentally retarded in accordance with the three prongs of Fla.

Moreover, the trial court questioned the validity of the only IQ score falling within the statutory range for mental retardation. Therefore, evidence supported the finding that the inmate did not meet the first prong of the mental retardation definition. The evidence also supported the trial court's conclusion that the inmate failed to prove the second prong--impairments in adaptive functioning. Aside from personal independence, the inmate demonstrated that he was healthy, well-nourished, well-groomed, and exhibited good hygiene. Likewise, there was no evidence of deficits of adaptive behavior in regards to home living, use of community resources, or leisure. The inmate did not meet the third prong, onset of significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive behavior before age 18. Anecdotes about the inmate's childhood were insufficient to meet this definition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that defendant murdered two victims and attempted to murder a third; thus, the prior violent felony aggravator, &sect; 921.141(5)(b), Fla.

In light of the totality of the circumstances, including a very weighty prior violent felony aggravator based on a first-degree murder conviction, an attempted first-degree murder conviction, a prior robbery involving the use of a firearm occurring just one year before the murders, and minimal nonstatutory mitigation, death was a proportionate punishment as to the murder of one victim. If the death penalty was proportionate for the first-degree murder of that victim, then a fortiori it was a proportionate punishment for the first-degree murder of the second victim, because the trial court found an additional aggravating circumstance, murder to avoid arrest, applicable to the second victim. Although defendant's full-scale IQ was low, there was competent, substantial evidence that he understood his Miranda rights and voluntarily waived them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued counsel was ineffective during the penalty phase closing argument. The high court held that while the argument was brief, counsel made a strategic decision not to focus on the inmate's substance abuse or to present possibly damaging testimony from family members. Though counsel's failure to file a sentencing memorandum may have been deficient, there was no prejudice, as the trial court independently identified and weighed the mitigating and aggravating factors. Counsel was not ineffective in presenting mitigating evidence; the inmate did not produce any mitigating evidence at the PCR hearing that was not presented at trial. Appellate counsel was not ineffective for not challenging the constitutionality of R. Regulating Fla. Bar 3.575, as the inmate did not allege trial counsel was denied a post-trial juror interview under Rule 3.575. The inmate's claims that Florida's death penalty statute violated Apprendi and Ring failed, as those cases did not apply retroactively. His claim his incompetence precluded his execution under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.811 was not ripe for review as he had been not been found incompetent. Execution by lethal injection was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a state association of criminal defense lawyers, sued appellants, the Florida Governor and others, alleging ch. 2007, &sect; 62, Laws of Fla. (the Act), violated art. V, &sect; 18, Fla. Const. The trial court granted the association's petition for a writ of quo warranto; appellants sought review. The First District Court of Appeal (Florida) certified the order as one requiring immediate resolution by the high court, which accepted jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act created five Florida Offices of Criminal Conflict and Civil Regional Counsel (OCCCRC) to handle representation in criminal cases where a public defender had a conflict. The association filed a petition for writ of quo warranto, asserting that the Governor exceeded his constitutional authority by appointing the regional counsel for the OCCCRC, and that the Act violated art. V, &sect; 18, Fla. Const., which required that the public defender in each circuit be elected. The high court disagreed. The Act supplanted the prior system of private registry counsel and did not establish de facto public defenders in violation of the Florida Constitution. The OCCCRC did not perform the duties of, compete with, or displace the public defenders. Defendants were guaranteed the right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment and art. I, &sect; 16, Fla. Const; that right encompassed the right to representation free from actual conflict. The mere creation of the OCCCRC did not adversely impact either the independent judgment of the appointed attorneys or the right of defendants to effective representation under the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court reversed the trial court's order and held that the Act did not violate the Florida Constitution by allowing for the appointment and confirmation of the five regional counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of strangling a woman. At the PCR hearing, an FBI agent admitted, after checking his bench notes, that hair found in the victim's hand, which he identified at trial as the victim's, was in fact not suitable for testing. The inmate alleged this was exculpatory evidence the State withheld in violation of Brady and the State knowingly presented false evidence in violation of Giglio. The appellate court held that while the agent's trial testimony about the hair was false, as the evidence was neither intentionally withheld nor exculpatory, there was no Brady or Giglio violation. The inmate claimed his sentencing counsel was deficient for failing to call family members and a nurse to testify as to his childhood abuse, since this would have resulted in substantial mitigation and a life sentence. The appellate court disagreed. Defense counsel submitted ample testimony about such abuse. He made a strategic choice not to call certain witnesses, and the testimony the inmate referred to would have been cumulative to that provided by other witnesses. Moreover, such mitigation was overcome by aggravating factors. His other claims were unpreserved or without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two malpractice cases, trial courts granted respondents, patients one and two, discovery from petitioners, hospitals one and two. The hospitals appealed. The First District Court of Appeal (Florida) held that to the extent &sect; 381.028, Fla. Stat., limited art. X, &sect; 25, Fla. Const., it was unconstitutional. The Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) held that art. X, &sect; 25, Fla. Const., did not apply to existing records. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida Patients' Right-to-Know About Adverse Medical Incidents Act, &sect; 381.028, Fla. Stat. (2005), implemented Amendment 7, art. X, &sect; 25, Fla. Const., which gave the public access to information about adverse medical incidents involving health care providers. Patient one sought discovery of documents relating to the investigation of the adverse medical incident at issue. Patient two sought discovery of documents relating to the retention or termination of a doctor. Each hospital objected, claiming such information was confidential under statutes predating Amendment 7. The high court agreed with the intermediate appellate courts that Amendment 7 was self-executing. As the statutory guarantee of confidentiality previously afforded reports of adverse medical incidents created by and for peer review committees did not give health care providers a vested right in such confidentiality, application of Amendment 7 to records existing before its passage was constitutional. Section 381.028(2), (3)(j), (5), (6), and (7)(a), Fla. Stat., were unconstitutional, as they curtailed rights granted by Amendment 7; however, they could be severed, leaving the remainder of the statute enforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court affirmed the first intermediate appellate court's decision that patient one was entitled to discovery from hospital one under Amendment 7, and that &sect; 381.028, Fla. Stat., was unconstitutional in part. As to the denial of patient two's discovery request, the high court reversed the second intermediate appellate court's ruling that Amendment 7 could not be applied retroactively and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted first-degree premeditated murder; he appealed the conviction. The Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) affirmed. It ruled that a self-defense instruction, to which defendant had not objected, was erroneous, but did not constitute fundamental error. Defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stabbed his girlfriend multiple times in the face, arm, chest, and back. He claimed she had attacked him with scissors. The self-defense instruction stated that the use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm was not justifiable if defendant was attempting to commit, committing, or escaping after the commission of an attempted murder and/or aggravated battery. The high court held this instruction was erroneous, as there was no independent forcible felony other than the one which defendant claimed he committed in self-defense. However, the erroneous instruction did not deprive defendant of a fair trial and, therefore, fundamental error did not occur. First, his claim of self-defense--that he was fighting for his life--was so weak as to defy credulity, in view of the victim's serious injuries and the 1/4 inch cut he sustained to his pinky finger. Second, self-defense was not his sole defense; he also argued that he was intoxicated and acted in a drunken frenzy rather than with premeditation. The high court disapproved of those decisions that held that an erroneous reading of the forcible-felony instruction always constituted fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate dropped a concrete block on the victim's head and strangled him to death. He claimed his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to present an expert to testify to mental mitigation. The appellate court held that the decision not to call the psychologist was a reasonable strategic decision, as her testimony could have opened the door to other damaging testimony. Due to negative aspects of her opinion, it was also a reasonable strategic decision to not present her testimony at the Spencer hearing. Based on the inmate's confession, counsel were not ineffective in not calling an expert to refute the opinion of the State's expert as to the heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC) aggravator. The inmate presented no factual basis under Rule 3.851(e)(1) for his claim counsel were deficient in presenting mental mitigation. His Apprendi, Ring, and Crawford claims were meritless. As the inmate did not show a reasonable probability that the prosecutor's comments affected the verdict, and as photos of the victim were properly admitted to support the applicability of the HAC aggravator, appellate counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise meritless claims based on these issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of premeditated and felony murder (with burglary as the predicate felony) for each of three killings. The Duval County Circuit Court (Florida) followed the jury's recommendation and imposed death sentences for two of the murders and life in prison for the third. Defendant appealed his convictions and death sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went to his girlfriend's home and fatally shot her, her new boyfriend, and her minor child. He claimed that the child was shot accidentally, and that before the shootings, he had taken antidepressant pills and drank several glasses of whiskey. The high court rejected his claim that &sect; 775.051, Fla. Stat. (2002), which barred the defense of voluntary intoxication, was unconstitutional. The trial court's finding that the murders of the boyfriend and girlfriend were committed during a burglary and in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner was supported by substantial evidence. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in assigning great weight to the burglary aggravator under &sect; 921.141(3), Fla. Stat. (2002), as to the adults and not as to the child, as the adults were the victims defendant originally targeted. The State's promise to Mexico not to execute defendant was conditioned on Mexico's sending him to Florida, which it did not do. As the jury unanimously convicted defendant of three murders, which was basis for the trial court's finding of the prior violent felony conviction aggravator, there was no Ring violation. The death sentences were proportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court affirmed defendant's convictions and death sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant death row inmate sought review of an order of the Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida), which denied the inmate's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 motion to vacate his convictions on two counts of first-degree murder and his sentences of death. The inmate also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus. The inmate had also been convicted of, inter alia, attempted murder, kidnapping, armed kidnapping, racketeering and armed extortion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the denial of the Rule 3.851 motion holding inter alia that (1) the trial court's testimony on behalf of one of the victims in that victim's own federal fraud trial did not provide a basis for disqualification of the trial court from considering the Rule 3.851 motion; (2) no Brady or Giglio violations occurred during the trial proceedings; (3) the claim that the trial court erroneously denied all but one postconviction claim without an evidentiary hearing was insufficiently pled on appeal; and (4) denial of the inmate's motion to amend the Rule 3.851 motion was not an abuse of discretion as counsel failed to timely file the motion to amend. The habeas petition, which asserted multiple claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, was denied. Appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise meritless issues on appeal, for failing to raise issues regarding pretrial motions that had been abandoned, for failing to raise issues that were procedurally barred, or for failing to raise an issue regarding an improperly admitted photograph, as that particular error was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. He filed a motion for postconviction relief (PCR) under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851. The Brevard County Circuit Court (Florida) upheld the inmate's conviction but granted him a new penalty phase. The inmate appealed and petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. Appellee State cross-appealed, challenging the order granting the inmate a new penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate robbed and murdered a man. The high court held that his newly discovered evidence claim failed, as the recantations of three of the State's witnesses did not create a reasonable probability of acquittal on retrial. His claim of a Brady violation failed, as he did not prove materiality. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to obtain a file from his predecessor, impeach a witness, or challenge a juror. The trial court properly denied relief with regard to dog tracking evidence. Fla. R. Bar 4-3.5(d)(4), which barred defense counsel from interviewing jurors, was constitutional. Summary denial of the inmate's claims of juror misconduct and counsel's failure to challenge cross-race identification was proper. As his New York youthful offender robbery adjudication was not a conviction, it did not satisfy the &quot;prior violent felony conviction aggravator,&quot; &sect; 921.141(5)(b), Fla. Stat. (1987). Counsel's ineffectiveness in not discovering this entitled the inmate to a new penalty phase. As to his habeas petition, a proportionality reevaluation was not warranted; lethal injection was not cruel and unusual punishment; and his claim of incompetency to be executed was not ripe.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court affirmed the trial court's order upholding the inmate's first-degree murder conviction and granting a new penalty phase. It denied the inmate's petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant raised two issues on appeal: that trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance (U.S. Const. amend.

Counsel was not ineffective for failing to investigate and present a voluntary intoxication defense. None of the evidence established appellant was intoxicated at the time of the murder, and the testimony of a detective established that he was not intoxicated just a few hours before the murder. Counsel was also not ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence of appellant's history of alcohol abuse and dependency in support of the impaired capacity mitigator. Neither appellant nor his family indicated to counsel that appellant had a substance abuse problem or that he had been drinking at the time of the shooting. The trial court did not err in summarily denying appellant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to object to the introduction of gruesome photographs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented was whether the trial court properly denied reappointment of collateral counsel for the inmate to resume postconviction proceedings after the inmate had discharged his original collateral counsel and dismissed his postconviction proceedings more than two and a half years prior to his motion.

After waiving counsel, the inmate had sought a dismissal of the postconviction proceedings, fully aware of the fact that doing so would result in a waiver of any legal barriers to the State's ability to carry out the death sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to commit petitioner offender as a sexually violent predator under the Jimmy Ryce Act. The trial court granted the petition; petitioner appealed. The Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) denied relief, but certified this question: could one not in custody on January 1, 1999, be committed under the Act if he was sentenced to total confinement after January 1, 1999, but the qualifying conviction occurred before that date?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1976, petitioner was convicted of two counts of rape and imprisoned; he was released in 1993. In 2004, he was sentenced to three years for burglary; no sexual offense was involved in that charge. The State then moved to civilly commit him under Florida's Jimmy Ryce Act, &sect;&sect; 394.910-.931, Fla. Stat. (2004). The trial court ruled that one incarcerated after the effective date of the Act (January 1, 1999) for an offense not defined as a sexually violent offense, but who had been convicted previously of a sexually violent offense and had been released at the end of his sentence before January 1, 1999, was subject to civil commitment under the Act. Petitioner sought a writ of prohibition. The intermediate appellate court ruled that a person was subject to the Act whatever the reason for his or her qualifying confinement. The high court rejected petitioner's argument that to be subject to the Act his current conviction had to be for a sexual offense. Under its plain language, the Act applied to all persons who were then incarcerated--regardless of the nature of the crime for which they were imprisoned--and who at some point in the past had been convicted of a sexually violent offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court answered the certified question in the affirmative, lifted the stay on petitioner's commitment proceedings in the trial court, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A federal district court agreed with appellee bankruptcy trustee that a farm deeded in trust was owned by appellant beneficiary/debtor in fee simple. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Eleventh Circuit certified these questions: (1) whether under former &sect; 689.07(1), Fla. Stat., a deed to a trustee of an unrecorded trust conveyed only legal title to the property to the grantee as trustee; (2) whether an amendment to &sect; 689.07(1) applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grantors recorded a deed to a trustee of a trust identified in the deed by name and date; the deed referred to the unrecorded trust agreement, the settlors, and beneficiaries. The beneficiary/debtor, who was also the trustee of the trust, filed bankruptcy. The district court held that under &sect; 689.07(1) (2001), the deed conveyed fee simple title to the beneficiary/debtor individually, rather than conveying mere legal title to him in his capacity as trustee of the trust. Then, &sect; 689.07 was amended to provide that language in a deed identifying the trust by either name or date would cause a conveyance to be in trust; the amendment applied retroactively. On a second appeal from the bankruptcy court, the district court held that the deed did not reflect a &quot;contrary intention&quot; of the grantors to convey the property in trust, and that retroactive application of the amendment would be unconstitutional. The state's high court held that as the deed clearly expressed that the grantors intended to deed their farm to the beneficiary/debtor in trust, the deed fell under the &quot;contrary intention&quot; exception in former &sect; 689.07(1); thus, the beneficiary/debtor held mere legal title as trustee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court answered the first certified question in the affirmative. Under former &sect; 689.07(1), Fla. Stat. (2001), the deed conveyed mere legal title to the beneficiary/debtor as trustee grantee. Having answered this first question, it declined to answer the second certified question as it was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, an attorney and her law firm, obtained a lien and final judgment against respondent former client, who had waived his homestead exemption in a retainer agreement. The Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) held that the client's waiver of the homestead exemption of Art. X, &sect; 4(a), Fla. Const. was invalid. On appeal, the court considered the certified question of whether the exemption from forced sale of a homestead could be waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that in previous decisions, it had held that a waiver of the homestead exemption in an unsecured agreement was unenforceable. It declined to depart from that precedent. A 1985 amendment replacing the phrase &quot;the head of a family&quot; with &quot;a natural person&quot; did not change the purpose of the exemption from one protecting the family into a personal right that could be waived. As for the attorney's argument that the court's position conflicted with the law in other states, given the variety of state homestead provisions, comparisons to other jurisdictions were difficult and generally of limited value. Furthermore, the court's review did not reveal a shift toward permitting a waiver of the homestead or personal property exemptions in an executory contract. Finally, the court's previous decisions did not contradict the trend toward allowing waivers of constitutional rights, but were consistent with holdings that such waivers had to be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Waivers of the homestead exemption could be accomplished by mortgage, sale, or gift under Art. X, &sect; 4(c), Fla. Const.; it was a general waiver in an otherwise unsecured instrument that was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a second remand for resentencing, the Pinellas County Circuit Court (Florida) sentenced defendant to death,  finding two aggravating factors, one statutory mitigating factor, and three nonstatutory mitigating factors. Defendant again appealed, raising claims relating to the exclusion of evidence, improper remarks by the State during the penalty phase, the weight given to the mitigating factors, and to the sentence itself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a review of defendant's claims and the evidence, his death sentence was again upheld. First, the relevant case law supported the exclusion of proffered expert testimony regarding Florida's parole procedures and defendant's likelihood of being paroled. Second, the alleged excluded testimony regarding the circumstances of the murder was presented to the jury, with the exception of testimony that was not proffered. Thus, absent a proffer, a claim regarding the testimony was denied. Third, neither the mercy comments, &quot;golden rule&quot; arguments, nor the State's denigration of defendant's mitigation strategy amounted to reversible or fundamental error which denied defendant a fair penalty hearing. Fourth, the trial judge's rejection of two of defendant's proposed mitigating factors was supported by competent, substantial evidence. Moreover, the assignments of weight to the established mitigating factors did not appear unreasonable or arbitrary. Fifth, given the totality of the evidence, the sentence was proportionate. And, finally, as the instant court has previously rejected claims that Florida's capital sentencing scheme is unconstitutional, no relief was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appeals from the Circuit Court in and for Monroe County (Florida), appellant sought review of the denial of his motion for postconviction relief under Fla.

Finally, he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that appellant's claims with regard to his failure to receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing at the postconviction stage were without merit. With regard to the questioning by the trial court, there was no bias displayed by the trial court in favor of either the State or appellant, and the trial court elicited information that was clearly helpful to him, including information relating to defense counsel's investigation of an alibi defense. The trial court did not err in the partial denial of a Rule 3.853 motion which requested DNA testing of hairs attached to tape used to bind a victim. Evidence that the hairs came from someone other than appellant or the victims would fail to prove or disprove any theory in the case because it was impossible to establish when or how the hairs could have become attached to the tape. As to the habeas corpus claim, appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to present on appeal the improper denial of a motion to change venue, as the pre-trial publicity was factual rather than inflammatory, and most of the prospective jurors assured the trial court that they could be impartial despite any extrinsic knowledge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both the trial court's denial of appellant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 motion for postconviction relief and the denial of his second Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.853 motion for postconviction DNA testing were affirmed. His petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held the strategic choice to use lay testimony on good aspects of defendant's life, rather than contradictory expert testimony, was not ineffective.

Defendant did not show he was ineffectively advised to plead guilty, as he did not show he would have insisted on a trial, or that his pleas were involuntary, nor did he show a defense to the charges would succeed. Counsel was deficient for not attending depositions and pleading defendant guilty to armed kidnapping, but no prejudice was shown. Counsel's representation of defendant's codefendant in a burglary used as an aggravator against defendant created no conflict of interest. Defendant was not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because (1) appellate counsel's ineffectiveness was not shown, and (2) instructions on the heinous, atrocious, or cruel, pecuniary gain, &quot;in the course of a felony&quot; or &quot;victim under 12 years of age&quot; aggravators were not improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's girlfriend broke up with him, defendant repeatedly harassed her. The girlfriend's husband and one daughter were later found murdered, and blood on defendant's clothing matched that of the husband. The murdered daughter was found hidden in a cottage behind defendant's house. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted and a sentence of death and of life imprisonment was imposed. Those decisions were affirmed on appeal. Defendant filed his PCR motion, which was denied after an evidentiary hearing on just the ineffective assistance of counsel claims. On appeal, the court found no ineffectiveness of counsel on multiple issues raised by defendant during the guilt and penalty phases of the trial. A claim under Crawford was not preserved for review, and a claim that the trial court engaged in ex parte communications was not supported by the evidence and was procedurally barred. Defendant had an opportunity to raise a claim regarding mental retardation under Fla. R. Crim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and others intended to commit a home invasion robbery on a purported drug dealer, but the victim abandoned them. The victim was jumped and beaten when he arrived at defendant's girlfriend's apartment. Defendant then fired multiple shots at point-blank range into the victim's head. Defendant was initially deemed not competent to stand trial on two occasions, and after hospitalization, the trial court deemed him competent based on the opinions of two out of three expert witnesses. He was convicted, based in part on testimony from two accomplices, and his convictions and sentence were affirmed on appeal. The trial court denied his PCR motion. On appeal, the court found that as defendant was deemed competent to stand trial under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.211(a), there was nothing unconstitutional about applying the death penalty. As defendant's physical impairment was not raised earlier, it was procedurally barred. However, such a claim lacked merit. Defendant failed to show ineffectiveness of his trial or appellate counsel on a number of issues. Claims under Ring and Apprendi were inapplicable based on the prior-conviction exception and procedurally barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of an order from the Circuit Court in and for Santa Rosa County (Florida), which denied his motion under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 18-year-old inmate went with the inmate and the co-defendant into the woods, where they drank alcoholic beverages, had sex with her, and then fatally shot her. Thereafter, they cut her body, took photos, and buried her. The inmate eventually confessed, and he was convicted and sentenced to death. His direct appeal resulted in an affirmance, and his postconviction relief motion was denied. On appeal, the court held that the inmate failed to show that his plea was not voluntarily entered due to his lack of competency. It was noted that he had been found competent by two experts prior to his trial. The inmate's claim of ineffectiveness of trial counsel during the guilt phase failed, as the evidence did not support his claim that his counsel failed to adequately advise him of an available defense, and counsel's decision not to seek suppression was a strategic one. Claims of ineffectiveness during the penalty phase failed, as they were based on tactical decisions and there was no cause for counsel to have requested a competency evaluation at that time. There were no cumulative errors, and claims raised in the habeas corpus matter were procedurally barred or previously denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order which denied the inmate's postconviction relief motion, and the court also denied the inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a death row inmate and other such inmates, filed an all writs petition which challenged the constitutionality of Florida's lethal injection (LI) procedures under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Art. I, &sect; 17, Fla. Const. The named inmate appealed from an order of a circuit court (Florida), which denied his challenge to the LI procedure as well as other claims arising from his criminal matter. The court heard both matters together.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's direct appeal from his conviction and sentence, and his postconviction relief motions, were denied. After another inmate's execution by LI took an unusually long time, the all writs petition was filed. An investigation led to revisions by the Department of Corrections in its LI procedures, and the trial court thereafter denied the inmate's constitutional challenge in a previously pending matter. On appeal of that ruling and pursuant to the all writs petition, the court found that the inmate was not denied a full and fair hearing, as he was given ample time to raise issues regarding the other inmate's execution and the revised LI procedures. Although the trial court erred in excluding two memoranda, as neither was privileged under &sect; 119.071(d)1, Fla. Stat. (2006), and any privilege was waived, the court indicated that it would consider them in ruling on the LI issue. The court noted that based on the chemicals used, the training and certification, and the assessment of consciousness, the LI method of execution based on the revised procedure was not constitutionally violative. The inmate did not show a substantial, foreseeable, or unnecessary risk of pain in the process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court order that denied the inmate's requested relief, and it denied the all writs petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of first-degree murder and other crimes and was sentenced to death.  His second motion for postconviction relief alleged (1) execution by lethal injection violated the Eighth Amendment, and (2) newly discovered evidence about his brain impairment made his death sentence constitutionally unreliable. Appellee State opposed the motion, and the Brevard County Circuit Court (Florida) denied it. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate kidnapped, sexually battered, and murdered an 11-year-old boy. The high court held that as the inmate's Eighth Amendment claim was based on facts that occurred during a recent lethal injection in which complications arose, the claim was not, as the State argued, procedurally barred. After that execution, the high court had ordered a lower court to determine the validity of execution by lethal injection. The postconviction court erred in not taking judicial notice of that case under &sect; 90.202(6), Fla. Stat. (2006), but the error was harmless, because it considered all of the evidence presented in that case when reviewing the Eighth Amendment challenge. In view of the amended protocols adopted for administering lethal injections, this method of execution did not violate the Eighth Amendment. The inmate's claim of newly discovered evidence regarding his neurological impairment was procedurally barred, as he could have, but did not, present evidence of his alleged brain damage in his initial postconviction proceeding. Further, new research studies were not &quot;newly discovered evidence,&quot; and they did not support his claim that brain damage caused him to commit the crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had pled no contest, appealed the denial of his motion to vacate his conviction of first-degree murder and sentence of death filed under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed the 84-year-old victim and then stole his money, wallet, keys, and car. Defendant's motion to suppress a statement to police and evidence obtained during his arrest was denied. Defendant pled no contest over counsel's objections. The record reflects counsel was not deficient by failing to file a motion to withdraw the guilty plea based on a strategic decision. When counsel noticed defendant's changed mental state, they immediately advised the court and medical assistance was provided. Because a statement made by the judge would not have led a reasonable person to believe he or she would not receive a fair trial, counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to disqualify the judge. The record supported the court's findings that counsel adequately investigated and prepared mitigating evidence for the penalty phase. The testimony that was presented at the postconviction hearing was cumulative to and corroborated the evidence that was presented at the penalty phase, and the fact that there were other witnesses available who could have testified concerning defendant's upbringing and his mental health did not demonstrate that counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

The intermediate appellate court reversed its prior ruling, finding that its application of &sect; 924.34, Fla. Stat. (2001), was contrary to the right to a jury trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a prison escapee, was a passenger in a car that was fleeing police.

Under &sect; 924.34, it directed entry of judgment on the lesser-included offense of third-degree murder, as the underlying crime supporting this charge was harboring an escapee, defendant was a perpetrator of that crime, and thus a principal in a homicide committed to further a common criminal plan. In reversing itself, it held that &sect; 924.34 violated the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under Apprendi and Blakely to the extent it was read as allowing an appellate court, not a jury, to make a finding as to an element of the offense. The high court agreed. In convicting defendant of depraved mind second-degree murder, the jury had not found that he committed a felony, an essential element of third-degree murder. But if all of the elements of a lesser offense had been determined by the jury, appellate courts could properly direct a judgment for that offense under &sect; 924.34.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The case was remanded to the trial court for resolution by a jury of the issue of whether defendant was guilty of third-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the denial of his remaining postconviction claims, but upon review, the instant court found that such were properly denied.

Additionally, the New York case file contained some potentially mitigating information and could have been used to clear up the confusion over whether defendant was convicted of armed robbery or simple robbery. Finally, defendant was not entitled to habeas relief, as: (1) he could not use his petition as an additional appeal of issues that could have been or were raised on appeal or in other postconviction motions; (2) he failed to support his claim for an additional proportionality review of his sentence with newly discovered evidence; (3) death by lethal injection did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment; and (4) his claim of incompetency at the time of execution was unripe.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court in and for Orange County (Florida) sentenced defendant death for both murders and a consecutive 15 years for robbery and 60 days for the petit thefts. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court improperly restricted his presentation of evidence relevant to his relative culpability and what sentence he should receive. The supreme court found no abuse of discretion, noting that, inter alia, some of the evidence was presented through the testimony or videotaped depositions of the individuals with first-hand knowledge of the information. Defendant also argued that the trial court improperly found the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance (HAC), excluded mitigating evidence, and concluded that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating ones. The supreme court disagreed, noting that, inter alia, the HAC finding was supported by evidence that the strangled victims would have been conscious and aware of what was happening to them for at least one or two minutes, and that one victim was attacked in her own home by people she knew. The lack of criminal history factor was also considered, but discounted because defendant helped his brother with disposing of a body in another murder. Finally, the court declined to find the death sentenced disproportionate or the capital sentencing statute unconstitutional under Ring.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Santa Rosa County Circuit Court (Florida) entered a judgment that denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief in a case where defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder and sexual battery upon a person 12-years-old or older with the use of a deadly weapon, and defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed the denial of that motion and filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was seen with the victim early one morning. The victim's bookkeeper then could not locate the victim that same morning. Police searched defendant's house, but saw no signs of a struggle. That afternoon witnesses saw defendant in a store at the foot of a bridge. One witness saw his car parked on the bridge with the doors and the trunk open. The victim was soon found floating in a nearby bay. The victim had suffered blunt force trauma and 11 stab wounds to the chest. Evidence at defendant's residence tied him to the killing. He was tried and found guilty of first-degree murder and a sexual battery count. He told his attorneys not to present mitigating evidence. The trial court found he did so freely, knowingly, and voluntarily. Special counsel presented mitigation evidence. Defendant was sentenced to death; his convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. The state supreme court then found that no error occurred when the trial court denied his postconviction relief motion because defendant did not show a Brady violation, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, any other ground meriting relief, or that he was entitled to a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's denial of the motion for postconviction was affirmed, and the state supreme court denied his habeas corpus petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) affirmed the judgment of the Hillsborough County Circuit Court, and held that under &sect;&nbsp;800.04(6)(a)(2) and (b), Fla. Stat. (2001), a defendant's age was a sentencing enhancement, as opposed to an element of the crime, but certified a question relevant to the same as one of great public importance. Thus, the matter came before the instant court for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a review of the question presented, the instant court found that the age of a defendant was not a sentencing enhancement, but an element of the crime. Specifically, the age of a defendant under &sect; 800.04(6) was necessary to the provision criminalizing the conduct and ascribing the degree of the crime. It was therefore an element of second- and third-degree felony lewd or lascivious conduct. The State's contention that the age of the defendant was not an element in &sect; 800.04(6), Fla. Stat. (2001) failed to recognize the integral role the fact played in defining the crime. Further, unless a defendant who committed the crime of lewd or lascivious conduct was at least eighteen years old at the time of the offense, he could not be convicted of a second-degree felony. But, despite this, because defendant failed to object to preserve any error, he waived any claim to relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In answering the certified question, the age of a defendant was an element of the crime. But, the Second District's affirmance of the circuit court's judgment was approved, as defendant waived any claim for relief long before retrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect;&nbsp;627.702(1), Fla. Stat. (2004), the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) found petitioner insurer liable to respondent insured for the the face amount of the policy covering the insured's property, no matter what other facts are involved as to the cost of repairs or replacement. The insurer thus sought further review, and a question relative to the issue of their liability was certified as one of great public importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether &sect;&nbsp;627.702, Fla. Stat. (2004) required an insurer to pay the face amount of a policy to an owner of a building deemed a total loss when the building was damaged in part by a covered peril, but was significantly damaged by an excluded peril. On review, the insurer was not contesting the value of the property, but whether it was liable for the entire loss when the covered peril alone did not cause a total loss, but was only responsible for a relatively small amount of the damage. Contrary to the First District, the instant court held that the insurer was only liable for that part of a covered peril for which a premium was paid. Moreover, the instant court did not find that the plain language of the statute intended that if a covered peril caused part of a total loss, that the insurer was mandated to pay for the total loss.</SPAN></P>
