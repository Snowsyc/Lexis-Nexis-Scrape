IV rights were violated because the pen register application failed to clearly articulate the intended use, i.e., to track defendant's cell phone using an active cell site simulator, and police did not have the searched address as a possible location until the cell phone company provided that information; only after receiving that information and arresting defendant did the officers then apply for a search warrant.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 3-204(a)(1)), and first degree assault (Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 3-202), the trial judge erred in dismissing those charges.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 4-101(3); [2]-The PSC's denial of the utility's claim did not violate the Maryland Constitution or U.S. Const. amend.

Code Ann., Educ. &sect; 4-121 (2012 Supp.), letting the parents' children attend the neighboring district's schools. The trial court affirmed, and the parents sought further review.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed because, after the board entered into an agreement with another county to let its students attend the other county's schools, Md. Code Ann., Educ. &sect; 4-121(b) (2012 Supp.) did not give children living near the boundary of the other county an unlimited right to attend the other county's schools or require the county they lived in to continue to finance the resulting educational expenses, as Md. Code Ann., Educ. &sect; 4-121(c) (2012 Supp.) did not compel an agreement between the adjoining counties or give affected students and parents the right to enforce such an agreement but, instead, gave county education boards discretion to decide if they wanted to let students to attend an adjoining county's school. Concerns about driving distance and the ability to participate in after-school activities did not require a different conclusion because these were also faced by students in the parents' community who chose to attend the board's schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which convicted him of conspiracy to violate the authority line requirement of Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law &sect;&sect; 13-401 and 13-602(a)(9) (2003, 2010 Repl. Vol.). He was sentenced to a mostly-suspended term of imprisonment, followed by probation with conditions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant provided political consulting services and in furtherance thereof, he dictated the language for &quot;robocalls&quot; in an attempt to decrease certain voter turnout. The automated recorded message lacked an authority line. Several recipients of the calls became suspicious from the content, resulting in charges against defendant of violations of, inter alia, Md. Code Ann., Elec. Law &sect;&sect; 13-401, 13-602(a)(9), and 16-201(a)(6). At the close of the evidence, his motion for a judgment of acquittal was denied. Thereafter, defendant was convicted of only one charge, and he was sentenced. On appeal, the court found that defendant was clearly within the definition of &quot;person&quot; under Md. Ann. Code art. 1, &sect; 15 (2011 Repl. Vol.) and Md. R. 1-202(t). Due to defendant's role, he was not entitled to the anonymous speech protection under U.S. Const. amend. I. The verdict was not inconsistent, and the jury instructions were proper. The trial court's ruling on expert testimony was not an abuse of discretion under Md. R. 5-702 and 704. A probation condition prohibiting defendant from working in any election campaigns during the term of his probation was warranted.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, dismissed her petition; she appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant settled charges of improperly prescribing controlled substances by entering into a consent order (CO) with the Board in which she 1) admitted violating Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. &sect; 14-404 (2012 Cum. Supp.); 2) forfeited her state and federal registration numbers; 3) waived her rights to contest or appeal the CO; and 4) represented that she understood the CO's meaning and effect. Eight years later, she unsuccessfully requested the Board to revise the CO to allow her to reinstate her registrations so she could prescribe anesthesia drugs for hospital patients. The instant court held that the Board did not act arbitrarily and capriciously by holding her to her waiver of her right to contest the CO and declining her request for a revision. No state law or regulation entitled her to revision of the CO or to judicial review. Once she settled the charges through the CO, she was no longer &quot;aggrieved,&quot; and her case transformed from a contested case into a resolved case. The lower court properly found it lacked jurisdiction to grant mandamus based on her failure to show a clear legal right or protected interest in having her registration numbers reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner filed a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus and a petition for judicial review of a decision by appellee, the Commissioner of the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development (Department), revoking the owner's multiple-family dwelling license. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, denied the petition. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the Baltimore City Code did not provide for an appeal of the Commissioner's decision. The Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-101 et seq. (2009). imparted no right to judicial review. As the common law provided for judicial review, Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-302(a) did not apply. The appellate court had jurisdiction under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-301 (1998). Baltimore City, Md. Code art. 13, &sect; 5-15 was not void for vagueness. It allowed for revocation of a license if the owner allowed the prohibited activities, or failed to act to prevent such use of which it had actual or constructive knowledge. There was no due process violation because a Department employee conducted the hearing in the Commissioner's place. The notice of hearing did not indicate prejudgment. Substantial evidence supported the decision. There were 37 incidents in 20 months involving the manufacture, packaging, sale or storage of marijuana, cocaine and/or heroin on the property, and 10 incidents involving violence, murder and/or dangerous weapons. The owner did not significantly act to impede crime on its property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions on the ground that the Circuit Court for Frederick County (Maryland) erred in declining to ask defense counsel's requested voir dire question of whether all members of the venire panel were citizens of the United States because Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 8-103(a) (2006 Supp.) provided that only United States citizens were qualified to serve as jurors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of special appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to ask defendant's requested voir dire question. Because United States citizenship was a statutory qualification pursuant to &sect; 8-103(a)(3), defendant's question was a valid attempt to confirm that all members of the venire panel were qualified to serve as jurors. Defendant's requested voir dire question regarding citizenship directly related to one of the statutory qualifications of the venire panel pursuant to &sect; 8-103(a). The record reveals that the trial court was about to ask the simple question after assuring defense counsel that the question of citizenship was covered in the juror questionnaire. However, the prosecutor interjected with an objection, arguing that it would be improper for the trial court to pose the voir dire question, which led to distraction and the trial court's decision not to pose a potentially improper question. Not only was defendant's question proper, but if a defendant specifically requested a question regarding one of the jury's statutory qualifications set forth in &sect; 8-103(a), the question had to be asked by the trial judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of special appeals vacated the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The Prince George County Circuit Court (Maryland) dismissed the direct tort and constitutional claims and entered judgment for the county on the vicarious liability claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer shot the victim and decedent while they were in his home to deliver bed rails. The trial court dismissed the direct common law tort claims against the county on the ground of governmental immunity. After excluding evidence regarding the officer's mental health history and alleged prior violent acts, it granted the county summary judgment on the constitutional tort claim. After a trial, it granted judgment for the county on the vicarious liability claims, finding the employee was not acting within the scope of his employment. The appellate court held that as the county's alleged negligent hiring and retention of the officer were governmental acts, it was immune from those tort claims. Whether the officer acted to protect his home and family or was unprovoked, as he did not act out of a motive to protect the public, appellants' vicarious liability claims failed. The trial court properly excluded evidence of the officer's prior conduct and psychiatric evaluations on relevance grounds, as they occurred 10 years before the shootings. As the lack of this evidence prevented appellants from proving their constitutional tort claim, it was properly dismissed on summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, a trial court order preventing the defense from cross-examining a State's witness about her immigration status and the effect that a gun conviction would have had on that status violated defendant's confrontational rights. Finally, the trial court erred in overruling defendant's objection to the State's proposed &quot;anti-CSI&quot; jury instruction where defendant had sufficiently preserved the issue for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a convicted gun offender, was charged with failure to register in violation of the Baltimore City, Md., Gun Offender Registration Act (GORA).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">GORA required anyone convicted of a gun offense in the city to register with the city's police commissioner. The trial court dismissed the charge because the commissioner did not file regulations he enacted, as required by GORA, and GORA was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court held that the form used by the police department in conducting registrations and re-registrations was not a de facto regulation requiring formal issuance and filing under GORA. GORA was not unconstitutionally vague, as it set forth specific information a gun offender had to provide the police department, as well as any other information required by the commissioner's regulations, which, when enacted and filed, could be ascertained by a gun offender. As GORA's application only to those convicted of gun offenses in Baltimore City was rationally related to GORA's crime prevention purpose, it did not violate equal protection guarantees. The city council did not violate separation of power principles by giving the commissioner discretion to determine what additional information a gun offender had to provide when registering. State gun legislation did not preempt by implication local gun laws like GORA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant union filed a prohibited practice charge against appellee Montgomery County Executive (MCE) alleging Montgomery County, Md. Code &sect;&sect; 33-80(g) and 33-82(a)(8) violations. The Permanent Umpire (PU) found that the MCE committed a prohibited practice. The union appealed the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland grant of the MCE's writ of mandamus, denial of the union's summary judgment motion and reversal of the PU's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the Montgomery County Charter afforded the Montgomery County Council the authority to control the MCE's action or to limit the MCE's discretion by enacting laws specific to more general Charter provisions. The MCE had discretion as to his budget recommendations under Montgomery County, Md., Charter &sect; 303, except where constrained by Montgomery County, Md., Charter &sect; 510 and collective bargaining laws. The Council retained the ability to add or remove items from the proposed budget, including items in any CBA. The MCE was required to include funding to implement a CBA in his budget under Montgomery County, Md., Code &sect; 33-80(g). The MCE's failure to include funding for the union's 2011 CBA was a prohibited practice. The MCE's description of the arbitrated award, which was designed to sway the Council into disfavoring it, was a prohibited practice. Montgomery County, Md., Code &sect; 33-83 did not apply. The MCE's First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, claim failed. Assuming, arguendo, that the MCE's inclusion of funding to implement any CBA was legislative, the MCE was not entitled to immunity to avoid being called to account for a prohibited practice charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant union filed a prohibited practice charge against appellee county executive, alleging that he violated Montgomery County, Md., Code &sect; 33-109(a)(8) by failing to include sufficient funds to implement a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the county and the union. It challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which reversed the county labor relations administrator's (LRA) ruling in its favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LRA determined that the county executive committed a prohibited practice by failing to submit an impasse arbitrator's award as part of his proposed budget. The court of special appeals held that the LRA's decision was based on a correct interpretation of the law. Montgomery County, Md., Charter &sect; 303 required the county executive to include information required by law in the budget proposal. Montgomery County, Md., Charter &sect; 511 gave the council the authority to enact collective bargaining laws with arbitration and impasse procedures if it chose. Those laws were binding on the county executive as well as the employees to which they related. Under Montgomery County, Md., Code &sect; 33-108(f)(6), the county executive had to include in the budget any provision from the parties' final agreement that wold require action. The last, best, and final offers selected by the arbitrator constituted the parties' final agreement. The award affected the budget and required funding. Therefore, the award had to be included as part of the budget. Section 33-108(g) required the county executive to include any CBA and its funding in the proposed budget that is submitted to the council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a restaurant, a license transferee, and the Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City, sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City overruling the Liquor Board's transfer of a liquor license to the transferee. Appellee neighbors sought review of the trial court's judgment that the license was still active and that the Board could reconsider an earlier denial of the license transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant received a liquor license. However, it did not apply to renew the license before April 30th. The Liquor Board wrote the restaurant and informed it that the Board had not received the renewal application. The restaurant subsequently closed and vacated the premises. It then filed a Petition for Hardship Extension. The Liquor Board granted an extension of the life of the license for 180 days pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 2B, &sect; 10-504(d). The restaurant submitted a license renewal application. The appellate court held that the restaurant's license did not expire ten days after it left the premises because the Board accepted a hardship extension request within 180 days of its last day of active alcoholic beverages business. The liquor license was still active and therefore subject to transfer. Because the evidence before the Board was contradictory at best and certainly did not lead to a finding that a transferee of a liquor license was both a registered voter and a taxpayer, the Board's decision to grant the license transfer request was not supported by substantial evidence regarding the transferee's compliance with the requirements of Md. Ann. Code art. 2B, &sect; 9-101(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board's finding that the liquor license was &quot;live&quot; and subject to transfer was affirmed. The matter was remanded to the Board for further factfinding on the transferee's status as a taxpayer and the effect of the changes to Md. Ann. Code art. 2B, &sect; 9-101(c) on the application. Before the Board, the Neighbors were free to raise any constitutional and legal objections to the new statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant waived jury unanimity, defendant was convicted of first degree murder by an eleven-to-one vote and unanimously convicted of carrying a dangerous weapon openly with the intent to injure. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) sentenced defendant to life imprisonment, suspending all but twenty-five years for first degree murder and three concurrent years for carrying a dangerous weapon. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that his waiver of a unanimous verdict was neither competently nor intelligently rendered because he was misled by counsel's statement that if the jury were &quot;hung&quot; the State had the absolute right to try the case again and he was not informed by the court whether the 11 jurors were favoring conviction or acquittal. The appellate court disagreed, finding that defendant's dialogue with the court showed an understanding that an acquittal would not result in a retrial of the same charges. Defendant clearly understood that an acquittal would bar the State from retrying the case and his choice to waive the right to a unanimous verdict was based on his opposition to a lengthy delay prior to his retrial in the event of a hung jury. Defendant's claim that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that a State's witness was concerned for her safety lacked merit. The appellate court failed to find the testimony unduly prejudicial, as a limiting instruction was given. In addition, since defense counsel used the witness's testimonial inconsistencies to call into question her reliability, evidence explaining the inconsistencies was admissible to rehabilitate the witness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to assault in the second degree, Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 3-203 (2002, 2009 Suppl.) and was sentenced to three years of confinement, all suspended, and placed on probation. He challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which denied his motion under Md. R. 4-345 to correct his sentence as illegal, found him in violation of probation and reimposed his suspended sentence and probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the no-contact provision of his sentence was grounded on improper considerations and violated the statutory authority to impose probation on the conditions that the trial court considered proper under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 6-221(a) (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.). The court of special appeals held that the trial court's three-year prohibition on contact was not excessive, given the necessity to advance the State's compelling interest in securing the wife's safety from yet another incident of domestic violence at the hands of defendant. Given defendant's previous incident of domestic violence against his wife, the burden lay upon him to convince the trial court that the &quot;no contact&quot; provision would not advance the State's interest in protecting her. Defendant failed to present any evidence indicating that further violence would not occur if the channels of communication were opened between his wife and him. He argued that the sentence unconstitutionally impinged his rights to marriage. By perpetrating an act of domestic violence against his wife, defendant subordinated his rights to the State's interests in punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a coram nobis petition, contending his guilty plea was involuntarily as he was not advised of possible immigration consequences. The trial court denied the petition on grounds his deportation was a collateral consequence. He appealed; the intermediate appellate court affirmed. He sought further review. The Maryland Court of Appeals ordered the intermediate appellate court to reconsider its opinion in light of Denisyuk v. State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Padilla v. Kentucky, the U.S. Supreme Court held that counsel's failure to inform her client that his plea carried a risk of deportation was ineffective assistance under Strickland's performance prong. Denisyuk stated that Padilla applied retroactively, dating back to the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The instant court held that this statement in Denisyuk was unpersuasive dicta. Further, the instant court's prior decision was not controlled by either Padilla or Denisyuk because they both dealt with the right to the effective assistance of counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI and with Strickland's performance prong, whereas the coram nobis petition raised only appellant's claim that his guilty plea was involuntary; a finding of ineffective assistance would not compel a finding that the plea was involuntary. Thus, Padilla did not render denial of the coram nobis petition erroneous. Even assuming arguendo that Padilla applied to the instant case and was not &quot;new law&quot; that applied only prospectively, a Padilla-type analysis would not have been compelled by the precedent existing when appellant's conviction became final.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant servient owner (SO) appealed a summary judgment for appellees, a county and a limited liability company (LLC), entered by the Howard County Circuit Court, Maryland, in a declaratory judgment action ruling that a temporary easement had been converted into a perpetual easement under Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 6-101 (2010), that parol evidence would not be considered, and that the county had not constructively condemned the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that temporary in the deed was not ambiguous as it meant that the easement would last until a new access road was built. No parol evidence was needed. It was error to apply &sect; 6-101 as easements did not generate possibilities of reverter and rights of entry. The 1990 Option Agreement was not ambiguous, and a reasonable time requirement could not be added. Since a drive had not been closed, the Maryland State Highway Administration was not in violation of the option agreement. Further, the SO's claim were time-barred under Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 12-202 (1991). The easement continued as a temporary easement that was to become null and void when a second access road was constructed to the business park. The county did not commit an unconstitutional taking under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V. There had been no inverse condemnation. The easement had been voluntarily deeded to the county, and there could be no taking as long as the easement remained valid. The county's alleged intentions to maintain the road over the easement even after there was a second entrance was not a taking. The LLC did not have an easement by necessity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment was reversed. The case was remanded for the entry of a declaratory judgment that &sect; 6-101 did not apply to easements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a not guilty agreed statement of facts, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) convicted defendant of conspiracy to commit theft of property with a value of at least $1,000 and making a false statement when under arrest, under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect;&sect; 7-104 and 9-502. He appealed his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said an officer had no reasonable suspicion to stop the car he rode in. The appellate court held the stop was proper because the officer reasonably thought the car's headlamps emitted blue light, contrary to Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 22-203(b). Officers had probable cause to arrest defendant because (1) the car's passengers acted suspiciously, and (2) counterfeit credit cards found in the car could be attributed to him since he had access to them. He knowingly waived a jury because (1) any issue as to accepting the not guilty agreed statement of facts or complying with Md. R. 4-246(b) was unpreserved, since he did not object in the trial court, and he sought no plain error review, and (2) an advice of rights form and his exchange with the trial court showed he knew his rights. The trial court complied with Md. R. 4-246(b) by announcing its finding of a knowing waiver in the form of a leading question asking if the prosecutor thought defendant's plea was voluntary because this impliedly found the waiver was knowing. Any error was harmless because this way of announcing a knowing waiver did not change the case's result or affect the not guilty agreed statement of facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Wicomico Count (Maryland) of a variety of narcotics-related offenses, after his motion to suppress the fruits of a search was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police arrested defendant in a motel room pursuant to a parole retake warrant and found drugs and paraphernalia in two bags in the room. The appellate court held it was no error to deny his motion to suppress, if he had standing, because (1) the warrant let police enter the room, (2) police only had to have a reasonable suspicion that he, as a parolee, was engaged in criminal activity, and (3) they had such suspicion based on tips of drug selling at the motel and his customer's identification of him. An initial examination of the bags was within the scope of a search incident to lawful arrest because (1) he was lawfully arrested, (2) the search was contemporaneous with the arrest, and (3) it was not clear error to find the bags were within his Chimel perimeter. This did not justify a search of the bags after he was out of the room because the exigencies of such a search were absent. The plain view doctrine allowed the search because during the first search police saw drugs in plain view. If a bag 16 feet from defendant were not in his Chimel perimeter, a contrary holding was harmless because contraband found in a bag within his Chimel perimeter supported his convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless search of his desk. Defendant argued that the trial court's findings that the desk was located in a common area rather than a private office, the desk was not locked when searched, the drawers had general, non-personal labels insufficient to support a finding of no reasonable expectation of privacy. The appellate court found no error, concluding that defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the desk. Defendant was assigned the desk, that was owned by the school and located in a large, open, well-traversed room. Defendant could have taken steps to safeguard what he had in the desk, but did not. Defendant also argued that the trial court erroneously denied his motion for judgment of acquittal, because the State only presented evidence that he exchanged inappropriate letters of a non-sexual nature with the victim. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the trial court also relied on defendant's interactions with the victim and his notes and letters with sexual undertones fell within the ambit of Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 3-602(a)(4)(i) (2002).</SPAN></P>

Six months later, the driver filed another negligence action against the motorist, alleging the same facts that supported the earlier complaint. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) granted the motorist's motion to dismiss, finding the claim was time-barred by Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-101.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Alleging that he suffered bodily injury as a result of an automobile collision that occurred on April 4, 2005, the driver filed a complaint against the motorist on March 12, 2008. That complaint was timely filed, as limitations did not run until April 4, 2008. Thereafter, the driver entered a voluntary dismissal of the complaint on September 10, 2008, which was filed before the motorist filed an answer. The driver claimed Md. R. 2-506(a) permitted a refiling of the same claim, after dismissal. The driver essentially read into &sect; 5-101 the ability to construe his re-filed complaint as &quot;relating back&quot; to the first-filed complaint. While other jurisdictions had enacted relation back statutes that extended the time period for filing a complaint after an original complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice, Maryland had not done so. Neither &sect; 5-101 nor Rule 2-506 provided the driver with the ability to avoid the statute of limitations where he voluntarily dismissed his complaint and filed an identical claim, based on the same facts, more than three years after the accrual of the action. The second complaint had to be filed within the applicable limitations period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, tug company and docking master, sued appellees, the State, the Board of Pilots, the Association of Pilots, and several individual members of the Association. The trial court granted appellees' motion for judgment. The two claims remain were the company's assertion that the Association violated Maryland's Antitrust Act, and the docking master's claim that the Maryland Pilots Act infringed upon his right to contract freely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company asserted that the trial court erred in granting the Association's motion for judgment on its antitrust claim. The appellate court found no error, because the company did not prove that the Association's work rules unreasonably restrained competition. Second, the company argued that the trial court erred in permitting the Association to assert a statute of limitations defense at trial, thus limiting its claim for damages. The appellate court declined to address that contention because it decided against the company on its antitrust claim. As company conceded, the statute of limitations issue would only be relevant if the appellate court decided in its favor on the merits. The docking master contended that the trial court erred in granting the State's motion for judgment on his claim that docking masters should not be required to be members of the Association because it was an unconstitutional exercise of the State's police power. This contention was not been preserved for appellate review. Finally, the appellate court agreed with both appellants that the trial court erred by failing to issue a declaratory judgment as to their antitrust and constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded with instruction to enter written judgment declaring that the February 2009 rules of the Association of Maryland Pilots implementing the rotation system did not violate Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect; 11-204(a)(1) and the Pilots Act did not unlawfully restrain the docking master's right of freedom of contract. The judgment of the trial court was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant purported father filed an objection to the stepparent adoption by appellee stepfather, but did so beyond the time provided by the juvenile court's show cause order. The stepfather moved to strike the late objection, and the Circuit Court for Queen Anne's County (Maryland) granted the motion. The father appealed the denial of his motions to alter and amend judgment and to stay adoption proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had denied that he was the child's natural father. Since the mother and stepfather's marriage, the child had resided with both the mother and stepfather. The mother consented to the stepfather's adoption of the child. The appellate court held that Md. R. 9-107 did not differentiate between guardianships and adoptions, nor did it set forth different time limits for guardianships and adoptions The failure to timely object to an independent adoption had the same effect as failure to timely object to a guardianship and served as a statutory deemed consent under Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-3B-20. Further, There was no basis to conclude that the legislature intended that a deemed consent be revocable while a deemed consent to a guardianship is irrevocable. Thus, there was no right to revoke a statutorily deemed consent. The father was properly served with a show cause order, and had he timely objected, would have had the opportunity to establish paternity. Hence, establishing his paternity at an earlier point in the proceedings was not necessary in order for him to have standing to file a timely objection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees substitute trustees sued appellant mortgagor in the Circuit Court of Queen Anne's County (Maryland) to foreclose on a mortgage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagor said the substitute trustees did not meet certain requirements. The appellate court held his motion to dismiss on this basis was moot because the substitute trustees satisfied Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 7-105.1(d)(2) (Supp. 2011) and Md. R. 14-207(b) (2009 Supp.). His motion was untimely, under Md. R. 14-211 (2009 Supp.), because (1) it was not filed 15 days after service of an order to docket, and (2) no good cause for late filing was shown. The substitute trustees lawfully possessed a promissory note, despite its copy's lack of endorsements, because (1) a trustee was a person not in possession entitled to enforce it, under Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect; 3-309, (2) it was lost, and (3) the mortgagor paid its owner for three years before default. The substitute trustees' appointment was proper despite being executed by an attorney in fact without a power of attorney recorded in the land records because Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 4-107 did not apply. A deed of trust was not void for not naming an individual as trustee because a curative statute allowing an individual's appointment as substitute trustee applied retroactively, as it did not impair vested property rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hearing examiner held the employee's preexisting asymptomatic degenerative disc disease barred him from receiving line-of-duty disability benefits due to an injury incurred in the line of duty because his disability was not independent of a preexisting condition. The appellate court held this decision was error because (1) it misconstrued Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 22, &sect; 9(p)(11)(iv), requiring that an impairment be independent of any preexisting condition, (2) the mere existence of the preexisting condition did not disqualify the employee from line-of-duty disability benefits, although the percentage of the impairment due to the preexisting condition did not count when calculating the percentage threshold required to qualify for disability benefits, and (3) the hearing examiner otherwise found the employee suffered a 25 percent impairment to his back and 25 percent impairment to his right arm due to the line of duty injury, meeting the requirements of the statute. It was error for the trial court to award the employee benefits because this exceeded the court's authority, which required it to remand the matter with directions to grant the employee's claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of first-degree assault, robbery, false imprisonment, and the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, and, on appeal, the unlawful taking conviction was merged into the robbery conviction, he moved the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to Md. R. 4-345(a), arguing the other convictions merged. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tied up and assaulted the victim before taking her property. The appellate court held his sentences did not merge, for double jeopardy purposes, under the required evidence test, because the crimes were not the &quot;same offense,&quot; as (1) the first-degree assault required infliction or attempted infliction of serious bodily injury, which the others did not, (2) robbery required theft of property, which the others did not, and (3) false imprisonment required the victim's actual detention, which the others did not. The rule of lenity did not require merger because it did not apply, as each crime was a common law crime, so it could not be used to discern a non-existent legislative intent. The issue of merger under the &quot;fundamental fairness&quot; test was not considered because (1) it was not preserved, and (2) the procedural dispensation of Md. R. 4-345(a), allowing review of an unpreserved illegal sentence, did not apply to a non-merged sentence under such a fluid test dependant on a subjective evaluation of the evidence. If the fundamental fairness test applied, it did not require merger because the first-degree assault was not an incident of the robbery or the false imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's first trial ended in a mistrial, a second trial was held and a jury found him guilty of first degree murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony and crime of violence, and wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) sentenced him to life for the murder and a consecutive 20 years for use of a handgun, the first five without possibility of parole. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence portions of his statement made to police, because the detective's testimony amounted to hearsay within hearsay. The appellate court concluded that the statements were not hearsay, as they were not admitted as substantive proof of the statements, but for purposes of assessing credibility and that defendant was not prejudiced when similar testimony came in later. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in failing to disclose notes received from the jury, as the trial court failed to comply with Md. R. 4-326. By failing to object to either the procedure of asking questions submitted by the jury and by failing to object when the court asked the questions, defendant waived this issue. Waiver aside, the defendant as not prejudiced, as defendant was present when the questions were asked and the questions merely clarified a witness's prior testimony. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to sustain his convictions, where three eyewitnesses identified defendant and defendant's flight suggested the killing was deliberate, premeditated, and willful.</SPAN></P>

The Commission awarded benefits to the employee. Appellees, the employer and the employer's insurer, filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland). The court reversed the decision of the Commission to award benefits. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, who worked as a banquet houseman at a hotel, was setting up tables in the banquet hall at the hotel, when he became involved in a dispute with a coworker. The coworker became enraged and called a friend. The employee's supervisor told the employee to check out because his shift was about over. The employee did check out, put on his street clothes, got in his car, and drove away. The coworker followed the employee. When the employee stopped his car in an alley, the coworker's friend arrived in his vehicle and shot the employee, rendering him a paraplegic. On appeal, the court found that the employee's injuries were not covered by the Maryland Workers' Compensation Act, Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 9-101 et seq. (1999 Repl. Vol., 2007 Supp.), because the assault that caused them was not directed against the employee in the course of his employment. The employee's injuries did not qualify as an accidental injury as defined in Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 9-101(b)(1), and, even assuming that the injury arose out of his employment, the employee's injury did not occur in the course his employment under Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 9-101(b)(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a doctor and her employees, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) upholding a decision of appellee Maryland Board of Physicians, sanctioning the doctor for aiding an unauthorized person in the practice of medicine and unprofessional conduct, and the employees for practicing medicine without a license. The Board challenged the finding that certain sanctions were arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees worked for the doctor as a business manager and office receptionist. Neither employee was a licensed physician, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant. The employees were trained on a laser machine by a manufacturer's representative and certified competent to perform laser hair removal. After a patient complained about burns and scars resulting from ongoing exposure to the laser, the Board filed charges against appellants. On appeal, appellants argued, inter alia, that the Board erroneously relied on a declaratory ruling in concluding that laser hair removal was a surgical procedure and constituted the practice of medicine. The appellate court found no error, concluding that the Board properly treated the ruling as binding precedent. The Board's conclusion that laser hair removal was the practice of medicine was not erroneous, but was supported by a definition of an &quot;ablative surgical procedure&quot; as one designed to destroy or excise by use of a laser. Appellants' claim that they were not notified of the illegality of their conduct lacked merit, as it was not the Board's duty to notify every person performing laser hair removal their behavior might be unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's finding that the sanctions imposed by the Board were arbitrary and capricious was erroneous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged injured persons sought review of an order and confirmation of an out-of-city removal and transfer by the Circuit Court for Howard County. The issues were, inter alia, whether a removal and a transfer were justified on the basis of pervasive community prejudice, including widespread prejudicial publicity, and whether due process required the alleged injured persons to be heard in the transferor court as to a new venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 7-year-old injured person had his dirt bike confiscated and was arrested. Appellee police officers allegedly later arrested the mother in retaliation. After the filing of the lawsuit against the officers stirred up a new round of media attention, the officer moved for removal, arguing that there was a pervasive, protracted and totally one-sided portrayal of the facts as well as a hostile public reaction and protests, making it impossible for them to receive a fair trial in Baltimore. The reviewing court held the trial court correctly determined that removal from Baltimore City was justified under Md. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8 and Md. R. 2-505 as the publicity was pervasive, negative, continuing and prejudicial. The officers' actions spurred demonstrations, denunciations and demands for a City boycott, all duly reported in the media. High-ranking public officials, including their ultimate employer, the Mayor, criticized the officers' conduct; and community activists called for their ouster, sometimes in the most fiery of terms. There was no due process or equal protection violation in the transfer of the case.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Envir. &sect; 9-204(m) (Supp. 2010) was a &quot;special law,&quot; denied due process and equal protection, and caused an unlawful taking of property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Md. Code Ann., Envir. &sect; 9-204(m) (Supp. 2010) barred rubble landfills near certain waterways. The appellate court held it was not a &quot;special law,&quot; under Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 33, because (1) it applied to anyone wishing to establish a rubble landfill in the defined areas, (2) it did not only apply to the company's location, (3) it identified no particular entity &quot;in an equivalent manner,&quot; (4) it was not intended to burden the company alone, (5) no exceptions let a competitor do what was denied to the company, (6) its immediate effect on only the company did not make it a special law, (7) it had a rational basis by protecting natural areas, (8) its limited area did not make it arbitrary, as territorial uniformity was no constitutional prerequisite, and (9) general environmental laws did not make it a special law. If it were a special law, it was constitutional because it was tailored to new conditions. It did not violate due process or equal protection, under Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24, because it (1) had a rational basis, (2) applied a focused remedy to one phase of water pollution, and (3) was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) of the decision of the Baltimore County, Md., Board of Appeals denying approval of the developer's plan to further subdivide and develop certain real property. The trial court affirmed the decision, and the developer sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer said its plan was &quot;deemed approved,&quot; under Baltimore County, Md., Code &sect; 22-47 (1988/89 Supp.), when an agency did not timely act. The appellate court held this failed because (1) the issue was unpreserved, and (2) review under Baltimore County, Md., Code &sect; 22-61(a) and (c) (1988/89 Supp.) was not barred. The plan's conflict with a master plan supported disapproval because, under Baltimore County, Md., Code &sect; 26-166(a) (1988/89 Supp.) and Baltimore County, Md., Code &sect; 32-4-102(a)(1), the master plan was binding. Baltimore County, Md., Code &sect;&sect; 22-37 and 22-38 (1988/89 Supp.) did not &quot;deem&quot; compliance with the master plan because the review process considered master plan conflicts. A claim that Baltimore County, Md., Code &sect; 22-18 (1988/89 Supp.) required the county to buy the property, when the developer's plan conflicted with the master plan, failed because (1) the claim was not preserved, (2) the developer sought to amend an existing subdivision plan, and (3) it was not denied all beneficial use of the property. Substantial evidence supported denying the developer's plan because (1) current conditions were considered, and (2) the plan conflicted with the master plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee wanted to transfer his license to a new location. The appellate court held administrative mandamus was unavailable as to a transfer denial because Md. Ann. Code art. 2B, &sect; 16-101(a) allowed judicial review. Such relief was unavailable as to refusing to consider a transfer before the license expired, under Md. Ann. Code art. 2B, &sect; 10-206(a), because (1) the licensee had to meet new license requirements, under Md. Ann. Code art. 2B, &sect; 10-503(a)(2)(iv), and (2) he did not follow the board's governing rules, as no in-person presentation before the board triggered the transfer process, the application could not likely have been timely finalized, and the board had no clear legal duty to timely finalize it or consider it where he did not pay his debts. A certain board meeting transcript did not have to be considered because (1) it would not have changed the result, and (2) the record was sufficient without it. It was no error to docket the case as a judicial review petition and not an administrative mandamus action because (1) the petition was captioned as one for judicial review, (2) the procedure for the two actions was virtually identical, and (3) the filing was untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Circuit Court for Wicomico County (Maryland) affirmed the permanent revocation of appellant physician's medical license by the Maryland State Board of Physicians, the physician appealed, arguing the Board abused its discretion in failing to refer his case to the Maryland Professional Rehabilitation Program under Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. &sect; 14-401 (2007) and the Board's sanctioning was arbitrary and inconsistent with its prior actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board opened an investigation of the physician on a complaint received from a female patient, alleging the physician had touched her inappropriately. Thereafter, three other female patients leveled similar claims against the physician. The Board filed charges against the physician, alleging immoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, in violation of the Maryland Medical Practice Act, Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. &sect; 14-404(a) (1981, 2005 Repl. Vol., 2007 Supp.). The Board found by a preponderance of the evidence that the physician sexually assaulted the four female patients over a period of two years. The court noted that the physician failed to preserve either of his claims for appellate review but nevertheless addressed the claims. With respect to the Board's sanction of permanent revocation, although Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. &sect; 14-409 permitted reinstatement of the physician's license, the statute did not require the Board ever to reinstate the physician's license. With respect to the Rehabilitation Program, Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. &sect; 14-401(g) and (k) did not require the Board to direct every, or for that matter, any impaired physician to the Program.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over three and a half years after being pleading guilty to child abuse, defendant filed a motion seeking a judicial determination that he was not required to register as a sex offender. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) denied that relief. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of defendant's conviction, there was no statutory requirement that he register as a sex offender. Thereafter, the sex offender registration statutes were amended to give retroactive effect to the requirement. The issue before the appellate court was whether the trial court erred in ruling that the retroactivity clause contained in Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-702.1(c)(1)(iii) (2008, 2099 Cum. Supp.) required defendant to register as a child sex offender. The appellate court noted that the charging document did not confer on the trial court the power to issue a declaratory judgment. In defendant's criminal cause, the judgment of conviction had been final for many years, and defendant did not challenge that conviction in the instant proceeding. Under those circumstances, the appellate court held that Maryland law did not recognize the filing of a declaratory judgment action in a criminal cause, even if the object of the declaratory judgment action was to obtain a ruling concerning a collateral consequence of the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was vacated and the case was remanded to that court, without affirmance or reversal, with instructions to dismiss, without prejudice, defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer decided not to insure property in an area prone to hurricanes. The appellate court held this did not violate Md. Code Ann., Ins. &sect; 19-107 because (1) the insurer gave required notice, and (2) substantial statistical evidence based on computer models showing the likelihood that the area in question would be exposed to hurricanes showed the decision had an objective basis and was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The decision did not violate Md. Code Ann., Ins. &sect; 27-501(a) because (1) it involved no traditionally prohibited discriminatory practices, and (2) Md. Code Ann., Ins. &sect; 27-501(a)(2) did not apply, as the insurer made no distinction between classes of individuals within the affected geographic area. If the statute applied, it was satisfied because (1) the insurer offered predictive statistical data for 100,000 model years, (2) the insurer did not have to provide statistical data validating the probability of a catastrophic hurricane occurring in Maryland, as hurricanes could not be thus pinned down, and (3) the insurer did not have to provide statistical data showing its rating plan was insufficient to cover hurricane losses, as this was based on rejected dicta.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Tax-Prop. &sect;&sect; 14-836, 14-839, 14-840 (2007), and Md. R. 14-503(c), so the homeowner was served in accordance with Md. R. 2-122. The purchaser fully complied with Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole a victim's car and fatally shot another victim. The appellate court held contradictory answers to whether he wanted counsel when questioned did not bar questions, after his Miranda waiver, because (1) the questions asked if he understood his rights before discussing a crime, and (2) a detective was unsure if he understood the question. Statements after the detective falsely said their exchange was private were inadmissible because this contradicted a warning that what he said could be used against him, making his Miranda waiver invalid. A claim of plain error in instructing on second-degree felony murder, when both felony murder charges were based on the same crimes, was not reviewed because (1) any error was not prejudicial, as the first-degree felony murder conviction and sentence were uncontested, (2) a pattern instruction was given, and (3) another case explained the law. The evidence supported a felony theft conviction for stealing the car, without victim testimony, because (1) it let the jury find he stole the car, and (2) it showed the value was over $500, under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 7-103(a)(1) (Supp. 2010), as it was a one-year-old operable Ford Focus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were reversed, and the matter was remanded for a new trial at which defendant's inadmissible statements could only be used for impeachment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of one count of felony murder, four counts of first degree burglary, one count of robbery with a dangerous weapon, four counts of false imprisonment, and one count of first degree assault. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) sentenced defendant to incarceration for life, without parole, for felony murder, and to three concurrent life sentences, plus 35 years, for the remaining crimes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever, because the crimes were not sufficiently unique or so distinctive as to establish a modus operandi of a single perpetrator. The appellate court disagreed, finding that each incident involved the confrontational home invasion of an elderly woman living alone, accosted by a man described as Hispanic; the victims all resided in houses that were within walking distance from each other; the home invasions occurred on a weekday between Monday and Wednesday; all of the victims were &quot;hog-tied&quot; and gagged; items stolen from each victim were found in defendant's apartment; and DNA consistent with defendant's DNA was found in three incidents. As for defendant's merger arguments, the appellate court concluded that the trial court did not err in failing to merge certain offenses. As to the false imprisonment and robbery convictions, the appellate court found that defendant tied up and detained the victims after leaving the home and thus, monger than necessary to accomplish the intended robbery. As for the assault and robbery offenses, the appellate court concluded that the rule of lenity was not applicable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim filed the instant action after being shot several times. The Board denied the victim's claim after finding that his conduct contributed to his injuries, thus disqualifying him from an award under the Act. On appeal, the victim argued that the evidence did not show he was participating in a crime at the time he suffered his injuries and that any past conduct should not preclude his entitlement to an award. The victim contended that the Board improperly based its denial solely on an alleged &quot;continuing circumstance&quot; without citing to any specific behavior or conduct that would foreseeably lead to his injuries. While the appellate court agreed with the victim that his conduct had to be a proximate cause of an injury to preclude his entitlement to an award, it also concluded that the Board's decision to credit a detective's testimony, in which he recalled admissions by the victim about dealing in drugs and the occupational hazards of that conduct, was supported by substantial evidence. Although the victim denied dealing in drugs or engaging in a turf conflict with the assailant, and denied making any statements to the detective, the Board was free to reject his testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants large commercial utility customers sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) of orders of appellee Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) allowing an electric utility to recoup a shortfall caused by a price cap on other customers' rates by increasing appellants' rates. The trial court affirmed the PSC's orders, and appellants sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PSC capped standard offer service (SOS) rates for residential and small commercial customers. The appellate court held the PSC had no authority to cap SOS rates or approve the utility's recoupment plan because, in enacting Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 7-501 et seq. (2009 Supp.) and amending Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 7-510(c) (2009 Supp.), the legislature did not give it such authority. It was error to graft the allocation phase of traditional ratemaking onto the more abbreviated SOS oversight process because (1) traditional ratemaking involved a comprehensive proceeding, and, (2) unlike traditional ratemaking, the SOS costs were not &quot;allocated&quot; among members of a customer base but were shifted between customer bases. Under Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 7-505(b)(8) (2009 Supp.), Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 7-510(c)(3)(ii) (2009 Supp.) governed the PSC's authority over SOS rates after July 1, 2003 because a utility's obligation to provide SOS rates was continued when it was found there was not enough competitive electric service by that date, limiting the PSC's authority to regulate SOS to the standards in Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. Cos. &sect; 7-510(c) (2009 Supp).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to third degree sexual assault and was sentenced accordingly. Defendant withdrew his guilty plea, the State amended the charging document, and defendant pled guilty to child abuse. The Circuit Court for Calvert County (Maryland) denied defendant's motion to revise judgment based on mistake or irregularity, or in the alternative, petition for writ of error coram nobis. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant contended that the General Assembly violated the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the state and federal constitutions when it enacted a sentencing law and applied it retroactively, the dispositive issue before the appellate court was whether the trial court had authority or jurisdiction to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea and then permit him to enter a guilty plea to a lesser charge. The appellate court held that the trial court lacked the jurisdiction to vacate the earlier plea and conviction. Md. R. 4-242(g) provided for withdrawal of a guilty plea under three specific, limited sets of circumstances. The record indicated, and defendant acknowledged, that none of those three situations were implicated in the instant action. The appellate court further noted that, more importantly, defendant's motion was not filed within 10 days of the imposition of his sentence, as required by Rule 4-242(g). No provision of the Maryland Rules, and no motion by defendant, provided the trial court with the authority to allow defendant to withdraw his original plea and exchange it for a different plea. Therefore, the second plea proceedings were void for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was vacated. The case was remanded to the trial court with directions to vacate the guilty plea to child abuse and reinstate the guilty plea to third degree sexual assault and the original sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated matter, appellant building owner filed an appeal from two judgments from the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) regarding a decision by appellee commission for historical and architectural preservation (CHAP) to place the owner's building on the Special List. The circuit court affirmed CHAP's decision to place the building on the list and dismissed the owner's declaratory judgment action against CHAP and appellee city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued CHAP violated its due process rights by: (1) denying notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before placing the building on the Special List; (2) the Special List designation indefinitely burdened the property; and (3) the Special List provisions were inconsistent with Md. Ann. Code art. 66B, &sect; 2.12. The owner attempted to negotiate a resolution with CHAP. On February 28, 2008, CHAP sent a formal notice to the owner of a public hearing on March 11, 2008. The owner provided no evidence to support its claim that there would be no CHAP hearing as long as negotiations continued. The owner was given the opportunity to present evidence at the March 11, 2008 hearing but did not do so. CHAP did not enjoy &quot;limitless discretion&quot; with respect to Special List designation because Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 6, &sect;&sect; 4-1 through 4-4 and 4-7 offered opportunities for the owner to provide input. There was no inconsistency with Md. Ann. Code art. 66B, &sect; 2.12, Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 6, &sect; 3-3, and the urban renewal plan provision in Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 13, &sect; 2.5(b)(1). The appeals court did not address the merits of the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the attorney in fact appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney in fact's claims arose from (1) the insurer's settlement directly with the attorney in fact's principal, (2) Bar Counsel's admonishment against the attorney in fact's unauthorized practice of law, and (3) a trial court's refusal, under Md. R. 2-131, to consider pleadings the attorney in fact filed in a suit brought for the principal. The appellate court held the complaint was properly dismissed because the power of attorney only let the attorney in fact act for the principal to the extent the principal could act through an agent, and the law, under Md. Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. &sect; 10-601(a), did not let the principal practice law through an unauthorized agent. The attorney in fact's claim of a right to insist that the insurer deal exclusively with him failed because nothing showed his principal abandoned his right to act for himself. The attorney in fact had no standing to claim the principal's &quot;right&quot; to consult with the attorney in fact in settlement negotiations was violated because the power of attorney could not let the attorney in fact give the principal legal advice, so the insurer could not conspire to violate such rights.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held it was no error to deny his motion to suppress the fruits of this stop because, under the facts, police justifiably relied on the information even if inaccurate, as (1) they did not control those records, (2) the MVA had no interest in keeping inaccurate records, and (3) nothing showed enough errors in the mobile workstation computer database to make the information unreliable. It was unnecessary to remand the matter due to a U.S. Supreme Court decision issued while the case was pending on appeal, even though the search violated the Fourth Amendment, under that decision, because (1) applying the exclusionary rule would not result in appreciable deterrence, and, (2) in this case, it was proper to expand its good faith exception to include good faith reliance on appellate judicial decisions at the time of the search, as officers would believe, in good faith, they could search the passenger compartment of defendant's car after his arrest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of wearing, carrying and transporting a handgun on or about his person and carrying a concealed and dangerous weapon on or about his person. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) sentenced defendant to two years incarceration for carrying a handgun, and a concurrent sentence of two years for carrying a concealed dangerous weapon. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in the manner it conducted voir dire of the prospective jurors under Wright v. State, and asked the appellate court to recognize plain error. While the State conceded error, it argued that, absent an objection by defendant's counsel, the error did not amount to plain error requiring reversal. The appellate court agreed with the State, concluding that defendant's claim was not so compelling or extraordinary that it required review absent an objection at trial. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in responding to a jury note asking for a copy of the statute applicable to the count charging defendant with wearing, carrying and transporting a handgun by supplying the jury with a copy of the statute. The appellate court concluded that the trial court properly exercised its discretion and, alternatively, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, contrary to defendant's claim, the appellate court concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that defendant had knowledge of, as well as dominion and control over, the gun recovered under the passenger seat of the car he was driving.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff appealed the denial of the motion to dismiss as to all but the assault claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff reached her majority almost seven years prior to the filing of the instant action. Plaintiff alleged facts sufficient to constitute sexual abuse, that that abuse occurred while she was a minor, and that defendant was the abuser. On appeal, plaintiff contended that her action for damages for sexual abuse was timely filed under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-117 (2006). The issue before the appellate court was whether the General Assembly intended &sect; 5-117 to apply to the facts presented and, if so, was that application constitutional. The appellate court found that the extension of time from three years to seven years after majority, for the filing of claims for sexual abuse against a minor that were not barred prior to the extension, by their then applicable limitations, applied to plaintiff's action. The appellate court further concluded that the General Assembly did not infringe any vested or substantial right of defendant when it extended the period of limitations on claims of sexual abuse of minors and made that extension to claim that were not barred, as of the effective date of the new legislation, by expiration of the prior limitations period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to submitted the form to purchase a firearm, defendant sought the return of his firearms and a circuit court found that he was barred, under federal law, from possession a firearm because a prior emergency mental health evaluation in a domestic case constituted an involuntary commitment. On appeal, defendant contended that the evidence was legally insufficient to convict him of perjury or making a false statement as, in the earlier protective order case, the court erred in finding that he had been involuntarily committed to a mental institution. Defendant claimed that there was no evidence to show the required specific intent to lie on the form and that there was no evidence that clearly demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that there had been a false statement, as the only evidence that defendant had been committed was a seriously flawed court order. While it was found that the circuit court in the domestic case erred in finding that defendant had been involuntarily committed, that later finding did not change the fact that at the time the form was completed, defendant had been advised in the protective order case that his emergency evaluation constituted a commitment.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 3-203 (2005 Supp.), and retaliation for testimony, under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 9-303. His concurrent retaliation sentence was vacated, and, on remand, a sentence with a different commencement date was imposed without credit for certain pre-trial confinement. Defendant appealed this sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was not credited for time between his arrest and release from prison to jail after serving the assault sentence. The appellate court held the second retaliation sentence was consecutive because the trial court said (1) it began after he served the assault sentence, and (2) it would have been consecutive if he were in prison. The court could impose a consecutive sentence on remand because it could impose any sentence lawful under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 9-303(c)(1). He was entitled to credit from his arrest because (1) he was first given credit from that date, and, (2) under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-702(a) (2007 Supp.) and Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 6-218 (2007 Supp.), the court could not take away this credit. Alternatively, (1) Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 6-218 (2007 Supp.) was ambiguous because parts seemed to apply, while other parts seemed inapplicable, (2) on reconciling Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 6-218 (2007 Supp.) with Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-702(a) (2007 Supp.), the general assembly intended to give credit for time served on a prior sentence later vacated, and (3) the ambiguity had to be construed in defendant's favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents sought a visitation order after the parents ceased contact with the grandparents. The appellate court held it was error for the trial court to find exceptional circumstances existed allowing the court to substitute its judgment of the best interests of the children for that of the parents and order visitation as there was no evidence of harm to the children caused by the cessation or absence of visitation with the grandparents, and such an effect could not be presumed absent such evidence, particularly when the only evidence as to harm supported the parents' claim that the children were thriving, as the trial court could not draw an inference from the mere amount of time the children once spent with the grandparents and their generally loving and bonded relationship that the cessation of contact harmed the children. The visitation order had to be vacated because the grandparents did not meet their burden to show harm and facts from which the court could draw a reasonable inference of significant deleterious effect.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 18-325(b)(1) (2009), criminalizing behaving in a disorderly manner at a tuberculosis treatment facility, was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court held it was not vague because (1) it gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what it prohibited, as a common meaning of the phrase &quot;disorderly manner,&quot; interpreted in the context of a tuberculosis treatment facility, could be ascertained, and (2) it stated legally fixed standards for those whose had to enforce the penal laws. The evidence supported his convictions because, (1) as to refusing to comply with a placement order, while the order did not explicitly require him to wear a mask outside of his room, he knew his quarantine conditions and violated them by leaving his room without a mask, and, (2) as to behaving in a disorderly manner, the statute was violated by frustrating the ability of health care providers to give patients proper treatment, and defendant, by speaking to nurses in a profane manner and threatening them, interfered with their ability to give him proper care, as his conviction was based on his words and conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial judge committed plain error when he told the jury, without qualification, that a starter pistol is a firearm. Defendant contended that the trial court should have told the jury that a starter pistol could only be a &quot;firearm&quot; if it expelled, was designed to expel, or could readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive. The appellate court agreed, finding that a starter pistol could only be considered a &quot;firearm&quot; if it expelled, was designed to expel, or could readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive. The appellate court held that the trial judge should have told the jury that if they believed defendant's testimony that the weapon he displayed was a starter pistol, defendant should be acquitted of possession of a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a felony. Contrary to the State's claim, the appellate court further concluded that the error was indisputably material to defendant's rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint was dismissed under the law of the case doctrine because a prior similar complaint was dismissed based on a separation agreement waiving modification of its alimony provision. The appellate court held it was error to dismiss the husband's second complaint because the complaint was not barred by the doctrines of law of the case, collateral estoppel, or res judicata. The complaint was not barred by the law of the case doctrine because, after the first complaint was dismissed, a binding decision held alimony terminated upon a recipient's remarriage unless an agreement explicitly stated it survived the recipient's remarriage, which the parties' separation agreement did not. Collateral estoppel did not apply because the issue of termination of alimony based on Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 11-108 was decided after the husband's first complaint was dismissed. Res judicata did not apply because precluding the husband's claim would undermine the public policy in Md. Code Ann., Fam.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was assault while he slept in the Division of Corrections.

The issue on appeal was whether the inmate, who was the victim of a crime and lost an eye, was entitled to permanent partial disability benefits as a matter of law. The appellate court held that the Board erred in denying those benefits for the inmate. The inmate satisfied the statutory criteria in Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-810 (2008). While Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 9-627(d)(1)(vi) mandated that compensation be paid for 250 weeks for the loss of an eye, which would have resulted in an award of $ 89.750, the appellate court noted that Md.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought post-conviction relief in the Circuit Court for Harford County (Maryland) after pleading guilty plea to second-degree assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found defendant's plea was knowing and voluntary. The appellate court held he met the prejudice prong of the applicable test because the trial court found he would not have pled guilty had he been advised of his plea's immigration consequences. However, he did not meet the performance prong of that test because (1) the issue of plea voluntariness and effectiveness of counsel were indivisibly intertwined, so counsel's assistance in advising as to that plea could not have been ineffective in a Sixth Amendment sense, and (2) the immigration consequences were collateral, rather than direct, since the judge who took the plea did not impose them, so, despite Md. R. 4-242(e)'s requirement that he be advised of those consequences when pleading guilty, the Sixth Amendment did not require counsel to advise him of those consequences, as Md. R. 4-242(e) did not expand the national standard imposed by the Sixth Amendment, and Md. R. 4-242(e) itself provided that the failure to give such advice did not invalidate a plea. Therefore, it was error to find defendant's plea invalid because such a finding required that defendant satisfy both prongs of the applicable test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held a deed recorded on a certain date created no security interest for the bank because it had no legal description. The appellate court disagreed because the recordation did not determine if a security interest existed. The lack of a description did not invalidate the bank's interest because an equitable mortgage was established when the deed of trust was executed, since (1) the deed had the names of the grantor and grantee and the interest intended to be granted, and (2) it was executed and acknowledged on that date, all as required by Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 4-101(a) (2007), so it had all required attributes of a valid deed of trust, except a property description, and the parties intended an exhibit to provide that description, so the bank took its interest prior to, and free of, the contractor's mechanics' lien petition. If summary judgment was granted to the bank due to its &quot;re-recordation&quot; of the deed of trust before the mechanics' lien, that was error because its interest was not established by recordation before the mechanics' lien, as the deed of trust took priority no matter when it was recorded since it was effective as of the date of execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the appellate court was whether the Board's decision was legally sufficient to support its denial of the variance application. The appellate court concluded it was not. While the Board concluded that the owner failed to meet its burden of persuasion as to six of the variance criteria in Anne Arundel, Md., County Code &sect; 3-1-207, it did not explain why. Among other things, the Board failed to indicate what evidence it relied on to conclude that the proposed sizes of the houses would create additional impervious surface, which would negatively impact wildlife and plant habitats and result in a detriment to the water quality of a creek. The Board's conclusion that alternative plans would provide less disturbance was insufficient, as the Board did not identify what &quot;alternative plans&quot; it was referring to or explain how those plans, if implemented, would result in less disturbance to the area. The Board's finding that the proposed houses would alter the character of the neighborhood was inconsistent with its findings that, inter alia, the style of houses was consistent with the character of the neighborhood and many of the other single-family homes were in the buffer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a mayor and city council, challenged the entry of judgment by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) after a jury verdict in favor of appellee trustee in bankruptcy for a business owner who brought a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim against the city alleging that she was fired for engaging in protected speech.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city awarded the business owner's company a contract which entitled her to bid on auto body repairs required by the city. The business owner later appeared on a newscast and criticized the city's repair practices. The director of the mayor's office informed the business owner that her contract had been terminated. THe business owner attempted to impute retaliatory animus to the Board of Estimates through circumstantial evidence. However, the appellate court held that she did not present any evidence to show that the city solicitor or mayor were aware of the protected speech prior to their decision to fire her. There was no support for liability through evidence that showed that only one of the five Board members was aware of the memo when the Board voted to fire her. The inability to show that a majority of the members of the Board had knowledge of her speech precluded liability. The director of the mayor's office proposed that the Board terminate one contract only, in a move that was unrelated to the overall budgetary process. Thus, the trial court erred in dismissing him from the case on the basis of legislative immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed. The matter was remanded for entry of judgment in favor of the city.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a union and its members, sued appellees, a county, its executive, and its council members, in the Wicomico County Circuit Court (Maryland) for a declaration that a law enacted pursuant to a county charter amendment did not comply with the amendment. The trial court held the amendment unconstitutional and granted appellees' summary judgment motion, and appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment required the county council to enact legislation providing for binding arbitration with the county's sheriff's deputies. The appellate court held the amendment required the council to enact a law binding itself to arbitration with respect to the subject matter at issue and was unconstitutional. The amendment was a citizen initiative, rather than a referendum, because it required the county council to enact a law that it and the county executive would submit to binding arbitration, divesting the council of its discretion to reach an agreement with the deputies regarding salary terms and working conditions, rather than approving or disapproving legislation passed by the council. The amendment was unconstitutional because (1) it did not amend the form and structure of county government, which could legally be done by a citizen initiative, but was legislative in nature and usurped the county council's express legislative power, contrary to Md. Const. art. XI-A, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3, by requiring the council to legislate on personnel matters affecting a certain group, and (2) voters could not initiate local legislation since that was &quot;repugnant&quot; to Md.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee injured person was awarded damages based on a jury's determination that there was a pattern and practice of police misconduct and wrongful incarceration sanctioned by appellant county. The Circuit Court (Maryland) reduced the property damage award and one officer's punitive damage award and vacated the remaining punitive damage awards. It affirmed the remaining award. The county appealed arguing, inter alia, that statutory caps applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured person was charged with first-degree murder in the death of his wife after being interrogated for 38 hours with almost no sleep. He was incarcerated. Eight months later, he was released. Another man was charged with the crime. The injured person's lawyer sent a notice claim to the county executive. The jury awarded $ 5.2 million in compensatory damages against the county. In addition, punitive damages were assessed against certain officers. The appellate court held that good cause existed to excuse timely compliance with the notice as an ordinary prudent person could not have given notice by the 180th day. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that good cause existed to excuse any delay. At the time the action accrued, the caps did not apply to damages from his State constitutional claims. The attempt to justify retroactive application of the later legislation as &quot;remedial&quot; failed since what was at stake was a fully accrued cause of action for complete recovery for constitutional violations that were not previously subject to an assertion of either all or partial local government immunity.</SPAN></P>

I. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, dismissed the purchasing agent from the suit, and the jury returned a verdict for the city. The city and trustee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner appeared on newscasts and criticized the city's repair practices. Thereafter, the city terminated her contract, allegedly due to a conflict of interest arising from her husband's employment with the city. The owner filed bankruptcy; the trustee pursued her claim against the city. The city argued that the verdict against it on the &sect; 1983 claim had to be reversed, as there was no evidence that it had an official policy or custom of retaliating against vendors for their protected speech. The appellate court agreed. Appellee was able to establish only that one of the five members of the city's board of estimates of knew of the owner's protected speech before the board voted to fire her. As a jury could not infer retaliation from evidence that only suggested that it was a possibility, the &sect; 1983 claim against the city failed as a matter of law. The trial court erred in dismissing the purchasing agent from the case on the basis of legislative immunity. His voting to terminate the owner's contract was not substantively legislative because it did not involve a policy-making decision of a general scope; instead, it was executive or administrative in nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment against the city was reversed and the case was remanded for entry of judgment in favor of the city.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), sitting as a juvenile court, found appellant juveniles involved as to charges of assault in the first degree, assault in the second degree, conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree, disorderly conduct, and reckless endangerment, and committed them to the control of the Department of Juvenile Services and required them to complete 50 hours of community service.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to appellants' assignments of error, the appellate court found, inter alia, that the trial court did not commit reversible error in instructing the jury on the burden of proof with regard to self-defense; rather, it appeared that the trial court made a misstatement, followed by instructions on the proper burden. Even if the misstatement had been erroneous, it was harmless, as it was evident that no appellants sought to or could have prevailed on the defense of self-defense. The appellate court also found no error in the trial court's limiting cross-examination of a victim regarding a pending charge for distribution of cocaine, as the pending charge was not relevant and collateral. The evidence was sufficient to support appellants' convictions, as it showed, inter alia, that the &quot;whole back of the bus&quot; jumped on the victims; the victims were forced out of the bus and continued to be beaten, kicked, and stomped; and one of the victim's suffered serious injuries, including multiple fractures. The appellate court disagreed with appellants' contention that a custodial statements was inadmissible due to police inducement, finding no implied promise by the officer involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of his motion for a mistrial, defendant was convicted by the Circuit Court for Washington County (Maryland) of retaliation against a witness under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 9-303 (Supp. 2005), and was sentenced to seven and one-half years of imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that &sect; 9-303 was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The phrase &quot;threaten to harm another&quot; had a common and generally accepted meaning, such that persons of ordinary intelligence and experience were afforded a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited. The evidence supported the conviction. A detective had just testified in a trial of the mother of defendant's child and was told by defendant, on the courthouse steps, &quot;Now that you fucked with my family, I'll be fucking with yours.&quot; Defendant confirmed that his statement was intended as a threat. It was error to deny the motion for a mistrial as the prosecutor referred to a 2006 conviction, making an intentional statement despite the trial judge's instructions and rulings on the motions in limine. Although the trial court sustained defendant's objection, no curative instruction was requested or given. The prosecutor's act of informing the jury that defendant was a convicted criminal almost certainly had a substantial and irreversible impact upon the jurors, and might have been dispositive. Finally, the were-they-lying questions the prosecutor asked defendant were improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), which ordered him to pay alimony and child support to appellee wife. The husband had filed a complaint for limited divorce on the basis of a one-year voluntary separation. In turn, the wife counter-complained for an absolute divorce, or in the alternative, for a limited divorce, based on adultery and abandonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was ordered to pay $ 764 per month in child support and $ 1,500 per month to the wife as indefinite alimony. The court noted the unusual and hampering factual scenario before it. Namely, both parties were Spanish speaking and required interpreters and both were pro se in the proceeding. Of significance, neither party presented corroborating testimony from a witness and, therefore, neither proved legally sufficient grounds for a divorce. Further, neither party gave testimony, which if corroborated by witnesses, would have established the grounds for a divorce. So the court focused on the right of the wife to seek alimony, separate from a divorce. The court held that in the State of Maryland, a decree for alimony may be passed without the granting of a divorce, but in order to entitle a wife to such an allowance the facts in the case must be such as would entitle her to either a divorce a vinculo matrimonii or a mensa et thoro. Since the wife failed to prove her entitlement to a divorce, the award of alimony had to be vacated. Likewise, the court found there was insufficient evidence before the trial court to award child support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated both the alimony award and the child support award and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a handgun. The Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) sentenced defendant to three years of incarceration, with all but one year suspended, for violating Md. Code Ann., Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court infringed his constitutional right to keep, bear, and carry arms by ruling that he committed a crime. The appellate court disagreed, noting, inter alia, that there was no Maryland corollary of the federal constitutional right codified in the Second Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. II. In addition, even if the right to keep and bear arms in the home for the purpose of immediate self-defense were to apply to Maryland citizens, Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 4-203 (2002) did not infringe upon that right. The appellate court further noted that defendant did not cite a single cases to support his contention that civil penalties, rather than criminal penalties, were an appropriate response to a violation of the statute. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred when it failed to grant his motion to suppress evidence. The appellate court found that defendant waived any claim of error based on the Fourth Amendment by failing to raise the issue at the trial level. While defendant had made a Fifth Amendment claim at the trial level, his failure to raise the issue on appeal until his reply brief waived the issue for appellate purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Maryland State Police (MSP) denied the application by appellant gun permit applicant to renew his permit to carry, wear, or transport a handgun due to his conviction in the District of Columbia for possession of a dangerous weapon. The applicant appealed to appellee Handgun Permit Review Board which affirmed the denial of his permit application. The Circuit Court for Frederick County (Maryland) affirmed the denial. The applicant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The MSP argued that the applicant had been convicted of an offense that constituted a &quot;disqualifying crime&quot; as defined by Md. Code Ann., Pub. Safety &sect; 5-101(g)(3) (2003), and he was therefore ineligible under Md. Code Ann., Pub. Safety &sect; 5-133(b)(1) to possess a handgun based upon a recently issued Attorney General opinion. The MSP reasoned that the D.C. crime of possession of a dangerous weapon was equivalent to the Maryland crime of wearing or carrying a dangerous weapon, a misdemeanor which was punishable in Maryland by imprisonment of up to three years. The appellate court concluded that the Board did not err. The applicant had sufficient notice to provide him due process and negate any prejudice resulting from the failure of the MSP to advise him in writing of the reason it denied his application. Therefore, the error by the MSP as to the basis for denying the permit provided no basis for vacating the Board's decision. The Attorney General's opinion that the General Assembly intended for &sect; 5-101(g)(3) to be interpreted such that the conviction's potential punishment was measured by reference to the penalty under the law of Maryland for a comparable violation was correct.</SPAN></P>

The issue was, inter alia, whether there was substantial evidence that the company was required to register as a home builder under the Home Builders Registration Act (HBRA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LLC and its owners, who owned 30 lots in a subdivision, were charged with failing to register under HBRA, Md. Code Ann., Bus. Reg. &sect;&sect; 4.5-101 to 4.5-701 (2007 Supp.), unfair and deceptive trade practices under the Consumer Protection Act (CPA), Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect;&sect; 13-101 to 13-501 (2008 Supp.), and failure to comply with a settlement agreement pursuant to the CPA, &sect; 13-403(c)(1). The LLC was not registered as a home builder with the Home Builders Registration Unit (HBRU) prior to the owners' acquisition of the company when it contracted to sell homes. Under the terms of the consent Order, the HBRU agreed to renew a registration as home builder of another company owned by the owners provided they complied with certain conditions. The appellate court held the LLC acted as a homebuilder by agreeing to construct new homes for consumers despite its failure to register. By doing so, it was implicitly and falsely representing to consumers that it could lawfully construct new homes in violation of the CPA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessee sought review of a judgment entered by the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) in favor of appellee lessor, in the amount of $ 190,725.85 in damages and $ 21,977.95 in prejudgment interest. The lessee contended, inter alia, that the trial court should have dismissed the suit because it was barred by the applicable statute of limitations and it erred when it calculated the amount of damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The predecessor/lessor entered into an equipment lease with the lessee. The lessee defaulted and subsequently filed a chapter 11 petition bankruptcy. The parties entered into a stipulation and proposed consent order. The bankruptcy court executed the consent order. The lessor did not recover any portion of the unsecured claim by way of a distribution in the bankruptcy proceeding. The bankruptcy court dismissed the bankruptcy case without discharge of debts. The lessor filed suit for breach of the lease. The stipulation and consent order was not filed pursuant to one of the expressly enumerated sections in 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 349(b)(2). The appellate court interpreted &sect; 349(b) as vacating the stipulation and consent order, at least to the extent that it related to the transfer of title to the equipment and the granting of a security interest in it. Even if the court did not premise the damages award on noncompliance with the stipulation and consent order, but instead on breach of the lease, the appellate court could not determine whether the trial court erred in determining the amount as it did not explain its methodology or identify the components of the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was vacated. The matter was remanded so that the trial court could explain or modify its decision as to damages and prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>

Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 9-632(d) (2008), appellant widower sought the permanent disability benefits that might have been awarded to his deceased spouse had she not died before entry of an award. After the Maryland Workers' Compensation Commission denied his claim, he appealed. The Maryland trial court granted summary judgment to appellees, the spouse's former employer and its insurer. Appellant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The spouse died from causes unrelated to her work injury. About two weeks before her death, her temporary total disability benefits lapsed and she had not yet applied for an award of permanent disability benefits. The parties stipulated that appellant was not her &quot;dependent&quot; for purposes of &sect; 9-632(c), and that she had no surviving minor children. Appellant argued that she had a legal obligation to support him at the time of her death under the criminal non-support statute, Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 10-201; therefore, he was entitled receive her benefits. The appellate court agreed. Under &sect; 9-632(d), a deceased worker's right to permanent partial disability benefits survived to his or her spouse unless the surviving spouse had agreed to or had been adjudicated to have given up his or her right of support. Therefore, appellant's claim was not defeated by the death of his spouse. As the proceeding before the trial court was an &quot;unadorned administrative appeal,&quot; there were no factual disputes, neither party elected to submit issues to a jury, and both parties relied exclusively on the record developed before the Commission, a remand for a trial was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

Appellee had challenged his termination to the OAH.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee had asserted that his termination was unconstitutional because it was based on his political affiliation and, therefore, was in violation of his rights under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. Appellee acknowledged that he was employed under a former governor in state government patronage jobs. At the time of his termination, he was working as an emergency response manager. He acknowledged that he lacked any experience, training, or a degree. Appellant's secretary testified that she terminated appellee due to his lack of qualifications. The ALJ determined that appellant's Secretary had known nothing of appellee's qualifications before terminating him from his employment and that he was unconstitutionally discharged for a purely political motive based upon the negative press coverage about him. The court found that the ALJ's finding that appellee was unconstitutionally discharged for political reasons was unsupported by the evidence. The court held appellee's evidence did not satisfy the Elrod-Branti test, requiring a political motive for the termination, since an absence of the appropriate job qualifications was a permissible constitutional basis for termination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the ALJ erred by concluding that appellee was unconstitutionally terminated from his state employment and reversed the trial court's judgment affirming that decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant dairy farmer sought a declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Frederick County (Maryland) to confirm that a proposed contract for cattle syndication and agistment services did not violate Maryland laws governing the sale of raw milk. He also argued that a regulation that had been promulgated by appellee Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was unenforceable. The trial court ruled against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The farmer wished to offer agistment services to people who might want to own a fractional interest in a herd of dairy cattle so that they could drink raw milk, which in Maryland, was illegal to sell to consumers under Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 21-434 (1982). It was not illegal for an owner of cows to drink the raw milk those cows produced. The farmer would board and care for the cows and then provide the raw milk produced by those cows to the owners of the herd in accordance with their percentages of ownership. The appellate court agreed that it was not illegal for the owner of a dairy cow to drink the raw milk which that cow produced. It was not illegal to sell a fractional interest in a herd of dairy cattle. It was not illegal for an agister to provide agistment services by boarding and caring for dairy cows owned by others. Nevertheless, the transactions proposed by the farmer was a transaction within the scope of the Department's regulatory purview. Accordingly, the amendment to Md. Code Regs. 10.15.06.06(F)(1) was a permissible exercise of the Department's authority to regulate transactions involving the distribution of milk.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed except as to its determination that the count challenging the delegation of legislative power as unconstitutional was not moot.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Uninsured Workers' Fund (Fund) appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) that granted summary judgment to an injured workers' statutory employer and appellee Injured Workers' Insurance Fund (IWIF); the Fund claimed, inter alia, that the benefits awarded to an injured worker were the obligation of the statutory employer under Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 9-508.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee suffered a compensable injury during the course of his employment as a hazardous waste removal technician, and was awarded workers' compensation benefits. Because his statutory employer was not deemed liable for payment of the award, his direct employer, who was uninsured for workers' compensation in Maryland, was ordered (along with the Fund) to pay the benefits. The Circuit Court denied the Fund's motion for summary judgment and granted the statutory employer's cross-motion for summary judgment without a hearing. The appellate court found, inter alia, that a principal contractor/subcontractor relationship existed between the statutory employer and the direct employer. Although the employee performed a portion of his work for the direct employer in the District of Columbia, he concurrently worked for the direct employer on other work sites in Maryland. As a result, the employee was a covered employee under Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 9-203(a). Therefore, the Workers' Compensation Commission and the circuit court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the statutory employer was not liable for compensation under Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 9-508.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions to grant the Fund's motion for summary judgment, to deny the IWIF's motion for summary judgment, and to instruct the Workers' Compensation Commission to enter an order in favor of the Fund.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and three guests at the apartment were placed in flex cuffs.

When one of the officers walked from the bedroom of the apartment into the living room, holding the plastic bag of crack cocaine, and announced to the other members of the police team that everyone was going to be arrested, defendant twice exclaimed, &quot;It is all mine.&quot; Defendant contended that the inculpatory exclamation should have been excluded from the evidence because it was made in response to the functional equivalent of interrogation, to which he was subjected by the police without the benefit of his Miranda warnings in violation of the Fifth Amendment. On appeal, the court found that the exclamation by defendant was admissible. The announcement by the officer was not something either calculated to or likely to provoke an incriminating response. Thus, it did not qualify as an interrogation for purposes of a Miranda warning having been required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants parents sued appellee pool company in the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County (Maryland) for negligence causing their son's death. The trial court granted summary judgment removing the issue of whether the son suffered conscious pain and suffering prior to his death from the jury's consideration. After the jury found in favor of the parents, the trial court denied their motion to alter or amend the judgment, and they appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son was found unconscious in a pool and died without regaining consciousness. The appellate court held it was error to grant summary judgment for the company as to a claim for recompense for his conscious pain and suffering immediately before his death because an expert testified, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that he experienced pain for about two minutes during the drowning process. The parents did not have to produce eyewitnesses or other direct evidence of his conscious pain and suffering before he died. To survive summary judgment, they only had to produce evidence from which a reasonable inference could be drawn that he experienced fear or fright or conscious pain while drowning, and they met this burden by showing that (1) he, a healthy five-year-old, entered the pool without adult supervision and without a life preserver, (2) he had no blow to the head or other physical problem rendering him unconscious before drowning, (3) it was more likely than not that he was conscious when he started to drown, and (4) once his head was under water, he had the usual pain and suffering associated with drowning. This evidence was not too speculative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment in favor of the company as to the parents' claim for the son's conscious pain and suffering was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for a new trial to find what damages, if any, the son's estate was entitled to recover for that conscious pain and suffering.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 5-119. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the due process rights of the hospital were not violated by the refiling since the patient's claims were still in ongoing litigation at the time &sect; 5-119 took effect. Although the hospital had received a favorable ruling on its motion to dismiss the initial complaint, that case was still on appeal and subject to further proceedings. There was no difference between the operative facts of the first complaint and those in the one filed after the effective date of &sect; 5-119. The only difference between the two suits was compliance with the technical requirements of a certificate of merit. As a consequence, the patient's claims had not expired, and no vested property interests of the hospital were infringed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police responded to a call of an attempted armed robbery. According to the victim, two black males approached him.

The victim could not provide a clear description, but defendant and another person were soon arrested nearby. The victim identified them as the assailants. Defendant and the other person were charged. Defendant petitioned to waive jurisdiction, a so-called &quot;reverse waiver,&quot; aimed at sending the case to the juvenile system. The trial court assumed that under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 4-202 it had to presume in ruling on the reverse waiver that the charged juvenile was guilty. It denied the reverse waiver request. During defendant's jury trial, the prosecutor referenced criminals picking on members of the Hispanic community, such as the victim, because they were easy targets. Defendant was found guilty of several offenses. The intermediate appellate court found that nothing in Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 4-202 (Repl.

Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 9-102 (2006), based on further deterioration of the parties relationship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that when a parent sought to modify an existing GVS visitation order, the parent's fundamental rights were paramount under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The desire of a fit parent to modify visitation with a third party, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, presented a material change in circumstances. The parent was presumably a fit parent, and had determined that the visitation schedule was no longer in the best interest of the child due to the interference of the grandparents in her daily life, the inability for the parties to communicate about the child, and the general breakdown in the relationship between the parties. It was presumed that the parent was acting in the child's best interest, and modification of the third-party visitation order denying visitation was required unless the grandparents overcame that presumption. The grandparents did not show that the parent was an unfit parent or that exceptional circumstances existed indicating that the lack of grandparent visitation would have a deleterious effect upon the child. Absent such a showing, the motion to modify had to be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of attempted second-degree murder, in violation of Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 2-206 (2002, 2006 Supp.); first-degree burglary, in violation of Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 6-202; and first-degree assault, in violation of Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 3-202. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) sentenced defendant to a total term of 50 years' incarceration. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by failing to remedy the constitutional violations arising from the State's gender-based exercise of its peremptory challenges. Defendant argued that the State proffered a patently gender-based explanation for its strikes against men, admitting it was striking men because they were men. The question before the appellate court was whether the State's desire to obtain a gender-balanced jury violated Batson and its progeny. The appellate court held that the State's objective, however well intentioned, was no more permissible than would be the exercise of a peremptory strike against a black juror in order to ensure the racial make-up of the community as a whole. By striking men to reduce the number of men on the jury, a discriminatory intent was inherent in the prosecutor's explanation. The appellate court also found no error in the trial court's refusal to dismiss the indictment to remedy the State's failure to preserve a diary belonging to the victim, where there was no finding that the State acted in bad faith in returning the diary to the victim and defendant could only speculate that the diary contained exculpatory evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was vacated and the case was remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The local board voted to approve the county school superintendent's recommendation that the officer be appointed chief business officer of the county public school system. Previously, he had served as a certificated public school employee in New York and Virginia. One of his responsibilities in his new position was to oversee the building of a new high school. Since the officer failed to relay certain project information to his superiors, it became unlikely the school could be timely built. The county school superintendent then terminated the officer's employment for use of poor judgment. The local board upheld that decision. The State Board affirmed. The trial court affirmed and also denied his 's declaratory relief request. The intermediate appellate court found that (1) because he was not a &quot;professional assistant&quot; under Md. Code Ann., Educ. &sect; 6-201(e), due to lack of the required Maryland certification, he was only entitled to administrative review of his termination rather than use of a more extensive review procedure, (2) he requested declaratory relief too late, and (3) it was within the intermediate appellate court's discretion whether to report an opinion in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former prisoner filed suit seeking a declaration that it was unconstitutional to require him to register as a sex offender. He challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which granted appellee, the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, summary judgment, arguing that Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. &sect; 11-707(a)(2)(i) (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.) violated the Maryland and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of rape. He was released from prison and was required to register as a sex offender. The court of special appeals held that the sex offender registry did not violate appellant's constitutional right to privacy, and the Maryland sex offender registration statute did not violate his procedural due process or equal protection rights. The statute conclusively presumed that anyone convicted of a sex offense was dangerous, so it was the fact of conviction that was relevant, not dangerousness itself. That presumption was permissible. The statute had a rational basis. Regardless of whether appellant was dangerous, the fact that he had been convicted of a sex crime made it statistically more likely that he would commit a sex crime in the future. While sex offenders were less likely than others released from prison to commit another crime, they were more likely than the general public or their fellow releasees to be convicted of a new sex crime. Appellant's right to privacy was not violated. Sex offenders did not have the right to keep their convictions under seal or otherwise away from the public eye simply because they found the convictions embarrassing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estranged wife of defendant was stabbed multiple times by defendant. When the police arrived, she identified defendant as the person who had stabbed her. During jury selection, the State exercised the first six of seven strikes against men, and, in total, exercised eight of its nine peremptory strikes against men. Defendant argued the State proffered a patently gender-based explanation for its strikes against men and admitted that it was striking men because they were men, in violation of Batson when the State admitted to trying to balance the jury. The appellate court held that since the State immediately volunteered its gender-based reason for its strikes, that concession relieved defendant of the obligation to prove that the State's strikes were gender-based. Alternatively, defendant satisfied the first prong by pointing to a pattern sufficient to support an inference of intentional discrimination. The State's explanation did not pass muster under Batson. The State had the burden of providing a gender-neutral explanation for its strikes. It failed to do so. There was no Brady violation in regard to a diary which the victim destroyed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county council, sitting as a district council, enacted a council bill which was a zoning text amendment. The citizens contended that the council bill, and the method used to enact it, were invalid. No effort was made to seek immediate judicial review of the council's action pursuant Md. Ann. Code art. 28, &sect; 8-106(e). On appeal, the court found that the adjudicatory remedies provided by the Maryland Regional District Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 28, &sect;&sect; 1-101 - 8-127 (1997 Repl. Vol.), for the resolution of the zoning issues were to be pursued and exhausted before resort to the courts. Further, no action was maintainable under the Maryland Declaratory Judgments Act, Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-401 et seq. (2006 Repl. Vol.), for the resolution of the issues. Furthermore, the allegations of invalidity made by the citizens were highly fact based, and the challenge to the council bill was intertwined with the need to consider evidence and render findings of fact such that the matter was to be initially resolved in the administrative proceeding. Finally, the constitutional exception to the exhaustion of administrative remedies did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) vacated and remanded the Tax Court's judgment as to both an admissions and amusement tax and a sales and use tax, and affirmed the Tax Court's determination that the taxpayer's constitutional argument was without merit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer operated boat clubs. At issue was whether the annual fees paid by the members were subject to taxation. On appeal, the court found that language in the club membership agreements that the agreements were made for the purposes of chartering the taxpayer's vessels and that the agreements were a full and complete demise of a vessel to the member, in conjunction with the testimony of members that they joined the clubs to use the boats, provided substantial evidence that the dominant purpose of the agreements was the members' use of the taxpayer's boats. Accordingly, there was substantial evidence that the membership fees constituted boat rental charges under Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 11-101(h) (2004, 2008 Supp.), which were subject to sales and use taxes under Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 11-102(a)(1) (2004, 2008 Supp.). In light of the taxpayer's concession that its boats were recreational equipment, entrance into the taxpayer's marina to use its boats was incidental to the use of the boats and, under Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 4-101(b)(1)(iv) (2004, 2008 Supp.), the use or rental of the boats was subject to the admissions and amusement tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, married couples who resided in Pennsylvania, challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), affirming a Tax Court judgment approving assessment of a Special Nonresident Tax (SNRT) against them. Each couple filed a joint nonresident income tax return in Maryland. The couples did not pay the amount required by Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 10-106.1 and were assessed by appellee Comptroller of the Treasury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband in each couple was a partner in a law firm with offices in Maryland. The SNRT was imposed on an individual subject to Maryland state income tax, but not to the county or local income tax. The couples claimed they were subjected to Maryland income tax at a rate more than 25% higher than that imposed on residents. They thus claimed the SNRT was unconstitutional. The instant court found the SNRT did not violate the Interstate Commerce Clause, Equal Protection Clause, or Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution. As the SNRT bore a fair and substantial relationship to the goal of requiring out-of-state residents to pay for governmental services, and did not impose a higher state income tax rate on nonresidents, it also did not violate Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24. The assessments against the couples included penalties and interest, but the plain language of the applicable sections in the Tax-General Article led to the conclusion that the Tax Court had authority to abate interest. An individual could appeal from assessment of interest and it would render Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 13-510(a)(1) a nullity and mere surplusage to conclude otherwise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the Tax Court that it had no authority to abate an interest assessment was reversed. The case was remanded to the Tax Court for consideration of abatement of interest assessment. All other judgments were affirmed. Costs were to be paid three-fourths by the couples and one-fourth by the Comptroller.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant grandparents sought reasonable grandparent visitation with the two children of their deceased son and appellee, his former wife. On remand from the instant court, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland, concluded that the evidence did not create a prima facie case of exceptional circumstances permitting application of the best interests standard, and granted the former wife's motion for judgment. The grandparents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the grandparents established a prima facie case of exceptional circumstances, under Koshko, which required a trial court in grandparent visitation cases to make a threshold determination of parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances before it applied the best interests standard. The instant court found there was only a limited relationship between the grandparents and the grandchildren and necessarily no evidence of current harm to the children from discontinuing the relationship. In addition, there was no evidence of future harm other than the grandparents' views as to what and when the children should be told or that might be inferred from the lack of visitation. If the lack of visitation, standing alone, constituted exceptional circumstances, the requirement would be meaningless. There had to be evidence of harm that resulted or likely would result from the refusal to provide visitation. The record offered only speculative evidence of future harm, which did not overcome the high evidentiary hurdle. The trial court speculated on reasons why there might be an adverse effect in the future, but there was no legally sufficient evidence of such an effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriff's deputy sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Harford County, Maryland, which found the deputy liable in a suit brought by appellant arrestee under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for use of excessive force in her arrest, in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The trial court denied the deputy's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This suit arose after the deputy pulled over the arrestee on suspicion that she was involved in a hit-and-run accident. As it turned out, the arrestee's vehicle was incorrectly identified and she was not involved in any accident. The arrestee alleged that the deputy used excessive force in the course of her arrest. While the jury failed to find malice under Maryland law, the jury found that the deputy used excessive force in violation of the U.S. Constitution, and then awarded punitive damages for that claim, even though the court did not instruct as to the malice standard for the federal claim, and the arrestee had not requested punitive damages. On review, the deputy argued that the verdict was irreconcilably inconsistent. The court disagreed because it held that the finding of no malice, barring recovery for punitive damages for State claims, did not preclude an award of punitive damages for excessive force under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The punitive damage standard for &sect; 1983 actions was not an actual malice standard, but a standard more akin to implied malice. Thus, the jury's finding of no actual malice did not foreclose a finding that the deputy acted with implied malice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A firearms owner sought review of a Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) dismissal under Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-706.1(b)(3) (2006) of his request for a contested case hearing to challenge a finding by appellee county department of social services (DSS) that he was responsible for indicated child neglect after he was convicted of reckless endangerment and child access to firearms arising out of the same incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the owner's criminal convictions for reckless endangerment under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 3-204 (Supp. 2007) and child access to firearms under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 4-104 did not establish the accuracy of all the information necessary to support DSS's finding that the owner had engaged in child neglect, obviating the need for a contested case hearing. The owner's appeal was improperly dismissed. The owner's guilt for reckless endangerment and child access to firearms did not require proof that the owner was a parent of, caretaker for, custodian of, or responsible for the child found in the owner's bed with his firearms. An individual's status to a child was an element of neglect. Since this status was not adjudicated in his criminal proceeding, the owner was entitled to a hearing to ensure that DSS's information was accurate. The owner insisted that he was not a caretaker of or responsible for the child when he engaged in the conduct for which he was convicted. He was entitled to an opportunity to challenge DSS's finding regarding his status before he was found and listed as responsible for indicated child neglect in a central registry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was vacated. The case was remanded to the trial court with directions to reverse the administrative decision and to remand the case to the OAH for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

A jury then awarded $ 2.3 million to the mother, which the trial court reduced to $ 515,000. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and daughter lived at property managers' property, which had chipping paint on the premises. The daughter was diagnosed with an elevated lead level when she was 10 months old. The property managers were informed of the problem, but did not fix it. The mother alleged in a lawsuit on the daughter's behalf that the property managers were negligent in maintaining the property and that they violated Maryland's Consumer Protection Act, Md. Code Ann., Com. Law &sect; 13-101 et seq. (Repl. Vol. 2005) (CPA). The trial court ruled for the mother as to liability on both theories. The jury awarded $2.3 million to her in noneconomic damages. The trial court reduced the verdict to $ 515,000 based on Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 11-108 (Repl. Vol. 2006)'s statutory cap. The intermediate appellate court found on her appeal that (1) the verdict was properly reduced since the statutory cap applied to all tortious conduct claims, including statutory claims, and not just to common law claims, (2) the statutory cap was not a &quot;special law&quot; violating Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 33, and (3) the cause of action arose when the noneconomic damages cap was $ 515,000, making that award proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a Maryland divorce action, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) denied ordering child support from appellee husband because appellant wife's child was not the husband's biological offspring. The wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband, in South Dakota, with the wife's consent, signed and filed with a birth records agency a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity of a child born to the wife before the couple met. The wife contended that, under South Dakota law, the husband, by voluntarily acknowledging paternity and by failing timely to seek to disestablish paternity, was presumed to be the father of her child. On appeal, the court found that the circuit court erred. South Dakota and Maryland statutes providing for voluntary acknowledgments of paternity, that were entitled to full faith and credit under U.S. Const. art. IV &sect; 1, were conditions of federal funding for child support enforcement under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 666. The federal statute required participating states to limit disestablishment of paternity to challenges filed within 60 days of acknowledgment, except for fraud, duress, and material mistake of fact. Under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-8-59 (1999 Rev., 2007 Supp.), acknowledgment of paternity became conclusive three years thereafter. If Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-1048 applied, there was no evidence of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law &sect; 5-1028(d).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, two former employees of a State's Attorney's Office, brought a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 suit against defendants, the State's Attorney (SA), county commissioners, and the State of Maryland, alleging in part violations of the First Amendment, Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 40, and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 207. The Circuit Court for Worcester County (Maryland) granted summary judgment to defendants. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, who had supported the SA's opponent in an election, were terminated when the SA took office. The court first held that because the SA did not show that political patronage was the sole motive for the discharge, the trial court should have applied the balancing test set forth in the Pickering-Mt. Healthy line of cases to the First Amendment claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Under this test, summary judgment for the SA was improper, as there were material issues of fact. As for the Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 40 claim, there was sufficient evidence that the SA acted with actual malice and thus did not enjoy immunity under the Maryland Tort Claims Act. An abusive discharge count was duplicative. The constitutional claims against the county were properly dismissed or disposed of on summary judgment. Plaintiffs had not shown that the SA was acting as the final policymaker for the county when he fired them or that the county participated in the wrongful decision to fire them. Finally, plaintiffs had produced enough evidence of control and of awareness of overtime practices for the county to be held liable under the FLSA and Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 3-415 (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the SA on the constitutional claims. It reversed the judgment in favor of the State on the Maryland constitutional claim. It reversed the judgment in favor of the county on the overtime claims. It affirmed the rest of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erroneously failed to strike opinion testimony of a non-expert witness and encouraged premature jury deliberations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was walking the victim home when the victim was punched in the head. Defendant denied hitting her. The victim called her father on her cell phone and asked him to pick her up. Defendant then carried the victim into a storage bin, threw her down, and threw her phone away. Defendant then forced the victim to perform fellatio multiple times and had anal intercourse with her. Defendant and the victim returned to the apartment. Witnesses at the apartment observed that she had a black eye and fresh bruising on the side of her face. The victim told them that she was raped by defendant. A nurse testified as to the victim's injuries including lacerations in her external anal region. The appellate court held her testimony regarding a blue dye test was an observation, not an opinion. The trial court gave two improper instructions to the jury. However, there was no meaningful likelihood that the error deprived defendant of a fair trial. The trial court did not err in failing to merge the sentences for second-degree sexual offense and false imprisonment. The prosecutor's improper comments were harmless error.</SPAN></P>

Vol.), personal jurisdiction existed over the employer, a Virginia corporation, because minimum contacts with Maryland had been established; the employee was a Maryland resident and was responsible for performing many of his duties regarding supervision of certain projects in Maryland. Even though the employer was a Virginia corporation, it was still was subject to the MWCPL as the plain language of the statute in &sect; 3-501(b) defined &quot;employer&quot; as one who employed an individual in Maryland. The employee was entitled to recover, inter alia, three times the wage owed because no bona fide dispute was shown under &sect; 3-507(b) as to whether the employee was owed severance pay because the incidents put forth to justify the termination were cobbled together after the fact to avoid paying the severance money owed.</SPAN></P>

The suppression hearing court directed that the evidence be suppressed. The State of Maryland appealed pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-302(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer submitted an affidavit in support of the issuance of a search warrant. The affidavit described how a confidential informant was used in a controlled buy of crack cocaine from defendant. The suppression hearing judge determined that the issuance of the warrant for the search of defendant's person violated the Fourth Amendment because probable cause was lacking in that the officer did not state in the affidavit that officers actually observed the controlled buy. On appeal, the court found that there was a substantial basis for the issuance of the warrant for either of two reasons. First, there was a permitted inference that the police surveillance of the controlled buy was uninterrupted and that alone constituted a substantial basis for the issuance of the warrant. Secondly, even if, arguendo, there had been a gap in the surveillance, the independent police verification was still sufficient to satisfy the substantial basis standard. Alternatively, even if, arguendo, there had not been a substantial basis for the issuance of the warrant, the application was not so lacking as to preclude the application of the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule of evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church had a double-sided sign. That sign could only be seen by a limited number of travelers. Its location was not close enough to a highway exit from which the church could be accessed such that the sign could direct travelers to its site. The church wanted to place a much bigger sign on its property and sought a variance pursuant to Baltimore County, Md., Zoning Regulation &sect; 307.1. After a deputy zoning commissioner took evidence and denied the variance request, the appellate board found following an evidentiary hearing that the property was not unique. The appellate board also found that denial of the variance did not work a substantial burden on the church's religious exercise, and, as such, did not violate the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc et seq. The intermediate appellate court, applying highly deferential review to the uniqueness finding, determined that substantial evidence in the record supported that conclusion. It also determined that the sign regulations did not place pressure on adherents to modify their behavior and, accordingly, did not violate their religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland) denied appellant Chairman of the Maryland Public Service Commission's (PSC) request for a preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals determined certain provisions violated the State Constitution and ordered the trial court to enter a permanent injunction in favor of PSC. The PSC then filed an amended complaint, adding appellee Governor and others and new claims. The trial dismissed that complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor and others contended that the PSC already received the relief it sought, and any new theories were duplicative and moot or barred by the law of the case doctrine. The appellate court held the facts alleged in the amended complaint and the original complaint were the same. The PSC did not allege new facts in the amended complaint on the ground that it was mistaken as to the originally alleged facts or that it became aware of new facts. It could have included the additional defendants, new federal and state claims, and new claim for relief in the original complaint, but did not. The Court of Appeals addressed the merits of the claims in the original complaint, and issued a final judgment on the merits. Its judgment was the law of the case as to the facts alleged in the original complaint. Without pleading additional facts, the PSC could not now add new defendants and claims. That would be contrary to the law of the case, and would, in effect, permit piecemeal litigation. Consequently, the trial court did not err in dismissing the amended complaint. There was no substantive basis upon which to award attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the guardian of a mentally retarded adult, applied for the admission of her ward to a state residential center (SRC). Appellee, the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, denied the request. The administrative review of the request was dismissed. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) granted the Department's motion to dismiss the guardian's petition for judicial review. The guardian appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian sought the admission of her ward, who was a Medicaid recipient, to a SRC under Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 7-502. The Secretary denied the request. Pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 7-503, the Maryland statutory scheme provided for a contested case hearing under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect;&sect; 10-201 through 10-226 (2004, 2006 Supp.), when the Secretary determined that admission was appropriate to a SRC. However, it did not afford any opportunity to contest the Secretary's determination to deny admission to a SRC. Thus, the Secretary contended that the decision to deny could not be reviewed. On appeal, the court found that the admission to a SRC was a state benefit. If an applicant met the eligibility criteria in Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 7-502, the applicant was entitled to admission without regard to the exercise of discretion of the Secretary. Accordingly, procedural due process was denied under the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24 because the statutory scheme did not provide for a hearing in connection with the denial of the application for admission to the SRC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was vacated, and the case was remanded to the circuit court with instructions to remand to the Department's Board of Review for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which reversed a final decision of an administrative law judge of the Department upholding the constitutionality of Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 19-906 (2005) and held that appellee licensee held a vested property right in its license issued prior to the amendments made to &sect; 19-906.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since 1982, the licensee had held a statewide license to provide home-based hospice care, pursuant to the prior version &sect; 19-906. Upon the Maryland General Assembly substantially amending &sect; 19-906 in 2003, the Department informed the licensee that it was no longer able to provide home-based hospice services in two counties. The licensee appealed the alteration of its license, challenging the constitutionality of the amendments to the statute. Following a hearing the Department upheld the changes made to the license. The licensee filed its petition for judicial review in the trial court. The trial court ruled that the license issued in 1982 was a vested property right afforded constitutional protection, that &sect; 19-906(c)(3) was arbitrary, and that the alterations to the license constituted a taking. The court disagreed, holding that, like other professional licenses, a license to deliver home-based hospice was not an absolute vested right, but only a conditional right which was subordinate to the police power of the State to protect and preserve the public health. As such, the 2003 amendments did not violate the licensee's constitutional rights nor constitute a taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, property owners, challenged the denial by a city board of zoning appeals of a front yard setback variance that would have enabled the owners to build a one car garage within three feet of the street along their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board denied the requested variance after finding that no hardship existed, and that the claimed hardship was self-created. The appellate court held that the board properly determined that no hardship existed. The record showed merely that an owner's son visited the owners, and did not reside there. It did not reveal the frequency or duration of his visits. Moreover, there was no evidence to prove a particular physical surrounding, shape, or topographical condition of the specific property prevented the vehicular loading of the son's wheelchair, for which the owners sought the garage variance. The essence of the owners' argument was that a garage would make loading more convenient. Former Annapolis, Md., City Code &sect; 21.80.030(A) required more than a showing of mere inconvenience to grant a variance. Furthermore, the appellate court held that the record supported the board's finding that the owners created the need for the variance by developing the property before obtaining the garage variance. When they built their house and pool, the owners eliminated the possibility of locating a garage where no variance would be required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The psychiatrist was engaged by the defense in a federal espionage case to perform a forensic psychiatric evaluation of the &quot;evaluee.&quot; The psychiatrist disclosed information he had learned from the evaluee to his wife and then, after being discharged by the evaluee and his counsel, to local, national, and international media outlets. In response to the psychiatrist's challenges, the court of special appeals concluded, inter alia, that: (1) the Board had jurisdiction to adjudicate and impose sanctions because the investigation into a complaint against the psychiatrist had begun before his license expired, precluding his licence from lapsing; (2) the forensic evaluation performed was the practice of medicine and the unethical conduct occurred in the practice of medicine because the duty to maintain confidences did not end when the psychiatrist was terminated from the defense team; (3) the admission of the evaluee's testimony by telephone was permissible; and (4) the &quot;moral imperative&quot; or community interest exception to the psychiatrist's duty to maintain the evaluee's confidences did not apply, as the evaluee did not pose a danger to the public at the time of the disclosures.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., Health Occ. &sect; 14-404(a)(33) (1981, 2000 Repl. Vol., 2004 Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board had received a written complaint against the doctor, a licensed psychiatrist, that he was over-medicating three patients, namely the complainant's estranged wife and two of her children. In response to the complaint, the Board issued a subpoena commanding the doctor to produce a copy of the patients' medical records. Initially, the patients invoked their federal constitutional right of privacy and refused to consent to the doctor's disclosure but later consented. Eleven months later, the Board charged the doctor with failing to cooperate, despite the doctor being absolved of any over-medication allegation after a peer review evaluation. The court held that, as a matter of law, the doctor did not fail to cooperate by not furnishing the patients' psychiatric records in response to the subpoena, until the patients withdrew their privacy objection. The court found that substantial evidence in the agency record established that the Board's interest in obtaining the patients' psychiatric records to investigate the standard of care allegation leveled by the complainant did not outweigh the patients' privacy interests in those highly personal records.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his coram nobis petition because the record of his Alford plea contained neither a factual basis in support of the plea nor an adequate explanation of the elements of the crime. The court held that the probation before judgment received by appellant constituted a conviction for purposes of qualifying for relief under a coram nobis petition since his probation before judgment prevented him from receiving a sentence less than the mandatory term required under the applicable sentencing guidelines. The court also found that appellant's petition was properly denied because, although the record did not secure a representation from defense counsel that appellant had been properly informed of the elements of the crime, prior to accepting appellant's guilty plea, the trial judge explained all of the elements of the crime of uttering. Further, the record demonstrated that in the plea colloquy, appellant advised the trial court that he had received, read, and understood the statement of charges and that he had, in fact, discussed the same with his attorney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of his motion to suppress, defendant, a juvenile, was found guilty of possession of cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of a tobacco product by a person under the age of 18. The Circuit Court for Wicomico County (Maryland) placed defendant on conditional release with electronic monitoring, pending a placement in a juvenile facility. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers observed defendant riding his bicycle on the wrong side of the road, without a headlight, in violation of traffic regulations for bicycles. While approaching defendant to inform him of the violation, the officers noticed defendant was smoking a cigarette and appeared to be under the age of 18, a violation of Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law &sect; 10-108. Defendant admitted he was 17 years old, after which the officers frisked him for the purpose of discovered and confiscating any additional tobacco products. The issue before the appellate court was whether the commission of the civil violation justified the warrantless search of defendant. The appellate court concluded that the warrantless search was not justified. Among other things, the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement was not applicable because the cigarettes were not &quot;contraband.&quot; The search could not be justified as a legitimate stop-and-frisk under Terry as no effort was made to justify the search based on a reasonable concern for officer safety. Finally, because the search was illegal, the crack cocaine found should have been suppressed, leaving insufficient evidence to support the delinquency finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents had two children, both of whom were minors. Due to parental neglect, appellee county social services agency placed the two children in shelter care. By agreement of all of the parties, the children were determined to be in need of assistance (CINA) and a CINA declaration was made. The two children were then placed with their paternal aunt. The county social services agency's permanency plan was reunification with the parents. The trial court ordered the parents to address various issues, including substance abuse, that had led to the CINA determination.  Thereafter, at a permanency plan hearing, the trial court heard argument that the parents were making minimal progress, but that the two children were doing well in the parental aunt's custody. The trial court then changed the permanency plan from reunification with the parents to custody and guardianship with the paternal aunt. The trial court later closed the CINA case. On appeal, the intermediate appellate court found that the trial court erred in closing the CINA case before making &quot;active efforts&quot; to prevent break-up of the family, as required by the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1901 et seq.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens sought review of order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) which found that appellee Land Use and Planning Committee violated the Open Meetings Act, Md. Code Ann., States Gov't, &sect;&sect; 10-51 et seq., when it acted upon proposed legislation that was ultimately adopted by the City Council. The issues were, inter alia, whether the trial court erred in assessing counsel fees against the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislation at issue arose from the efforts of appellee company to establish a parking lot. The bill was signed into law. The citizens filed a complaint against the city and the company, alleging that the Committee's meeting and action on the bill was conducted in violation of the Open Meetings Act. The trial court found that the Committee violated the Open Meetings Act and awarded reasonable counsel fees. The appellate court held the Committee violated the Open Meetings Act by recommending an amendment to the bill without first allowing the public an opportunity to hear the reasoning behind the recommendation. However, the City Council's subsequent actions, taken at public meetings, &quot;cured&quot; the violation committed by the Committee. Because the subsequent open City Council meeting provided an adequate opportunity for citizens to hear and participate in the deliberations of Bill 03-1228, the trial court was correct in upholding the enactment of the bill. Since the citizens were not &quot;prevailing&quot; parties as they received no relief on the merits of their claim. Because they did not obtain any of the relief that they requested, they did not qualify for the counsel fee award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision to assess counsel fees against the City was reversed. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

After a motions judge denied the officer's motion for summary judgment, the trial judge found the matter to be moot. The motions judge then ordered judgment for the department. The officer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An investigation, which included the files at issue, was initiated after a citizen's complaint was lodged that could have led to disciplinary actions.

After the investigating officers had searched for the files, without success, in a cabinet at the station, a district commander then issued a written administrative order for the production of the files. Investigators then went to the officer's residence with him and retrieved the subject files from the officer's residence. On appeal, the court found that a determination of whether the Maryland Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, Md. Code Ann., Pub. Safety &sect;&sect; 3-101 through 3-113, was triggered by an investigation was never an issue presented to the trial court, that the recovery of police files from the officer's residence did not violate Fourth Amendment proscriptions against unreasonable seizures, and that the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing the request of the officer's counsel to present argument on his motion for severance ex parte or to discuss the basis of his motion with the court in private.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its murder prosecution against defendant, the State appealed a pre-trial ruling by the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) suppressing from evidence inculpatory statements defendant gave to the police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from her involvement in a robbery in which a victim was killed. The trial court granted the motion to suppress based on a Miranda violation. The appellate court held that the inclusion of the words &quot;at some time&quot; into the advisement that if defendant could not afford an attorney, one would be provided to her, did not render the warnings deficient. The warnings told defendant in plain language that she had the right to talk to a lawyer before being questioned and to have a lawyer present during questioning. Nothing suggested that the right only applied if defendant could afford an attorney. However, the appellate court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-302(c)(3) (2006 Repl. Vol.), to consider defendant's argument that the statements were involuntary. The appellate court could not say that incriminating statements made after a detective made implied promises that defendant would receive special benefits by elimination or reduction of charges if she spoke in no way resulted from the improper promises. Thus, the statements made after the detective made the implied promises were properly suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to statements made by defendant after a detective made implied promises of benefit, but the judgment was vacated as to statements made after defendant was advised of her Miranda rights but before the detective made the implied promises.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 15-713(1) (2004), by being engaged for lobbying purposes for compensation that was contingent upon executive or legislative action, and, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 15-405(e), sanctioned the lobbyist. The Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland) affirmed. The lobbyist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lobbyist was engaged by a businessman to lobby for a business entity. The lobbyist registered as a lobbyist for the business entity and billed for legislative expenses under a contract which included a fee agreement, the language of which provided for compensation of one percent of all first year receivables for each facility, location, or contract the lobbyist was involved in securing for the business entity with any government entity, unit, or agency in the State of Maryland. The lobbyist insisted that the language regarding compensation was added to the fee agreement at the businessman's request, but the lobbyist did not call the businessman to testify. On appeal, the court found that (1) the Commission's findings were supported by substantial evidence; (2) the lobbyist's registration was required under Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 15-701; and (3) the Commission did not improperly apply Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 15-405(e) retroactively to sanction the lobbyist. Additionally, the Commission did not err by drawing an adverse inference under the missing man rule from the businessman's failure to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners requested three variances from a county board of appeals to construct a home on their property. Appellees, the county and the neighbors, objected to the variances. The board denied the variances. The owners timely appealed the board's decision to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland). The circuit court affirmed the board's decision, denying the requested variances. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners requested the variances to permit them to build a home on one of their two property lots. Two of the owners' requests were for variances from the Maryland critical area program. The third request was for a variance from a setback requirement under general zoning requirements. On appeal, the court found that the board applied the correct law in interpreting Anne Arundel County, Md., Code art. 3, &sect; 2-107(b) (1985) (current version at Anne Arundel County, Md., Code art. 3, &sect; 1-207) as requiring compliance with all of the criteria under Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect; 8-1808. However, the board made no distinction between the general zoning variance and the critical area variance, although the criteria were not the same. Additionally, no evidence or reasonable inferences could be drawn from the evidence to support certain of the board's conclusions. Therefore, on remand, the board was to provide an explanation in determining whether the owners' proposal met the variance criteria and, specifically, whether they would be denied reasonable and significant use of the entire lot. The board was also to consider one owners' likely disability, if any, and make appropriate findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court's judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the circuit court with instructions to vacate the decision of the board and to remand the matter to the board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Comptroller of the Treasury, challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Allegany County (Maryland), which reduced a motor fuel tax assessment against appellee, a coal company, from $ 9,036.28 to $ 5,491.90. On cross-appeal, appellee challenged the methodology used by appellant and asserted that the Maryland Tax Court abused its discretion by denying its request for a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee held a special fuel user license that allowed it to purchase fuel in bulk without having to pay motor fuel tax to its seller. Each month, appellee was required to file a return in appellant's office setting forth the amount of taxable fuel used and pay the tax on that fuel. In making the reduction, the trial court reasoned that a portion of the assessment, affirmed by the Tax Court, was not supported by substantial evidence. The court held that there was substantial evidence in the record to support appellant's assessment based on the testimony of appellant's inspector, who testified that two of appellee's drivers were found using untaxed dyed fuel on the highway during a random inspection. The only evidence appellee introduced to demonstrate that appellant's assessment was incorrect was the testimony of its two principals, which the Tax Court properly found insufficient. The court also upheld appellant's determination that appellee's records were inadequate and that the methodology used in calculating the assessment was correct. Appellee failed to show any abuse of discretion on the part of the Tax Court in denying its request for a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, in part, the order of the trial court reducing the motor fuel tax assessment and affirmed, in part, the order denying appellee's request for a jury trial. The court's decision affirmed the Tax Court's decision in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the issues were important to the public and were likely to recur in the future with respect to other parks. The decision to close the park did not amount to a change in use under Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. 8A-202(c)(3) as the clear intent in enacting that provision was to provide park residents protection only as long as the property was used as a mobile home park. Thus, Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 8A-1201 did not apply. The owners had satisfied all of the elements of Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 8A-1702(b)(2) where they gave the tenants a one-year notice of the park closure and the rental agreements had terminated no later than the date the park had closed. The retaliatory eviction provisions in Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 8A-1301 and Howard County, Ind. Code &sect; 16.516 did not apply as the owners had a right to cease operating as a mobile home park upon giving the requisite notice. At the end of the notice term, they had the right to initiate tenant holdover proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court (Maryland) granted defendant city's motion for summary judgment on appellant adult business's claim that the city's adult business ordinance violated the adult business's free speech rights under U.S. Const. amend. I and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 40. The adult business appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance prohibited adult businesses from completely closing any area used for viewing motion pictures and set forth requirements for denying an adult business license. The adult business, which was granted a license pursuant to the ordinance, did not dispute the circuit court's ruling that the ordinance was a content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction that left open ample alternative channels for communication. The adult business argued that the ordinance was not narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest because the ordinance's legislative record contained no preenactment evidence demonstrating that the ordinance was intended to address specific negative secondary effects. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional because (1) the city relied on reports from citizens regarding illegal drug activity and sexual activity at the adult business and on the observations of city officials concerning dangerous conditions on the premises and (2) the evidence the city relied upon was reasonably believed to be relevant to the ordinance's purposes of promoting safe and sanitary conditions and combating the spread of sexually transmitted disease.</SPAN></P>
