<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (PennDot), appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which sustained appellee licensee's appeal from PennDot's requirement that he install an ignition interlock device on all vehicles owned by him before his operating privilege could be restored.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was convicted in New Jersey of driving under the influence (DUI). PennDot informed the licensee that his operating privilege would be suspended for one year. Because the licensee had previously been convicted of DUI in Pennsylvania, the licensee was further notified that following the completion of the one-year suspension, he would be obligated to equip his vehicles with the ignition interlock system, and failure to comply would result in an additional one-year suspension of his operating privilege. On appeal, PennDot argued that the trial court erred in rescinding the ignition interlock device requirement from the restoration of the licensee's operating privilege because it had an independent mandate to enforce the requirements of the Ignition Interlock Device Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7001-7003. The appellate court concluded that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7002 plainly vested the authority and responsibility to impose the interlock requirement solely in the trial court. Merely because the trial court had failed to impose the ignition interlock requirement for any reason did not give PennDot the authority to impose such a sanction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate said the board deprived him of due process and retroactively applied 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9718.1, requiring sex offender treatment, to him, contrary to ex post facto clauses. The inmate did not show the board applied &sect; 9718.1 to him. Had the board applied &sect; 9718.1, no ex post facto violation would have occurred, as the statute only applied to offenses committed after its effective date, although consideration of its factors as to earlier offenses was allowed, and the board had discretion to decide if the inmate should receive treatment. It was not shown that the statute's retroactive application created a sufficient risk of increased punishment to invoke ex post facto protections. The statute was not penal, as its actual and objective purposes and effect were not punishment, as the inmate could not be incarcerated for more than his maximum term. When denying parole, the board considered factors required by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 331.19, and this did not violate due process. Mandamus was not available, as granting parole was a discretionary act appropriately exercised by the board when it denied the inmate parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth court affirmed the order of the board of finance and revenue, which subjected petitioner taxpayer to corporate net income (CNI) tax. The taxpayer excepted to this ruling, and respondent Commonwealth excepted to the court's reversal of the board's order subjecting the taxpayer to capital stock tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The definition of &quot;corporation&quot; in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 7401 was amended to include business trusts, thereby subjecting the taxpayer to CNI tax liability as of the amendment's effective date, January 1, 1995. The taxpayer argued it owed no tax, as its 52-53 week tax period began on December 27, 1994. The court disagreed. Section 7401(3)1(k), which provided that taxpayers who used a 52-53 week period would be deemed calendar year taxpayers, if the period ended near December 31, prevailed over &sect; 7401(5)'s definition of &quot;taxable year&quot; as that used for filings with the IRS; the former was a special provision, and there was no showing the legislature intended the later enacted general provision to prevail. The taxpayer was entitled to an abatement of penalties, as it acted in good faith and without fraudulent intent in construing the amendments; that it did not prevail on any of its arguments was immaterial. But, as &sect; 7401(3)1(k) had not been incorporated into the capital stock tax article of the Tax Reform Code, the taxpayer remained a fiscal year taxpayer with a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1995, and owed no capital stock tax for the 1995 tax year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's exceptions were granted in part, in that the taxpayer's penalty was abated. In all other respects, the exceptions were denied. The exceptions of the Commonwealth were denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County (Pennsylvania), which assessed the value of its property for the 2000 tax year at $ 8,500,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the property owner argued that the trial court's application of the predetermined ratio of 100 percent to its property violated the principles of uniformity and equal protection. Specifically, the property owner argued that its shopping center was assessed higher than other shopping centers in Chester County and therefore the assessment violated Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, the Uniformity Clause of Pennsylvania Constitution. The appellate court found that there was no dispute that Chester County conducted a countywide reassessment in 1996 at which time the county commissioners set the established predetermined ratio at 100 percent of market value. Also, there was no dispute that the purchase price of the property was $ 10,422,978 and that the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) ratio for 1999 was 89.8 percent and that the STEB ratio for 2000 (the year of the tax appeal) was 85.2 percent. Because the STEB ratio (85.2 percent) varied less than 15 percent of the established predetermined ratio of 100 percent, the trial court properly assessed the fair market value of the property at 100 percent or $ 8,500,000.</SPAN></P>

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court vacated the instant court's order of dismissal and remanded for consideration on the merits.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority administered the city's on-street parking functions and paid the city rent. Section &sect; 5508.1(e) gave the governor the power to appoint members of the authority, and &sect; 5508.1(q) required the authority to transfer some of its retained earnings to a city school district. Plaintiffs claimed that the Commonwealth, by enacting &sect; 5508.1, reneged on a promise that the city would retain control of the authority, and that &sect; 5508.1 violated the Pennsylvania Constitution. The instant court held that (1) the city lacked standing to assert claims of its citizens against the Commonwealth; (2) the Home Rule Doctrine did not apply because the authority was a Commonwealth, not a municipal, agency, and Home Rule principles and city ordinances could not prohibit legislative amendments; (3) no constitutional rights were implicated by amendment of a statute; (4) &sect; 5508.1 was not an invalid &quot;special law&quot; under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32; and (5) 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5508.1 did not violate the &quot;single subject rule&quot; of Pa. Const. art.

Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect;&sect; 6018.101-.1003, and Act 101, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 4000.101-.1904. The court further supported the EHB's conclusion that it could consider economic and social issues when implementing a solid waste program, balanced against the environmental concerns. The harms/benefits tests was not void for vagueness and set adequate standards and guidelines to avoid a challenge under the non-delegation requirement of legislation, pursuant to Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The court found no abuse of discretion in the Board's determination as to each facility's permit application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner purported electric generation suppliers challenged a decision by respondents, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, which assessed the suppliers their share of the cost of administering &quot;public utilities&quot; under 66 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suppliers were assessed their share of administration costs. The suppliers objected, arguing that they were electric generation suppliers and thus not subject to the assessment. The court granted the application for summary relief filed by the Commonwealth and the Commission. The court examined the purpose, scope, subject matter, powers, and duties set forth in the Electricity Generation Customer Choice and Competition Act, 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 2801- 2812, and concluded that the legislature had set forth definite and reasonable standards for the regulation of electric generation supplier companies. The legislature's direction with respect to licensing, financial responsibility, reserve margins, and billing practices was clear. The legislature required that the Commission consider the present quality of service, the protection of the public, and the safety and reliability of the system. The Commission did not have &quot;unfettered&quot; discretion, as contended by the suppliers.  66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 510 of the Public Utility Code required each public utility to bear a reasonable share of the Commission's costs and the suppliers, as public utilities, were required to comply.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 1909(c)(5). The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association sought exemption from licensing requirements under &sect; 1909(c)(5) of the Social Workers, Marriage and Family Therapists and Professional Counselors Act, as its members had all passed a certification exam. The Board refused, finding that the association's exam was narrowly tailored to test addictions counselors rather than the entire spectrum of &quot;professional counseling,&quot; as that term was defined in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 1903(1), (2). The court held that this finding was supported by substantial evidence. The Act did not delegate legislative power in violation of Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 by failing to provide standards for the Board's approval of a national credential for licensure without examination. The guide for determining when the examination requirement was to be waived was contained in the definition of &quot;professional counseling&quot;; and as the association was put on notice as to what was required to be placed on the exemption list, the Act was not unconstitutionally vague. The Board did not discriminate against the association in violation of Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1 by treating it differently than other similarly situated organizations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and association's disputed issues regarding employment terms and conditions for police officers were resolved by arbitration. The trial court affirmed the arbitrator's award limiting excessive retirement benefits for future police officers, affirmed the award to the extent that it failed to incorporate the residency requirement of the city home rule charter, and vacated that part of the award that permitted a health care plan change. On appeal, the court held that the award did not diminish retirement benefits for past or current police officers, and that the award with respect to future officers was supported by Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 and 53 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 2962(c)(3) and represented a fair balancing of the interests. The residency requirement was properly submitted as an arbitrable issue because the provisions of City of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Home Rule Charter &sect; 8:02 did not supersede the authority of the arbitrators. Lastly, the court found that the issue of a health care plan change was noticed as an arbitrable issue and was properly determined by the arbitrator within the total context of the award. Accordingly, vacatur of that portion of the award was error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality enacted an ordinance which required all owners of improved property within its boundaries to connect to the municipal water system, further restricted any connection between the town's system and private well plumbing, and directed to which limited uses private well water could be put. Some of the association's members owned and used private wells that had not yet been connected to the municipal water system. The association's complaint sought an order preventing enforcement of the ordinance due to its alleged unconstitutionality, requested that the municipality conduct a study as to the need for the ordinance, and sought monetary relief. The court affirmed the dismissal, holding that property owners did not have a constitutional property right to use their private well water because the ordinance was substantially related to promotion of the public health, safety, or general welfare of the municipality. Accordingly, the mandatory connection was authorized by &sect;&sect; 1202 and 2461 of the Borough Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 46202, 47461.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner motorist filed a petition against respondent bureau of driver licensing, seeking a declaration that his operating privilege was restored by operation of law, as well as injunctive relief enjoining the bureau from enforcing its suspension of his operating privilege and directing that his driving privilege be reinstated. The bureau filed preliminary objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bureau notified the motorist that his driver's license was being suspended. However, the motorist never surrendered his license to the bureau. The motorist argued that his license had been restored by operation of law since the one-year period of the suspension had passed. The court ruled that under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1541(a), the period of suspension began on the surrender of the operator's license, and no credit toward the suspension period was received until the license was surrendered. The motorist also argued that 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1541 violated equal protection and was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that driving was a privilege, not a fundamental right. Because 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1541 applied to all those who used the state's highways, it did not burden a suspect class. The requirement that a suspended driver surrender his or her license for the suspension period was rationally related to the goal of protecting those who used the highways by keeping suspended drivers off the road.  75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1541(a), as implemented by 67 Pa. Code &sect; 89.1- 89.4, met due process requirements, as it contained sufficient standards to guide prospective conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was bound by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The case was identical to a prior case as to the facts and identical as to the legal issues that had been litigated to final judgment. The only difference was in the parties, but the claimant was in privity with the prior claimant. Under the plain language of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 677, &sect; 71(a), the employer had to be directly liable for the payment of compensation to receive a credit. However, the contested benefit for which the employer sought credit may have been fully funded by the employer through a retrospective premium arrangement, a minimum premium plan, or any of a number of devices by which employers funded the payment of workers' compensation. The court remanded to the Board for additional findings on the funding arrangement between the employer's insurer and the employer for the policy in question.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer filed for a refund of the use tax it paid on stone and oil used in its construction projects for respondent Commonwealth's transportation department. The appeals board denied the refund. The taxpayer then appealed the decision to the Pennsylvania State Agency Board of Finance and Revenue, which also denied a refund. The taxpayer petitioned for judicial review of the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed a refund on two theories. First, it claimed a manufacturing exemption, because it used the stone and oil to manufacture asphalt. Second, it claimed that under its highway improvement contract, it sold the transportation department the asphalt, and sales to the department were exempt from sales tax. Whenever the department made a direct purchase of asphalt from the taxpayer, a sales tax was not collected because the department was exempt. The taxpayer argued that it was not logical to exempt the department from the payment of sales tax when it directly used the taxpayer's asphalt, but not from the indirect payment of the use tax when it entered into a construction contract with the taxpayer. Whether logical or not, the reviewing court found that the tax was proper, and firmly grounded in statute. The court found that the term &quot;manufacture,&quot; as used in the exemption for manufactured goods, did not include the use of materials that became fixed to real estate, as was the asphalt at issue in the instant case. In addition, the installation of the asphalt was considered a &quot;use&quot; of the materials, rather than a retail sale. The tax was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmates sought partial summary judgment with respect to a five-count petition against respondents, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and state officials. The Department and officials filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The complaint stemmed from the Department's refusal to allow the inmates receipt of certain issues of &quot;men's magazines,&quot; after finding the materials to be obscene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates were forbidden from receiving certain magazines, and filed suit. The court granted summary judgment for the Department and officials as to the inmates' claim that the Department's incoming publications policy, found in 37 Pa. Code &sect; 93.2, was null and void because it violated 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5903. The Department's policy was consistent with the statutory provisions. The 1998 amendments to &sect; 5903 were constitutional on their face and as applied. The absolute prohibition under &sect; 6602(a)-(c) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6602(a)-(c), against allowing an inmate to litigate without paying a filing fee was unconstitutional and the inmates were granted prospective relief on the issue. Section 6602(e) of the Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6602(e), was construed as applying only to those prison condition cases where in forma status pauperis was sought. Section 6602(f) of the Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6602(f), which dealt with abusive litigation, did not present a separation of powers problem. The Department was not required to promulgate its assessment policy and procedure, found in &sect; 6608 of the Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6608, as a regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the cross-motion by the Department and officials for summary judgment on the claims concerning the challenge to the obscenity statute's amendments, the purported requirement to promulgate a regulation regarding inmate assessments, and the application of an assessment policy. The court granted prospective relief to the inmates as to the constitutionality of certain portions of the Act regarding forma status pauperis filing fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorneys for claimant employee in the underlying action sought review of an order of respondent Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Board that affirmed a workers' compensation judge's order approving a settlement between the employee and respondent employer but refused to approve a fee for the attorneys in excess of 20 percent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the employer sought to terminate the employee's receipt of workers' compensation benefits, the attorneys represented her and assisted her in obtaining a settlement. The lump sum settlement package presented to the workers' compensation judge (WCJ) for approval included a fee for the attorneys of one-third of the total. The WCJ approved the settlement, but determined, pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 998, that the attorneys had provided no special services that entitled them to more than the standard 20 percent fee provided for in the statute. The attorneys argued that this provision, in giving WCJs the power to approve fees, violated Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10, which gave the highest court of the commonwealth the exclusive power to regulate the legal profession. The court held that, on the contrary, like Pa. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5, the statutory provision simply helped to guide a WCJ in determining the reasonableness and propriety of fee agreements, but it did not limit a WCJ in allowing higher fees where appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee probationary police officer appealed the decision of appellant borough council terminating his employment. The Common Pleas Court of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) directed that the case be remanded to the council to afford the officer a post-termination hearing. The borough council and appellant borough sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borough maintained that appellate decisions on which the trial court based its decision were implicitly overruled. The appellate court held that a probationary employment period was one in which an employee had to show he could perform a job before being permanently employed. The term &quot;probationary&quot; indicated a legislative intent that a probationary employee had no expectation of continued employment. If no review of the decision to discharge the officer was permitted, that indicated the decision to discharge him was discretionary with the employer. Constitutionally, whether the officer was entitled to an appeal was not determined by statutory language, but by whether the statute conferred a property right on him. No property right was conferred by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 46186 of the Borough Code, providing that a probationary police officer could be dismissed if his conduct was not satisfactory. He was not entitled to a pre-or post-termination hearing, the borough's decision to dismiss him was not subject to appeal, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter, and it erred in ordering a post-termination hearing.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner's contention was that the Board was unconstitutionally relying on information used by the sentencing court in order to extend unlawfully his minimum sentence into a maximum one. The Board preliminarily objected by way of a demurrer, claiming that it was mandated to consider the same information as the sentencing court in deciding whether to grant parole. The court sustained the Board's demurrer and dismissed petitioner's writ, holding that the Board considered the necessary and proper factors in its determination, pursuant to Section 19 of the Parole Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 331.19. The court found that the Board's denial was based in part on the fact that petitioner did not complete a treatment program for substance abuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a pro se petition for a writ of mandamus against respondent Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, contending that the Board's application of a certain amendment to the Probation and Parole Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 331.1, and changes to the Board's guidelines unconstitutionally violated the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. amend. I, &sect; 10(1). The Board filed an application for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pled guilty to murder and aggravated assault and was sentenced to serve not less than 7 and no more than 15 years in a state prison.

Petitioner did not file any countervailing affidavits, pursuant to Pa. R. Civ. P. 1035.3, that the section of the Parole Act was applied to his case. As a result, the only evidence was the Board's affidavit and certificate, and they specified that &sect; 1 of the Parole Act was not applied to petitioner's case and did not increase the likelihood that he would be refused parole. Rather, they relied upon the factors contained in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 331.19 regarding defendant's prison behavior and applied those factors to his case. Furthermore, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 331.1 (1996) did not facially violate the proscription against ex post facto laws. Section 1 did not modify the statutory punishment for any particular offense, did not alter the standards for determining the initial date of parole eligibility, and did not alter existing standards for an inmate's suitability for parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant estate appealed the order of the Orphans' Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of the Forty-First Judicial District, Perry County Branch (Pennsylvania), which dismissed the estate's appeal from an inheritance tax assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the estate argued that the trial court misinterpreted the intent of the legislature and, alternatively, that the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 9101- 9196, violated the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Equal Protection Clauses of both the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. The appellate court found that the case involved a transfer from a stepchild to a stepmother. The plain language of the Act did not include transfers from a stepchild to a stepparent at the lineal six percent rate. Thus, transfers to stepparents fell under the catch-all 15 percent collateral rate. In addition, the statutory classification under attack was not based on race, sex, illegitimacy, or other similar factors, nor did it impinge on a fundamental right. The estate conceded that the purpose of the Act was to promote close family relationships. Therefore, the classification at issue constituted a legitimate state purpose and the legislature had established an appropriate means to satisfy that purpose. The estate failed to meet its burden and the trial court did not err as a matter of law in dismissing its appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was charged with one count of miscellaneous inappropriate behavior pursuant to the school district's discipline code for his alleged involvement in the threatened assault of another student by a third student. The charges arose from an incident in which the third student took a metal-tipped dart to school with intent to throw it at another student. The dart was found at the student's home, and the student knew of the third student's intent and did nothing to stop him. The trial court held that the disciplinary provision in question was unconstitutionally vague. The reviewing court disagreed. The reviewing court found that any eight-year-old child knew or should have known that knowledge of the intent of another child to throw a dart in order to injure a third child was behavior that could be harmful to others, and, therefore, was wrong, and that, if the action resulted in harm on school property, he or she would be in &quot;trouble&quot; at school. No more was needed to impose appropriate discipline. Further, the reviewing court held that the punishment did not rise to a constitutional deprivation of a property right requiring redress through the judicial system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bus rear-ended the injured party's car. The appellate court held the damages limitation against the local bus company to permanent loss of bodily function cases, under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8553(c)(2)(ii), did not violate equal protection, as the injured party did not say she was in a protected class, recovering negligence damages was not a fundamental right, and the limitation served a legitimate government interest. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not letting the injured party show evidence supporting an adverse inference charge due to appellees' failure to produce a neurologist's independent medical examination report, as her own neurologist did not see her, she did not try to compel the report's production, and did not seek the information in her discovery. Refusing to let her medical records go to the jury room was not an abuse of discretion, when the jury asked if she wore a seat belt, and the records said she did, as the jury did not seek medical treatment information, and there was no seat belt use testimony. Excluding her wage loss testimony to show a loss of bodily function was correct, where nothing in the record showed an inability to work.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant accepted a severance package as part of a reduction in force program. He applied for unemployment compensation. Although it was determined that he was eligible for benefits, the benefits were reduced to the point of elimination, pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 804(d)(2). The decision was affirmed by a referee and then by an order of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Board of Review. The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant's weekly benefit rate for unemployment benefits was reduced to zero, as he received a monthly pension that was greater than the amount of the benefits. In addition, the claimant's earnings during his base year increased the amount of his pension by at least $ 1 per month. The reviewing court found that the claimant was provided a fair, impartial, and objective hearing. He was provided notice and advised of his rights. He was afforded the opportunity to be heard. The referee's acceptance of a letter from the employer merely informed the referee that its pension was 100 percent employer funded; a fact that the claimant did not dispute. The claimant's contention that his pension decreased as a result of his base year earnings was rejected. The cost of a survivor's annuity benefit, which was deducted from the pension, increased. There was no error in the board's concluding that it was the gross amount of the pension payments that was subject to the offset provisions. The offset statute had a rational basis of preserving the fiscal integrity of the unemployment compensation fund and eliminated duplicative benefits. It was therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The city did not limit its legislation to its own borders. The city clearly was without authority to legislate in the field of domestic relations by defining and creating a new marital status.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee driver was convicted of various offenses of driving under the influence (DUI).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOT argued, inter alia, the DOT had an independent mandate to require that a repeat DUI offender comply with the ignition interlock law, where a court failed or refused to comply with the statutory mandate that it order the interlock installation. The appellate court held that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7002, which required the installation of ignition interlock systems for persons convicted of DUI, clearly sought to promote the compelling interest of protecting citizens, and therefore it did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. However, the appellate court could not reverse the case, because the failure of the trial court to order the installation of the ignition interlock device did not give the DOT the authority to override the trial court's order and require installation. The statute gave the trial court the sole authority to order the installation of an approved ignition interlock device.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6 and 14 adopted by the electorate at the November 3, 1998, general election were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment to Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 added categories of criminal cases in which a person accused of a crime must be denied bail. The amendment to Pa. Const. art.

The trial court held that the bail amendment constituted a single amendment, as it served to reinforce public safety by making it more difficult for seriously dangerous accused criminals to obtain bail. The amendment was properly submitted to the electorate in a single ballot question. The plain English statement sufficiently notified the electors of the purpose, limitations, and effects of the bail amendment, and the general assembly passed the same joint resolutions in two successive sessions. The jury trial ballot question also produced only one substantive change to the Pennsylvania Constitution; to give the Commonwealth the same right to a jury trial as was given to the accused.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant securities agent sought review of a Pennsylvania Securities Commission order which: (1) censured him; (2) suspended his registration as an agent for seven days; (3) ordered him to pay an administrative assessment; (4) ordered him to pay the investigative and legal costs incurred; and (5) ordered him to comply with the Pennsylvania Securities Act of 1972 Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 70, &sect;&sect; 1- 101 to 1- 611.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the participants filed exceptions within a mandated 30-day time period; therefore, review of the hearing officer's proposed order was not initiated by the Commission but by exceptions. As the February 20, 2001, Commission order was outside the time limit in 1 Pa. Code &sect; 35.226(a)(2), the Commission could only dispose of issues properly raised by exception. A review of the exceptions filed by the Commission's staff showed that the staff did not raise any issues or exceptions as to two investors and waived the issues with regard to them. Therefore, the Commission erred in finding violations of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 70, &sect; 1-305(a)(ix). The agent admitted to failing to file annual reports under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 70, &sect; 1-304 and 64 Pa. Code &sect; 304.022. Findings of violations of those laws were supported. The finding that the agent failed to maintain trial balances was not supported by substantial evidence where the investigator's testimony used to make the finding was unrebutted and the investigator's belief that the agent did not keep or make trial balances was unsupported by any reference to records supporting the belief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed as to the portion based on the Commission's findings and conclusions that the agent engaged in unethical conduct and practices in the securities business and as to the portion based on the findings that the agent failed to maintain trial balances. It was affirmed as to the findings that the agent failed to comply with certain reporting and record keeping requirements. The matter was remanded for penalty imposition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee appealed the order of respondent Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Appeal Board affirming the decision of a workers' compensation judge, who granted the employee's claim petition but limited his benefits in accordance with Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee suffered a career-ending knee injury while playing professional football. The employee's weekly wage was $ 8,075. Under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 565, the employee's partial disability benefit rate was calculated based upon two times the statewide average weekly wage of $ 588 rather than the employee's actual weekly wage. Section 565 was only applicable to professional athletes that made more than eight times the average weekly wage. The employee claimed that &sect; 565 violated equal protection, because he received less benefits than others who made the same wage and lower-paid professional athletes. The employee's claim was subject to rational basis scrutiny, as professional athletes were not a suspect class or a sensitive classification, and &sect; 565 implicated no fundamental or important right. The classification had a rational basis, as the legislature could have rationally concluded that lower-paid athletes had a greater need for partial disability benefits than higher-paid athletes. Professional athletes could be treated differently from others, because they willfully risked injury for lucrative compensation while providing an insignificant service to society.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a township designated an area as blighted, under the Local Economic Revitalization Tax Assistance Act (LERTA), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. &sect;&sect; 4722-4727, the school district authorized tax exemptions for property in that area. When the township designated a second area, containing the taxpayer's property, as blighted, the school district did not grant tax relief. The appellate court held the district did not have to enact a LERTA ordinance when the township designated the area, and its failure to enact such an ordinance was neither capricious nor discriminatory. The failure to authorize exemptions for the taxpayer's property, after authorizing them for previously designated property, did not violate the Uniformity Clause in Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, because the taxpayer's property was treated uniformly with other deteriorated property as defined by the district. The taxpayer had no right to a hearing under LERTA. A hearing was required only when an adjudication was issued, under 2 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 553. The taxpayer had no property right in a tax exemption not authorized by the district, so neither a hearing nor an adjudication was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer was sued by the insureds who alleged its surplus violated its status as a non-profit corporation. The insurer asked the Department to decide that (1) it had to maintain its reserves levels until the Department ruled otherwise; (2) it could not disgorge its reserves unless the Department ruled otherwise; and (3) the insureds could not challenge the Department's decisions regarding the insurer's rates and reserves without exhausting administrative remedies. The appellate court held the insurer sought a declaratory judgment in anticipation of events that might never occur, as it was not known if the trial court in the insureds' suit would accept jurisdiction, in whose favor it would rule, or what remedy it would order. The Department had no authority to determine the trial court's jurisdiction so the insurer could not show its petition would terminate a controversy or remove uncertainty, as the insureds' case would proceed in the trial court despite the Department's ruling. The Department's denial of the insurer's petition without a hearing did not deny due process, as no hearing was required under 2 Pa. Cons.

The jury found for the decedent against the officer. The appellate court held the evidence did not show the officer intended to harm the suspect when ordering his pursuit, so the jury's verdict against the officer was not supported under the &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; liability standard under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Data offered to support the claim the city did not enforce its policy about pursuits of suspects made no causal connection between this lack of enforcement and police car pursuits violating substantive due process, did not show the city was the &quot;moving force&quot; in the deprivation of the decedent's constitutional rights, and was properly excluded. Absent a city's employee's unconstitutional action against the decedent, whether the city trained those employees was irrelevant, so nonsuit of the administratrix's claim against the city was proper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A member of the federation filed with the department a revision to its private passenger UM/UIM coverage that would eliminate the arbitration provisions. The revision was disapproved. On appeal, the federation argued that the department had no statutory authority to require the arbitration provisions and the arbitration provisions were not required. Based primarily on the grant of authority in the Uninsured Motorist Coverage Act, specifically Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect; 2000, the court concluded that the department had the authority to approve UM coverage provisions in insurance contracts and to promulgate regulations with respect to such coverage. Thus, the department had the implied authority to require arbitration of UM coverage disputes. The department's statutory and regulatory authority to mandate arbitration of UIM coverage disputes was found in the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, specifically 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1731, which mandated UIM coverage as well as UM coverage, and 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1704(b), which expressly established the department's administrative, regulatory, and enforcement authority over UIM coverage provisions in insurance contracts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the decedent's death, a family member contacted the funeral director by telephone concerning final arrangements and agreed to meet the following day. The family member subsequently contacted another funeral home and met with its director the same day. In the meantime, the funeral director took the body from the hospital and embalmed it. When the second director asked for the body, the funeral director refused to release it until he was paid. The funeral director intimated to the family member that because of his prior affiliation with the Board, the family member's only recourse to obtain the body was to pay the fee. The court held that by failing to obtain express permission, no matter how well intentioned, the funeral director violated the applicable regulations. The matter provided no basis to conclude that 49 Pa. Code &sect; 13.202(11) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board denied the owner's challenge on the ground that the ordinance provided for reasonable and legitimate uses of the property, that the zoning of the property reflected consideration of public health, safety, and morals. The owner argued, inter alia, that because the zoning ordinance required compliance with a comprehensive plan, the desirable land uses under the comprehensive plan became regulatory and controlled the use of his property. The appellate court held that the owner's argument ignored the nature of the comprehensive plan that regardless of whether the ordinance in required compliance with the comprehensive plan, the comprehensive plan itself was simply a general guide that recommended land utilization and that the ordinance prevailed over the general provisions. Thus, the uses specifically listed in the ordinance prevailed over any general recommendation made through the comprehensive plan, even if it was incorporated into the ordinance. The owner failed to establish that the ordinance was arbitrary and unreasonable or that it lacked a relationship to the township's public health, safety, morals, and general welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicants sought an occupancy permit to allow totally nude dancing. Their application and challenges to a city zoning ordinance that prohibited totally nude dancing were denied by appellee city, through its city zoning hearing board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the zoning ordinance was passed, the applicants' establishment had dancing with &quot;pasties&quot; and &quot;G-strings.&quot; The applicants contended that this constituted a preexisting nonconforming use of the premises. The city disagreed, arguing that totally nude entertainment was not similar to scantily clad entertainment. The appellate court agreed with the city and the trial court, and found that totally nude dancing was not sufficiently similar to dancing with &quot;pasties&quot; and a &quot;G-string.&quot; The applicants also argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it failed to provide time constraints on a zoning officer's action on a permit application, and therefore acted as a prior restraint on speech. They also argued it did not address how and where an appeal could be filed, and therefore acted to stifle expression of speech. In rejecting these arguments, the appellate court found that reading the zoning ordinance in conjunction with a statute that required action on an application regulating the operation of a building within 90 days, there was no unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. There were also adequate procedural safeguards for review of a zoning officer's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two game commission officers went to defendant's property to speak to defendant about a purported gaming violation which had occurred four months prior. The officers repeatedly requested that defendant produce identification, but he refused. Because of his refusal to produce identification, one of the officers issued defendant a citation for violation of 34 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 904. On appeal, defendant raised many constitutional issues. The appellate court concluded that 34 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 904 was unconstitutional on its face under the Fourth Amendment because defendant was arrested and convicted for his refusal to identify himself. The officers were investigating purported criminal activity, which had occurred four months previously. Thus, contrary to the Commonwealth's contention, the officers did not have reasonable suspicion of current illegal conduct. The officers had no reason to believe that defendant was engaged in criminal activity authorizing a Terry stop and although the officers could ask questions to defendant, he was not compelled to answer.</SPAN></P>

In the instant matter, the employer's insurer requested that the workers' compensation bureau review the worker's third-party settlement, for the purpose of calculating the insurer's entitlement to subrogation funds in the future. The workers' compensation judge (WCJ) determined that the common pleas court had authority to settle all matters before it, including subrogation issues. The appeal board disagreed, and found that the common pleas court lacked jurisdiction to eliminate or modify the subrogation rights, and remanded the matter. On appeal of the board's remand order, the appellate court found that the instant matter had not yet been resolved within the workers' compensation system. The board's order did not dispose of all of the claims, and it was not a final order within the meaning of Pa. R. App. P. 341. The board's order was interlocutory, and not appealable as of right. The worker had not asked the appellate court for permission to file an interlocutory appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation was insolvent, and received substantial debt forgiveness. The state revenue department regarded the amount forgiven as &quot;income per books&quot; in calculating stock value, for capital stock tax liability purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in the instant action was whether cancellation of the corporation's indebtedness was to be included in &quot;income per books&quot; for state capital stock tax purposes. In reaching its decision, the court panel had concluded that the term &quot;income per books,&quot; as applied to a non-chapter S corporation, had acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning derived from federal tax law. Upon reconsideration, the full court found error in this application of the federal income tax law. There was no requirement for Pennsylvania to adopt federal &quot;taxable income&quot; in its calculation of capital stock value, and Pennsylvania had not done so. The corporation argued that because it was insolvent, as defined under the federal tax code, its stock was necessarily worthless. In rejecting this argument, the full court found that a corporation could be technically insolvent and still have stock that was valuable. The department performed its calculation of capital stock value according to express statutory provisions and in accordance with its regulations. The department's decision was entitled to deference. The corporation failed to meet its heavy burden of establishing error or unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the licensee pled guilty under a civil reservation to drunk driving in New Jersey, Pennsylvania's transportation agency suspended his driver's license for one year pursuant to the Interstate Driver's License Compact codified at 75 Pa.

The licensee's other arguments were quickly resolved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A township enacted an ordinance that established a water district and authorized the installation of water lines. A board of viewers was appointed to assess each property benefitted by the lines. Although the association owned a large tract of land, only a small portion would use water from the lines. The appellate court held that because the ordinance was lawful it did not matter that the board was appointed after the repeal took effect. Although the assessment method used by the township to recoup the cost of the water lines did not affect the township's substantive rights, it did affect those of the property owners. The board's final report contained no findings, conclusions of law, or explanation as to how it ascertained the benefit to each property. Thus, the appellate court could not determine whether substantial evidence existed to support the assessment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife and a citizens' group with relatives in prison alleged that the telephone companies' rates for collect calls from inmates were unreasonable and unconstitutional. The court held that the wife's challenge to the legalities of the bidding procedures was a matter not properly before the PUC for determination. The rates for collect calls from prisons were comparable to those for collect calls made from public pay phones. The lack of competitive alternatives in telephone carriers was an &quot;unfortunate incidence of incarceration. The group failed to establish that prison inmates, many of whom belong to racial minorities, were a suspect class, or that the rates for inmate collect telephone calls evinced discriminatory intent. An inmate's right to telephone access was conditioned upon rational limitations in light of the prison's legitimate security interests.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 102, authorized to make arrests on the premises, made the arrest outside of his territorial jurisdiction, and the supreme court noted that the commonwealth court had reached conflicting results as to the effect of extraterritorial arrests. The commonwealth court held that, since the case was an administrative and not criminal proceeding, the officer had the authority to &quot;factually&quot; arrest the driver, even though the arrest may not have been valid for criminal purposes, and attempt to administer sobriety tests. Therefore, the license suspension was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, first paramedic and second paramedic, petitioned for review of an order of respondent Pennsylvania Department of Health. That order dismissed the paramedics' appeals, revoked the first paramedic's certifications as an emergency medical technician (EMT) and paramedic, and placed the second paramedic's certifications as an EMT and paramedic on probationary status for two years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first paramedic was executive director of an ambulance company. He had a 1990 out-of-state conviction of obstructing government operations. In 1993, another state revoked the first paramedic's certification as a paramedic. When soliciting business, the first paramedic falsely informed a hospital representative that the company was authorized to transport advanced life support (ALS) patients. When the company applied for an ALS license, the first paramedic pursued the license through aggressive daily phone calls to the licensing office. These calls led to criminal charges being filed against him. The department properly pursued sanctions against the first paramedic under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 6931(j.1)(1)(xiv), as he had been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude. Obstructing government operations was a crime of moral turpitude. The department properly determined that the company was not staffed by responsible persons under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 6932(h)(1). The first paramedic was not a responsible person, as he lied to hospital officials, violated Pennsylvania law in arranging for the transport of an ALS patient, and harassed members of the licensing staff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several different owners had operated a nightclub on the premises, near residential property, continuously since 1969. In 1977, the city enacted a zoning code provision that forbade certain sexually explicit entertainment within 500 feet of residential property. Over the years, the original rock 'n' roll club had become an adult cabaret, and the landowner eventually obtained a temporary variance in order to be licensed. When that variance expired, neighborhood residents sought to shut it down and the zoning board denied a permanent variance. The appeals court held, first, that the landowner's nonconforming use, if any, was extinguished by the temporary variance. The instant proceeding was too different from prior proceedings, and the landowner's conduct too disingenuous, for res judicata or collateral estoppel to apply. The trial court was not obliged to provide a de novo hearing, and substantial evidence supported the board's decision. The landowner's free speech issue was waived.</SPAN></P>

The WCJ determined the employer was entitled, under 77 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 71(a), to take a credit for severance benefits paid to the claimant. On appeal, the claimant argued the employer was not entitled to a credit for the payment because the payment did not fall within the definition of &quot;severance&quot; contained in the regulations, and alternatively, even if the payment was deemed to be severance, it was not subject to offset under 77 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 71(a). The court determined that the claimant's first argument had to fail because the record contained no evidence to establish that the payment in question was not severance as defined in the regulations. However, the court concluded, because the employer was not directly liable for the payment of compensation to the claimant and because the entity that was directly liable for such compensation was not the employer, there was no entitlement to a credit pursuant to 77 Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were (1) entities having non-utility generator (NUG) must take contracts with the utility, (2) power marketers, independent power producers, and companies supporting electric power supply competition, and (3) public interest/environmental groups. Petitioners had due process notice with respect to the stipulation's adoption as it was similar to a prior proposal. The utility had sold all its generation capacity. The commission had power to eliminate certain NUG competitive transition charges. The court reversed the stipulation's (1) deferral accounting mechanism (DTM) as a way for the utility to recover certain of its excess provider of last resort (PLR) costs as they did not meet the requirements for relief from the rate cap imposed and were not stranded costs under a competition act, and (2) elimination of the code of conduct. The court found the commission had substantial evidence to find that the merger was in the public interest and would not have anti-competitive effects, that it did not abuse its discretion by not addressing environmental concerns of the merger, and that there were consumer savings to be determined later in connection with the rate cap issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court's judgment (1) affirmed the order approving the merger, but remanded to the commission only to determine the amount of merger savings and the allocation of those savings, and (2) reversed the order regarding the utility's DTM recovery of PLR costs and denied the utility's rate relief request. The court also denied motions, filed by respondents, utility, and successor, to quash the petitions for review filed by petitioners.</SPAN></P>

Secondly, the evidence was more than sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Finally, although the trial court erred in ruling that Pa. R. Crim. P. 122(A), which provided for appointment of counsel in certain summary proceedings where a defendant faced possible incarceration, was inapplicable, the error was harmless because the trial court also determined that defendant could afford counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provider did not submit the individual residents' original invoices within the required 180 days of treatment, because it did not receive notices of the individuals' medical assistance eligibility until after the 180-day deadline had passed. When it received notice, the provider, contrary to 55 Pa. Code &sect; 1101.68(d), submitted electronic original invoices for payment. Because they were submitted after the 180-day period, they were rejected as untimely. The provider eventually submitted invoice exception requests, but these were rejected as untimely pursuant to 55 Pa. Code &sect; 1101.68(c)(1).  55 Pa. Code &sect; 1101.68 was not contrary to federal legislation and regulations. The time limitations under &sect; 1101.68 were reasonable, and the department's strict compliance with the time limitations was in accordance with Pennsylvania case law. The department's rejection of the claims did not amount to an unconstitutional forfeiture under the Eighth Amendment, because the provider had only an expectation of federal assistance, and the provider failed to comply with regulations that entitled the provider to that assistance.</SPAN></P>

The PUC had issued a policy statement which obviated an examination of public need with respect to limousine service. The PUC also found that the record established a public need for the service. The court held that, pursuant to 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1103(a), the PUC was required to find that the granting of a certificate of public convenience was necessary or proper for the service, accommodation, convenience, or safety of the public. The PUC was not allowed to eliminate the burden of showing a public demand or need for limousine service. The testimony did not support the PUC's finding of public demand or need for the proposed service and assertions made in exceptions to an ALJ's decision did not constitute substantial evidence upon which the PUC could grant a certificate of public convenience. The PUC's finding of public need was not supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a Pennsylvania State Representative and two other residents, brought suit for a declaratory judgment against respondent, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro Tempore of the Pennsylvania Senate, seeking a determination that it was unconstitutional for him to hold both positions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The President Pro Tempore of the Pennsylvania Senate became lieutenant governor, by operation of law, pursuant to Pa. Const. art. IV, &sect; 14. He did not resign his position as president pro tempore, and petitioners argued that by holding both offices he violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court found that petitioners had standing to bring the action, as there was a real possibility that the issue called into question might otherwise go unchallenged. In addition, the issue was justiciable, and not a political question, as it was a compelling issue requiring a thoughtful and studied interpretation of the relevant constitutional provisions. In interpreting the Pennsylvania Constitution, the court found that the unambiguous language of Pa. Const. art. IV, &sect; 14, only required the president pro tempore of the senate to resign his senatorial seat if he became governor. The issue of whether a resignation would be required upon becoming lieutenant governor was specifically debated, with the framers of &sect; 14 expressly and unanimously making their intent clear by deleting language that would have required a resignation upon becoming lieutenant governor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pennsylvania passed a statute, the Education Empowerment Act (EEA), former Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 17-1701-B et seq., that effectively created a class of one particular school district and gave defendant city mayor power over the school district's affairs, because the school district was performing poorly. The statute was found to be unconstitutional under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32, which prohibited the legislature from passing a special law regulating school districts. The legislature then amended the EEA by passing the School Improvement Statute (SIS). The SIS did not make any changes to the authority given to the mayor. The secretary of education filed preliminary objections to the individual's petition, which sought to enjoin the commonwealth from implementing Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 17-1707-B (2000). In ruling on the preliminary objections, the court found that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 17-1707-B (2000) violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32 and Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two individuals and their businesses, appealed the enactment of an ordinance, as procedurally deficient. They alleged appellee board of supervisors had complied with the Pennsylvania Municipal Law for Second Class Townships, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 65101 et seq. The Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County (Pennsylvania) dismissed their appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The businesses appealed the dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found there were two statutory provisions regarding the method by which one must challenge the procedure in enacting or adopting an ordinance. One provision provided for the filing of a complaint, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 66601(f), and the other provided for an appeal, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5571(c)(5). The appellate court found the provisions in the two statutory provisions were irreconcilable, and turned to the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1936, to determine that the statute with the latest date of final enactment would prevail. In the instant action, the latest statute was the one providing for the use of a complaint to challenge the adoption of an ordinance. Although the businesses filed an initial appeal, and not a complaint, in challenging the ordinance at issue, the appellate court found they should not be penalized for the form of their action.

It did not cover noise caused by manufacturing machinery. The Commonwealth failed to prove that the company's machinery was generating noise sufficient to disturb the peace and tranquility of the general public.

Additionally, the mining company petitioned for review of that same order in which the board required the department to recalculate its subsidence bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners were within the boundary of a subsidence control plan for a coal mining activity permit issued to the mining company. The department had approved the revision of its coal mining activity permit which also added underground acreage to the mine permits and five-year subsidence control plan areas for a mine. The court held that no taking occurred. Since the property owners failed to allege that any property right had been affected, their due process argument failed. Nothing was to be construed to prohibit planned subsidence. Mine operators were only required to adopt measures to prevent such damage to the extent that it was technologically or economically feasible. Pollution had to affect the &quot;uses&quot; of the water and the board clearly applied that standard. The mining company had set forth a step-by-step procedure describing how affected water supplies would be replaced in the event that pre-existing water resources were disrupted its mining activities. Determinations of the bond amount were intended to be made on a case-by-case basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner wanted to use a tract of land atop a mountain for a sandstone quarry.

Excluding quarrying from the forest district did not result in an unconstitutional taking of the owner's subsurface mineral estate. The quarrying would have increased the dust, noise, air pollution, truck traffic, and damage to homes from the use of explosives. Thus, the ordinance related to the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, and there was no unconstitutional taking under the ordinance. The exclusion of quarrying from the forest district did not amount to a de facto total exclusion of quarrying, because 1,900 acres of the town's 17,110 acres could be quarried.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee argued that New Jersey's DUI statute was not substantially similar to Article IV(a)(2) of the Driver's License Compact, the dual suspensions of his operating privileges violated his rights to due process, equal protection, and double jeopardy, his due process rights were violated because he was not informed that his New Jersey conviction would result in suspension of his Pennsylvania privileges, the Pennsylvania General Assembly did not intend to create a two-tiered system of punishment for first-time offenders, and the compact constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the executive branch. The appellate court previously held that New Jersey's DUI statute was substantially similar to Article IV(a)(2) of the compact, thus, rejecting the licensee's argument regarding substantial similarity. The court also noted that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court previously specifically rejected each of the licensee's arguments, and that the licensee's argument that he was not informed was without merit. Finally, the court rejected the licensee's constitutionality argument because the compact did not become law until the general assembly formally adopted it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether the school's exclusion of women from its student body precluded it from claiming an exemption as a purely public charity. The school's exclusion of women did not preclude it from satisfying the constitutional requirement that it benefit a substantial and indefinite class of persons who were legitimate subjects of charity. Had the legislature intended to deny exemptions to all discriminatory institutions, it could have so provided. Instead, it specifically excluded only those institutions whose discrimination was in violation of state or federal law. Since the appellate court had to assume that the legislature was aware of the longstanding precedents holding that single gender institutions fell within the definition of &quot;purely public charity,&quot; it concluded that the Purely Public Charity Act of November 26, 1997, Pub. L. No. 508, Penn. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 371-385, intended no change in that construction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorneys for certain workers' compensation claimants filed an original proceeding for declaratory and injunctive relief against respondent commonwealth officials, arguing that the officials exceeded their powers in limiting contingent fees. The officials' preliminary objections included failure to exhaust remedies provided by 77 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 998.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pennsylvania's workers' compensation laws permitted claimants and attorneys to negotiate fees among themselves, but also required a workers' compensation judge to specifically approve a fee in excess of 20 percent of an award. A denial of such approval was appealable to the workers' compensation agency, and, ultimately, to a court. Several attorneys whose fee agreements calling for larger percentage fees had not been approved sought immediate declaratory and injunctive relief, before the agency had acted on their appeals. They argued that because they were challenging the action as an unconstitutional exercise of power that belonged in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, they were not required to exhaust their administrative remedies. The court held that because there was no reason to suppose that the administrative appeals would have been futile, the request for court action was premature. A declaratory judgment action could not be used to collaterally attack an administrative tribunal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a plea of guilty with civil reservation, the motorist was originally convicted in New Jersey of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor/drugs. The DOT notified the motorist that his driving privilege was suspended for one year for the conviction in New Jersey. The trial court originally sustained the motorist's appeal, finding 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1584&nbsp;unconstitutional. On review, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1584 was constitutional. On remand, the trial court found in favor of the DOT on all five of the issues listed for review. However, the trial court added a sixth issue and ruled that since the New Jersey information relating to the date of conviction was factually wrong there was no factual basis to support the notice of suspension. The appellate court held that a trial court committed reversible error when it raised an issue sua sponte and decided a case based on that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner teachers, parents, and taxpayers filed a petition for review challenging the constitutionality of the Education Empowerment Act (EEA), 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 17-1701-B to 17-1716-B, which amended the Public School Code, 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-101 to 27-2702 . Respondents, governor and secretary of education, and intervenor state senators filed preliminary objections asserting inter alia, lack of ripeness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were from school districts that had been identified as having a history of low-test performance. They sought a pre-enforcement declaration that the EEA was unconstitutional, contending that when their respective school districts were placed on the empowerment list they lost statutory rights they had previously possessed due to the possibility that teachers might be reassigned, suspended, or dismissed, and/or schools might be converted to charter schools. In addition, a board of control might have been established. The court held the mere possibility that a district may take any of the measures of which petitioners complained did not present a sufficiently concrete case in which to conduct an inquiry into the constitutionality of the legislation. Because petitioners' constitutional claims were both fact intensive and premised on events that might never occur, those claims were not fit for judicial review. In addition, it was not certain they would be put to costly choices if they were denied pre-enforcement review. Also, if the events did occur, then adequate avenues in equity or law existed to protect rights and compensate harm.</SPAN></P>

The court held, first, that it had jurisdiction, concurrent with that of a federal court, to hear the guardsman's appeal because the adjutant general headed a state agency, even though the state militia was funded federally and followed United States Army regulations. There was a justiciable case or controversy because the guardsman had an expectation of continued employment in the absence of cause. Finally, although the guardsman might have made out a case of denial of Pennsylvania due process guarantees, the record supplied by the agency was too skimpy to permit review. Therefore, the court instructed the agency to conduct further proceedings so it could be determined whether the administrative proceeding was adequate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's barking dogs were an annoyance to his neighbor, who called the police. Seven citations were issued as the result of seven different barking episodes. Although defendant had not waived his right to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance, by not raising it before the district justice, the constitutional challenge itself was found to be without merit. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because it referred to offensive conduct as annoying a reasonable person of normal sensitivities, which was found to be an objective standard. The appellate court found a person of ordinary intelligence would understand what conduct violated the ordinance, and therefore, it was constitutional. The testimony of the neighbor, as corroborated by the police, was sufficient to sustain the convictions. Defendant's claim that it was a private nuisance, rather than a public nuisance, was rejected, as the court found excessive dog barking interfered with the public peace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth filed preliminary objections to all five counts of a constitutional challenge, by plaintiff Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, school district and others, to amended 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 17-1707-B, which subjected the district to special rules not applicable to other districts under a statewide educational reform program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pennsylvania's educational reform act contained an exception applicable only to Harrisburg, 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 17-1707-B, which immediately placed the school system under the mayor's control. An earlier version had been invalidated as a special statute violating Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32, and in ruling on the commonwealth's objections to the school district's renewed challenges, the court found the same defect. The provision was plainly crafted to apply only to Harrisburg. It also violated equal protection, in treating Harrisburg differently from other similarly situated school districts, and violated Pa. Const. art. IX and 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 41303 by forcing Harrisburg to change the operation of its home rule charter without voter approval. However, the provision was not an unconstitutional delegation of taxing powers, because the raising of taxes was still subject to court approval, and did not eliminate elected school board members' positions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the objections to the counts alleging special legislation, equal protection violation, and involuntary change in form of city government, but sustained the objections to counts based on improper delegation of the taxing power and unlawful removal of elected officials.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A railroad obtained a right-of-way and constructed 20.7 miles of track in the late 1860s. The railroad filed a request for approval to abandon the line with the United States Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1987, and the ICC issued an order approving that action. In 1991, the railroad conveyed its rights, title, and interest in the right-of-way to a salvage company by quitclaim deed, and three days later, the salvage company conveyed its rights, title, and interests to the township. The appellate court held that (1) the railroad's action of requesting approval from the ICC to abandon the line and of conveying its interest to a salvage company was not sufficient in and of itself to establish abandonment; (2) the trial court had not abused its discretion by finding that the railroad, by reserving the right to reenter and reclaim the right-of-way, had not abandoned the right-of-way; and (3) although township did not receive an interim trail use permit from the ICC before it developed the right-of-way into a public trail, that action was not required under 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1247(d).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner railroad appealed respondent Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission's decision directing removal and reconstruction of rail-highway bridge. Petitioner argued, among other things, that Pennsylvania Public Utility Code &sect;&sect; 2702, 2704, 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 2702, 2704 were preempted by Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act &sect; 10501(b), 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 10501(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner railroad was the successor to the builder of a railway-highway bridge that had not been repaired for 70 years. Respondent Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission directed it to remove and reconstruct the bridge at its own expense. The court upheld respondent's order. First, the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act, at 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 10501(b), specifically preempted many powers over rail carriers, but said nothing about states' traditional rights to regulate rail-highway bridges to protect the public safety. Thus, respondent retained the right it had long exercised under Pennsylvania Public Utility Code &sect; 2702, 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2702. Substantial evidence in the record supported respondent's determination, including imposition of costs, and its opinion sufficiently articulated the bases for its order. Petitioner waived its argument that imposition of costs was an unconstitutional taking, but in any case, federal case law had already decided that issue against petitioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed respondent's decision. The federal act did not preempt this traditional exercise of the police power. Furthermore, respondent's decision was based on substantial evidence, and was adequately articulated. Petitioner waived its unconstitutional taking argument, which was groundless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Licensee, a Pennsylvania resident, was convicted of DUI in New Jersey. The New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles reported licensee's conviction to the bureau. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation notified licensee that pursuant to the Drivers License Compact of 1961, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1581, his Pennsylvania driving privilege would be suspended for a period of one year based on his New Jersey conviction. Licensee raised several issues for review. First, licensee argued that the information on the New Jersey report was insufficient to sustain the suspension pursuant to the compact, in that it did not reference the identity of the court in which licensee was convicted nor was there an indication of the plea or whether the conviction resulted from a forfeiture of security. The omission did not deprive licensee of the constitutional right to due process because the title of the violation provided sufficient notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. The amendment to the compact set forth at 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1584 was not an unconstitutional amendment of the multilateral compact.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 66.1-66.4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant research service provided information to title companies, including information about currency of property tax payments. When its requests for information became too burdensome for appellee tax collector's office, the local township raised fees for providing information and lengthened the waiting period. Appellant responded with a request for access to all tax payment records pursuant to the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Act, 65 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 66.1-66.4. The appellate court upheld denial of the request. The statute listed a finite group of state agencies to which the law applied. The only category within which appellee conceivably fell was municipal authorities, but definitions of that term in various statutes made it clear that it referred only to bodies with authority to enact ordinances. Appellee was simply an elected official who collected taxes and submitted information to the township. A disclosure action could be properly brought against the township, but not against appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed dismissal of the appeal. Appellee, an elected official, was not a state agency within the meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant estate owned a glass mosaic located in the lobby of a building previously sold by the decedent. It sought to sell the mosaic to fund the decedent's charitable bequests, at which point appellee city historical commission commenced proceedings, culminating in the mosaic's designation as a historic object, which prevented the sale from proceeding. The reviewing court upheld appellant's efforts to seek judicial review of appellee's action under the Pennsylvania Local Agency Law, 2 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 751-754, despite a trial court's initial determination that its review was premature. The only possible avenue of administrative review would have been to a board that dealt with license and inspection appeals, not appeals of historical designations. Where administrative review would have been futile, exhaustion was excused. Furthermore, the issue was ripe for review because the historic object designation appropriateness issue was fully developed and appellant was already suffering hardship from delay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner appealed decisions of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) claiming defective search warrants and court error relating to the forfeiture of property, currency, and funds allegedly used in the sale and distribution of drug paraphernalia.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based upon information of illegal activity, police set up a surveillance of, and obtained search warrants for, owner's store and home. Owner was not convicted of a crime, but his property was forfeited. He appealed. The appellate court held that police observation supported the warrant's issuance. Since the warrant was based upon activities in Philadelphia and was issued there, the court had jurisdiction to issue it. Any money deposited or transferred to different accounts were traceable to owner's illegal business. Owner presented no evidence of a legitimate source of income to explain the assets. The Commonwealth failed to support forfeiture of funds deposited prior to the time it proved operation of an illegal business. All monies deposited prior to that time had to be returned unless it could be shown they were used to facilitate the illegal business after it was in existence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders forfeiting funds prior to proof of an illegal activity were vacated and remanded to determine when the illegal activity was in existence. All other orders were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The township and the county refused to approve the project, however, and, as a result, the DOT refused to consider association's application. The commonwealth court held that &sect; 2210 was unconstitutional because it gave special powers to municipal governments in only one of three counties classified as second class A counties, and was therefore a special law prohibited by Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 32, 20; there was no rational basis for the distinction &sect; 2210 created among the three second class A counties, and &sect; 2210 therefore violated association's equal protection rights; and because &sect; 2210 permitted municipalities to ignore federal policy that airport funding decisions be based, in part, on safety and security needs, and the needs of the national airport system, it was an improper delegation of legislative power from the general assembly to a township.</SPAN></P>

A workers' compensation judge denied the penalty petition, and the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Appeal Board affirmed the decision. Petitioner appealed the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's employer's insurance carrier sent a verification form to petitioner for completion. Petitioner failed to return the form within the required 30 day time period, and the insurance company suspended benefits. Benefits were reinstated as of the date petitioner returned the form. Petitioner argued that the Workers' Compensation Appeal Board erred in denying the penalty petition. The court held that 77 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 631.1(c)-(e), (g), did not violate petitioner's due process rights. The suspension of benefits resulted from petitioner failure to return the verification form in the required time period. The form contained a notice that failure to return the notice would result in suspension of benefits. Thus, the court held petitioner was provided with notice and the opportunity to submit the required information prior to the suspension of benefits. The court held that petitioner's employer was not required to retroactively reinstate benefits. The relevant statutory provisions provided that payment of benefits would resume when a claimant ultimately complied with the statutory requirements, and did not require retroactive payment.</SPAN></P>

More specifically, plaintiff argued defendants were operating as health clubs as defined by the HCA and that their business practices did not comply with the HCA. Defendants responded that their karate centers were not health clubs under the HCA. The court advised that &sect; 2 of the HCA, 73 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2162, defined the term &quot;health club&quot; as, inter alia, an enterprise offering facilities for the preservation, maintenance, encouragement, or development of physical fitness or physical well-being. The court found that although defendants' advertisements at times stressed the physical fitness benefits of its program, the record lacked evidence of any fitness program offered by defendants other than martial arts/karate instruction.

Pennsylvania treated appellant's New York conviction as a violation of Pennsylvania's DUI statute and suspended his operating privileges for one year.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue (Department) issued a notice of determination to petitioner, assignee of a real property foreclosure bid, that petitioner had underpaid the transfer tax. Petitioner moved for a redetermination, which the Department of Revenue Board of Appeals denied. The Board of Finance and Revenue sustained the Department's determination. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the determination of the Department that valued the transfer tax based on the computed value of the realty, rather than the actual amount paid. The court found that it was the proper tax on the sheriff's conveyance of the real estate to petitioner which was the subject of the dispute. Petitioner, as assignee to the prevailing bid at the sheriff's foreclosure sale, took legal title to the realty by receipt of a sheriff's deed reciting consideration, which was far less than the actual monetary worth of the property. The transaction fell squarely within 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8101-C(2), which mandated the computation of the taxable value under the formula used by the Department. Additionally, petitioner had no evidentiary basis for the assertion that the assignment price was the true value of the property, or could the Department disregard the formula mandated by &sect; 8101-C(2) for determining value. Finally, there was no absence of uniformity in taxation; petitioner was taxed on the realty's computed value in the same manner as any other non-mortgagee purchaser at a foreclosure sale. Thus, there was no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed as petitioner took legal title to the realty by receipt of a sheriff's deed reciting consideration, which was far less than the actual worth of the property. Thus, the computation of the taxable value under the formula used by the Department was mandated by statute. Further, the Department did not abuse its discretion by not basing the tax on the actual consideration. Finally, the tax scheme was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Further, because appellee did not deny that he was convicted of DUI in Ohio, which was the reporting state, or that he knew why appellant was seeking to suspend his license, the absence from the Ohio report of a citation to the particular statute under which he was convicted did not violate his due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed from a decision of the Department of Public Welfare (Pennsylvania), which adopted a hearing officer's adjudication and recommendation to deny petitioner's request to expunge an indicated report of sexual abuse of a child that was filed against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an investigation, an indicated report of child abuse was filed against petitioner. He appealed the report and a hearing was held. The hearing officer found that the testimony of the investigator and the victim was credible and substantial evidence was presented that the indicated report of child abuse was accurate. After the Department of Public Welfare adopted hearing officer's recommendation, petitioner appealed, arguing that there was no substantial evidence to support the hearing officer's determinations, and the acts attributed to petitioner did not fall within the statutory definition of child abuse. The court affirmed. Petitioner failed to properly preserve the issue of the appropriate standard of evidence because he failed to raise it in any proceeding at the agency level; thus, the court refused to consider it for the first time in a judicial appeal. Additionally, after reviewing the record, the court found that substantial evidence fully supported the finding that the indicated report of child abuse was accurate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Affirmed. Petitioner's acts, as found by the Department of Public Welfare (DPW), clearly supported the conclusion that petitioner, at the very least, sexually exploited the victim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the Common Pleas Court of the County of Franklin, 39th Judicial District, (Pennsylvania), upholding a one-year suspension of his motor vehicle operating privileges by appellee, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1581.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pennsylvania and Virginia were members of the Driver's License Compact of 1961 (Compact), 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1581-1585. Under the Compact, the party states agreed to inform the other states of violations of each party state's motor vehicle laws to promote compliance with those laws. Appellant was convicted of driving under the influence in violation of a Commonwealth of Virginia. Pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1581, art. III, Virginia notified appellee, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, of appellant's conviction. Appellee suspended appellant's operating privileges in Pennsylvania. The court held that the Virginia statute and the Pennsylvania statute were substantially similar and therefore, appellant's Virginia conviction supported the suspension of appellant's operating privileges in Pennsylvania. The court held that Virginia was not required to comply with art. III and &sect; 1584 reporting requirements as those only applied to instances in which Pennsylvania was reporting a conviction to another member state. Thus, the one-year suspension of appellant's motor vehicle operating privileges was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Pennsylvania and Virginia were members of the Driver's License Compact of 1961, which required the member states to report violations of each state's motor vehicle laws. The DUI laws in the two states were substantially similar. Thus, the one-year suspension of appellant's license in Pennsylvania was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed Allegheny County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) order denying post-trial relief and upholding defendant town's special assessment for a transportation development district under the Pennsylvania Transportation Partnership Act, 53 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pennsylvania Transportation Partnership Act, 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1621-1626, permitted municipalities to set up transportation development districts and assess benefited property owners for part of the cost of improvements based on benefits received. Plaintiff landowners raised numerous grounds in challenging an assessment by defendant town. The court upheld the assessment. The formula was not arbitrary or the result of an improper delegation of power, because the statute made the conferring of benefits the standard in devising assessment formulas, and the trial court reasonably found that providing plaintiffs' property with access to a limited access highway was a benefit. Eminent domain statutes specifically provided that they had no application to such a situation. Finally, the title of the statute was sufficiently descriptive to survive challenge under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. It mentioned local government and transportation improvements. Assessment did not have to be part of the title.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order, because the assessment formula was not arbitrary, eminent domain law had no application, the title of the statute was not misleading, and it provided sufficient standards in assessing property so that there was no unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed Bradford County Common Pleas Court (Pennsylvania) denial of certification that she had completed alcohol treatment program under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1541(d), enabling her to have driving privileges restored. She argued that failure to pay restitution was not grounds for denial and that statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner was sentenced for drunk driving, she was sentenced to incarceration, fines, and mandatory alcohol treatment at her own expense, and ordered to pay restitution to injured pedestrians. Years later she sought reinstatement of driving privileges under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1541(d), which permitted restoration upon a finding that a person on suspension had complied with orders regarding treatment programs and any other requirements. The court heard the appeal for reasons of judicial economy, although it normally heard administrative rather than criminal appeals, which it determined the case to be. It held that the statutory language dealing with any other requirement set by a court permitted the trial court to deny certification of completion to a petitioner who failed to pay court-ordered restitution. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to petitioner because she knew from the day of sentencing what she had to do to comply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed denial of certification, because statute made it clear that a trial court could set requirements in addition to participation in a treatment program. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied because from the time of disposition petitioner knew exactly what she had to do to comply.</SPAN></P>

The court held that 75 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing sought reversal of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County, Pennsylvania that sustained the statutory appeal of appellee licensee from a one-year suspension of his driving privilege, based on failure to fully comply with the Drivers License Compact of 1961.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (Department) notified appellee licensee that his Pennsylvania driving privilege would be suspended for a period of one year because of a North Carolina conviction equivalent to driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. At trial, the fundamental issue was whether the packet of documents certified under seal and offered into evidence by appellant Department satisfied requirements of the Drivers License Compact of 1961 (Compact). The trial court found the out-of-state conviction report failed to provide sufficient information. The court reversed, holding the information was sufficient to allow the forum state (Pennsylvania) to rely on the information contained in the report, even if the report lacked some information specified in art. III of the Compact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order sustaining the respondent licensee reversed because the information submitted from the state of conviction comported with the requirements of the Drivers License Compact. The trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that the documents submitted were not in compliance, and the suspension of appellee's driving privilege was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners appealed from the decision of the Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the decisions of workers' compensation judges dismissing their claims for hearing loss benefits under &sect; 2 of the Workers' Compensation Act, 1995 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed claims for workers' compensation benefits sometime after August 1995, alleging that they suffered a compensable work-related hearing loss caused by continuous exposure to hazardous occupational noise during the course of their employment with their employers. Because the evidence indicated that each petitioner's hearing loss due to occupational noise was 10 percent or less, the workers' compensation judges dismissed the claims pursuant to &sect; 306(c)(8)(iii) of the Workers' Compensation Act, 77 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 513(8). A consolidated appeal by petitioners followed. The court found that because petitioners filed their petitions after the date of the enactment of the Workers' Compensation Act, 1995 Pa. Laws 1 (Act 1), the 10 percent recovery threshold in &sect; 306(c)(8)(iii) of the act applied. Petitioners did not meet that threshold, and they were precluded from recovering benefits. Because petitioners had no cognizable substantive right and filed their claims after Act 1 was enacted, and because Act 1 affected procedural and not substantive rights, petitioners' due process and equal protection rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dismissal of petitioner's claims was affirmed, as hearing loss due to occupational noise was less than 10 percent, which was threshold required by applicable workers' compensation statute, and petitioners' due process and equal protection rights were not violated by retroactive application of workers' compensation statute.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence to suggest government funding to plaintiff was insufficient to allow plaintiff to meet the needs of the persons whom it was serving. Thus it did not relieve the government of some of its burden and failed to demonstrate it qualified as a purely public charity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Commonwealth suspended appellant's operating privilege after receiving notification from another State that appellant had been convicted of an offense. Appellant filed a petition for review with the trial court, claiming that the suspension violated his due process rights and that his conviction in the other state was not for an offense that was subject to suspension in Pennsylvania. The trial court found that the other state's conviction report was deficient because it failed to indicate appellant's plea or whether the conviction was the result of the forfeiture of bail, bond or other security. The court's review of the record revealed that the other state's conviction report did indicate that appellant's conviction was not the result of bond forfeiture. Moreover, appellant himself presented evidence to the trial court indicating that he voluntarily pled guilty to the offense with which he was charged. Indeed, there was nothing in the record to suggest that when appellant received notice of the suspension, appellant did not know what was happening to him and why. Thus, the court concluded that there was no violation of appellant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A group of people were observed hunting in an area containing game feeders and surrounded by bear droppings. The appellants were members of the group charged with violating 34 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2308(8), relating to hunting in areas that had been baited. The trial court found the appellants guilty and their convictions were upheld on appeal. An appeal followed. The issues addressed on appeal were whether the Commonwealth's evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellants were hunting and that they knew or should have known of the existence of the bait was sufficient and whether the statute under which they were convicted was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court's decision in this matter followed a clear, well-reasoned and persuasive path between the thickets of strict liability and criminal intent. A violation of 34 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2308(a)(8) occurred regardless of whether the hunter actually intended to take advantage of the bait if he continued to hunt in an area after he knew or had reason to know that it was a baited area.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought reconsideration of previous affirmance of Pennsylvania trial court's attorneys' fees award denial after previous appeal determined that defendant was not liable for plaintiff town's business privilege tax. Defendant argued that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2503(9) justified award because plaintiff's lawsuit was arbitrary, vexatious, or in bad faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant nonresident contractor's liability for plaintiff town's business privilege tax was overturned on defendant's first appeal, defendant sought review of the trial court's denial of an attorneys' fee award. On appeal, defendant argued primarily that an award was justified under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2503(9) because the underlying collection lawsuit was arbitrary, vexatious, or in bad faith. The court affirmed denial of an award, holding that plaintiff's intense focus of collection efforts on defendant made its actions anything but arbitrary. The fact that plaintiff obtained expert legal opinion regarding a murky area of law before deciding to sue made it clear that its action was not in bad faith. Finally, potential taxpayers always regarded collection efforts as vexatious. That did not make them so. Although defendant also briefly mentioned a right to fees under Pa. R. App. P. 2744, that rule only applied to appellate expenses.</SPAN></P>

VIII rights in that he was prohibited from participating in prerelease programs on the basis of conviction for committing a sex crime. Respondents urged the court to dismiss the petition for failure to state a claim for which relief could have been granted. The court agreed with respondents. Respondents' policy prohibiting convicted sex-offenders from participating in prerelease programs treated all convicted sex offenders alike and was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of protecting the safety of the community; it was also consistent with the purposes of the prerelease program and respondents' explicit reservation of discretion. Finally, for conditions of confinement to constitute unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment, the conditions had to be totally without penological justification and deprive the inmate of the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities. Denying sex offenders the opportunity to participate in prerelease programs was not without penological justification or could it have been construed to have been a necessity deprivation.</SPAN></P>

Respondents argued that petitioner school district lacked standing. However, petitioner was affected because the affairs of operating the school district had been taken away from it. Petitioner had a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in the outcome of the matter, and therefore, had standing. Respondent argued that petitioner failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted when petitioner argued that &sect; 1707 of Act 16 violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32 because it was special legislation. Because &sect; 1707 of Act 16 created a class of one that was merely illusory it did not meet the threshold determination of a genuine class.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the Education Empowerment Act (Act), and specifically &sect; 1705-B(h)(3) of the Act. Defendants filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, contending that petitioners had failed to state claims upon which relief could have been granted. The court granted defendants' preliminary objection as to plaintiffs' claim that the Act violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 31, and otherwise denied the objections. There was a strong likelihood that &sect; 1705-B(h)(3) of the Act would have been declared unconstitutional under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32 because it created a class that was merely illusory, as that class was logically and factually limited to one. Similarly, an equal protection claim had been stated because it was alleged that the school district constituting a class of one had been singled out for unequal treatment. However, the Act did not violate &sect; 31 because it did not delegate power to an administrative agency in a manner separating the power to tax from the power to spend.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed, finding that, because appellee failed to articulate a special need or justification for the policy as applied, the policy invaded the students' privacy rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner requested review of the order of Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement Board, denying his claim for supplemental benefits provided by 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5708.3 that would have increased his pension benefits from July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1996. Having considered the statutory provisions in question, the applicable case law, and the arguments, the court agreed with the board's argument that an award received by petitioner replaced only the first component of the standard single-life formula represented in 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5702(a)(1). The court found no merit in petitioner's contention that the board was judicially estopped from arguing that the Retirement Code's superannuation provision, which set the minimum age eligibility for supplemental benefits for those that retired under the award at age 50, applied to retired state police officers. Judicial estoppel was not applicable in the case. Neither the parties nor the issues were the same in the present case and an earlier case. The order of the board was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision was affirmed. Petitioner was not entitled to supplemental benefits as superannuation provision of state statute governing retirement for state employees did apply to state police officers, and petitioner was not eligible for supplemental benefits as he had not yet reached age 50.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, gas and electric companies, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming certain portions of the Public Utility Realty Tax Act (PURTA), 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8101-A - 8108-A (amended 1971), were invalid because respondent was required to settle, the process of making an administrative determination of any amount owed by the taxpayer, the PURTA Suptax. Without settlement, petitioners claimed they were unable to access required information necessary to request a refund or contest the tax. Respondent then filed preliminary objections. The court denied the objections. Petitioners had complied with their self-assessment which did not satisfy respondent. Respondent's notice of Suptax constituted an intention to use collection provisions. Once respondent exercised its discretion to collect Suptax, which was not self-assessing or self-paying, respondent was required to settle the tax prior to collection. However, PURTA and Suptax were not violative of the law. A refund claim was not an adequate remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Objections overruled because respondent exercised its discretion to employ a collection scheme; thus, the tax was no longer self-assessing or self-paying and respondent was required to settle the Suptax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff college appealed order of Common Pleas Court, Lehigh County (Pennsylvania), dismissing its challenge to a decision of defendant zoning board and holding defendant city's zoning ordinance valid. Plaintiff raised many grounds, including the ordinance's alleged adoption in violation of Pa. Cons. Stat. tit. 53, &sect; 10609 and local ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff college and related parties acquired houses for student housing in a residential zone surrounding the campus. Defendant city sought to limit this activity by amending its zoning ordinance to create a protected zone in which only two students could live in any house. The first effort was defeated. The second, identical to the first except for its effective date, was forwarded to the planning commission 10 days before council action, instead of 30 days ahead of time as required by Pa. Cons. Stat. tit. 53, &sect; 10609 and local ordinance. The court held that the statutory language was mandatory. Although defendant was not required to do as the planning agency recommended, and although there did not have to be a second administrative hearing on an amendment that was largely similar to the first one, compliance with the 30-day advance submission was mandatory, so that the zoning amendment was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order, because failure to timely submit the ordinance to the planning commission for consideration made the ordinance absolutely invalid, even though defendant city was not obliged to follow the commission's advice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A minor obtained work with petitioner by misrepresenting her age as over 18. The minor was injured on the job. Respondent ordered petitioner to pay a 50 percent penalty in addition to standard workers' compensation benefits pursuant to 77 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 672(a), and petitioner appealed the decision. The court held an employer is liable for the penalty mandated by 77 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 672(a) only if it knew or reasonably should have known that the claimant was a minor working illegally. The court found the purpose of the statute was to punish and deter unlawful conduct by employers. The court found imposing the penalty when a minor misrepresented their age would not serve the purpose of the statute. The court held respondent improperly made findings on the issue of whether petitioner reasonably knew the minor misrepresented their age, as fact finding was the sole province of a workers' compensation judge. Therefore, the court reversed and remanded the decision for further findings of fact and conclusions of law.</SPAN></P>

Viewing evidence in light most favorable to plaintiff Commonwealth, jury could have found that accomplice liability was established beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant landowner did not have the right to bury tires because the SWMA clearly prohibited the depositing of solid waste underground. Section 610(1) was not unconstitutionally vague, as it provided sufficient warning as to what acts were proscribed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, Pennsylvania, affirming, and adopting, the decision of appellee Board of Supervisors of West Vincent Township denying appellants' challenge to the validity of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee denied appellants' challenge to the validity of the town's zoning ordinance, concluding that the ordinance did not unconstitutionally exclude, as a land use, the collection and removal of spring water for commercial purposes. Appellants argued that appellee erred in concluding that the ordinance was not exclusionary on the basis that the ordinance permitted the collection and removal of spring water for commercial purposes in the district. The court found that the West Vincent Township, Pennsylvania, Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance) &sect; 1102(A)(4) required only that the use of the land be similar to a public utility operating facility. Section 1904(B)(1) of the Ordinance dealt exclusively with building or street construction and said nothing about water or excluding the collection and removal of spring water for commercial purposes. Appellants failed to meet their burden of proof to show that a spring was not commercially viable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed; the zoning ordinance required only that the use of the land be similar to a public utility operating facility, appellants presented no evidence to show that an identified spring was not commercially viable, thus failing to meet their burden of proof on the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers owned deteriorated commercial property and applied for tax exemptions under The Local Economic Revitalization Tax Assistance Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72 &sect; 4722 et seq. (Act). The Act, as adopted by defendant City of Erie School District, exempted only the portion of the additional assessment attributable to the improvement and for which a separate assessment had been made. After an unrelated court case held that the Act did not authorize local taxing authorities to commence an exemption in a year other than the year after the completion of the improvements, the plaintiffs requested certain refunds, which were denied. They then filed suit under a law which provided for the refund of taxes paid pursuant to an invalid interpretation of a valid statute. The trial court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on the issues of liability, counterclaims, and interest. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Affirmed because plaintiffs did not have to file assessment appeals in order to proceed under Pennsylvania's Refund Act, defendants did not establish a right to a jury trial, refunds were not an extension of the Local Economic Revitalization Tax Assistance Act, there was no tax evasion, and because of waiver.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant taxpayer performed general construction and demolition work within the plaintiff city limits making those gross receipts subject to a three mills tax levied on service businesses. Because defendant refused to pay the tax, the plaintiff brought an action against it to collect taxes due and owing. Holding that the tax was constitutional, the trial court found that the plaintiff's different rate of tax for wholesale, retail and service businesses was permissible because each was a separate and distinct classification allowing for a different tax rate within each of those classes. Defendant taxpayer appealed the decision alleging that the tax violated Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court affirmed the decision holding while a deduction for brokers was null and void, that did not mean that the entire business privilege tax ordinance was invalid, and that defendant was not excused from its obligation to pay.</SPAN></P>

His duties included enforcing orders of the court, issuing arrest warrants, conducting preliminary probation revocation hearings, and reviewing applications to conduct personal and property searches of parolees. He argued that his position was a judicial position, and thus respondent lacked jurisdiction to investigate him. The court agreed with petitioner. The court said petitioner was appointed by a judicial officer and was responsible to that judicial officer.
